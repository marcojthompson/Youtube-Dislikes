"Lol yes, I'm a writer, historian, mom of two teenagers, and I have ADHD and insomnia...my targeted ads seem to think that:

- I am trans (I'm not; just an ally). However, they don't seem sure about my gender, as I get ads for binders, packers, tucking panties, and pocket bras alike. 
- I regularly attend Burning Man. (I've never even thought about going, I just like camping.) 
- I need a home security system (I don't even lock my doors)
- I wear makeup, drink wine, and enjoy scented candles (I do none of those things, but I do take bubble baths?) 
- I am an avid scrapbooker (I guess I do buy a lot of stickers for a woman in her 40s)
- I am an anarchist Republican socialist feminist Catholic teacher who owns a lot of guns (only two of those are accurate)

"ROFL - Asking congress members to please consider the protections that have been in place in western capitalistic countries (except US) for 2-3 decades.
In most contries, the EXISTENCE of person registry data with no registered purpose is a crime. If I want to register 200 customers, because I need to assign rebates to them, that is pretty easy to get my permit. As long as I register the purpose of my record, all is good. If, on the other hand, I want to sell personal information without the knowledge of the consumer, it may be really difficult to obtain permission.
The cool thing is: If I keep a registry, without registering it, that in itself is a punishable crime. I MUST register my purpose, and the extent of my registry, in order to be ""legal"". 
The whole notion of flying under the radar is terminated right then and there: If I sell information, that I'm not registered to be allowed to possess, then my customer and I are both criminals, and the courts can punish&terminate our behavior with no further investigation needed.
So ridiculously simple to legislate, the only reason we don't have it in US is either A - not invented here, or B - corruption of politicians, where more than 50% of congress has been bribed by enemies of personal freedom for Americans.",1,2

"Let's play Last Week Tonight Overused Jokes Bingo! On the card we have:

-A self-depreciating joke about John's appearance
-John is thirsty for another male
-John displays a strong dislike for something mundane (fishes, birds etc.)
-An overly long offtopic monotone story about a minor character of the piece
-""It would be dumb to do something...so we did it!"" 
-A honest commercial that summarizes the whole episode 
-An unfunny celebrity cameo, bonus points for swearing
-An unfunny joke prominently mentions a piece of pop-culture that's currently trending (A ""hello fellow kids"" moment)

"He completely misses the mark, though. The problem is not Data Broker. It is Mass data collection in the first place. It is about not allowing a light app being able to collect your GPS data without providing any user feature that requires it.",13,5
"@Brian Selling the data is not the reason to collect. The reason to collect it is to use it. 
More over, the data that is collected can be breached or leaked, which wouldn't be a problem if it had not been stored in a single database.
And the itens in your amazon chart didn't have to be stored by amazon, It could be stored in your browser. But if you want to give your data away, that is your choice. The problem is the people who are not given the choice not to, or that are not even aware their data is being collected, much less giving their informed consent.",0,
"@Alkis05 If you outlaw the reason to collect the data (the sales of that information), then why would people go out of their way to collect it? Their only use would be for their products and services, and that limits how much they care about what exactly you are doing online. And he DOES address it, because in the start he tells you why that tracking data is actually useful. I LIKE Amazon remembering what's in my cart when I come back. Banning the sale of the info would break down tracking outside of your own site and thus limiting it back down to a reasonable level.",0,

"Hence why he is making an example of his point by creating a User Data Profile that *overwhelmingly* represents the present makeup of congress, and just how easily the data obtained from that as a ""focus group"" can be manipulated with something as ""light-weight"" as an ad.  Presenting the problem in THIS context to the Movers and Shakers of the world is,  unfortunately, the norm.

Legislation on these practices of data-farming protects everyone, but sometimes it takes having the ""elites"" experience discomfort to enact change. This is not a call-to-arms - to destroy all sources of discomfort - nor is it attribution of blame.  Everything from here is up to the people that would feel shame if someone knew they had not just viewed but CLICKED on a graphic about concepts contrary to their job description, like ""voting twice.""  If they DO feel shame, then let's hope it results in laws that respect privacy, rather than more witch-hunts.",0,
"Enforcement is also an issue due to the sheer number of websites, but basically, they're not supposed to be ""opt out"" by default, they're supposed to be 'opt in' by default.    The better ones have 'reject all' as the default option for non necessary cookies, and then you just confirm your selection. 

I will often just leave a website and seek an alternative if the site is being too dodgy about collecting my data.",0,

"When I was in junior high I was writing a (very bad) novel about a woman being a surrogate for a clone and I googled a bunch of what to expect when you're expecting type sites to make it realistic.

I was baffled and my mother was just glad she wasn't a grandma yet and I had graduated HS by then. I think its from the purchase of baby shower gifts for a relative prior.",5,
"There's more to that story. Target determined that if a person bought a pregnancy test AND anti-nausea meds, they were likely pregnant and would send them coupons for baby items. As you note, father was furious that Target would send his high school daughter coupons for baby items, as if encouraging her to have a baby. Of course, she was in fact already pregnant. Target's solution was NOT to stop targeting such coupons, but to add in coupons for lawnmowers or BBQ grills or other items, to make the coupon selection LOOK more random.",17,

"Every era of humanity is named for the thing that both raised civilization to its next level, which inevitably also became its greatest source of death and suffering in that era.  The Iron Age brought infrastructure and farming, but also wars of sword and steel and arrows that killed countless.  The Industrial Age brought production, comfort and the calm of civliized life while also setting us on course for irrevocably ruining the planet's climate, bringing suffering to billions.  The Atomic age revolutionized energy, while the cold war the atom bomb created changed the definition of politics, tribalism, mass fear and mass death forever.  

Now, with internet both bringing us together and changing society in immense ways we could have never foreseen, and bringing wars and genocides we'd never seen, and damaging the mental health of countless others, we are now, truly, in the Information Age.",30,3

"I am embarrassed to say I used to work for one of these companies. Not my proudest moment, but I was also at a low point in my life and desperately needed a change. But I am also proud to say that one of the features I was helping implement was in response to European GDPR and California's CCPA: the right to opt out and be forgotten. They would whine about how expensive it is to implement such things; I helped reduce those costs.

Whatever John says here is spot on -- the groups he is talking about are called ""segments"" (related to market segmentation). These companies know EVERYTHING about you -- while most of the data is ""anonymised"", security and access control are extremely lax. A motivated, savvy employee could easily find out EVERYTHING about your online behavior. 

Here's my advice to protect yourself somewhat -- 
1. Always disable third-party cookies in your browser settings; Use Microsoft Edge or Firefox over Google Chrome.
2. Prefer Apple (iOS) over Google (Android) -- Google's entire business model is based around targeted ads.
3. Do not give permissions to your app to see your location other than when functionally necessary (e.g. when using maps)
4. Opt in to always clear cookies when you exit the browser. This is slightly inconvenient because you may need to sign into your e-mail every time -- but using a password manager (LastPass, 1Password, etc) makes things easier.

Bonus Point:
5. DO NOT SEND YOUR DNA SAMPLES TO 23&ME and other such companies. Your personal health info is guaranteed to be abused.",580,23

"Another point for 5 - your DNA data can be used to find any potential or undetected genetic diseases you may have. That one is especially fucked up, because these companies will sit on that knowledge until you actually get sick and then use it to play targeted ads for medicine against the known symptoms, which can stop you from going to a doctor in time and lead to your death. For example, if your DNA shows a proprensity for breast cancer, you may begin seeing ads for painkillers or heat pads as the pain sets in and not visit a doctor in time to get the tumors removed before the cancer spreads.",21,

Staking is an optional service offered by many vendors. Essentially you can lock up your coins with the vendor to earn interest. The interest earned is denominated by the coin you staked. If you stake bitcoin you will earn a % of bitcoin back. Amount of interest and length or duration of locking up varies wildly. As always the safer routes will offer lower yields and the more riskier ones will offer high yields. Just keep in mind you dont need to stake if you dont want to. It‚Äôs just an optional service. Hope that helps.,0,

The problem with MOST things that people don't understand with data-science is that they are TOO simple.
For example, take a smart-watch that can record ""steps"". This stuff is literal ""magic"" to people. And when you explain that it is just a simple accelerometer that records the  movement of your arm + some simple software that has a record of what an arm swing and the 'shock' of a step at your arm looks like, it ruins that magic.
The same applies to computer vision stuff. I was explaining how a computer vision lane finding system works.

If you're ever in DC and see an ad for like some weird Raytheon weapon system, that's what's happening.

"I have considered doing something similar to this to get Congress to act.  But I am uncertain of the actual legality of it, and whether it would result in way more attention than I have any interest in having.  Basically my idea was to train a machine-learning system on publicly available data about Congress people, from travel records to voting history, etc, and, using prior members of Congress who have been found to be guilty of marital infidelity and similar data points on them, have the system assign a probability score for every member of Congress predicting whether they are cheating on their spouse or not.  Now, I don't personally think a system like that would be likely to actually produce anything worthwhile.  But, I do think it would be similar to the automated systems that the data of Americans is routinely fed through by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and others.  And any time they get busted for collecting peoples data, you will always hear one refrain loud and clear: 'no one is listening to your phonecalls or reading your emails.'  Because, well, they're not.  They're feeding that data into machine learning systems which draw conclusions about you that are probably total bullshit, but they trust the tech so much they would never dare try to actually measure its effectiveness, simply operating on faith.  Would it be illegal to actually create a system that does this?  How about to claim I made one and put out a website with 'scores' for every member of Congress while in actuality I just assigned the scores randomly?

And are you *okay* with giving them that power, especially if they can abuse it?

Generally speaking, if the proposed law or bylaw or whatever gives you an even the slightest sense of malicious satisfaction, and *especially* if the idea of the law being used on *you,* even if that's not what it was originally intended for, gives you even the *slightest* sense of outrage, then that's an excellent indication that it needs to be revised to have more protections in place, or to be less overreaching.

"For John Oliver's chunky showerhead, You will need, one electric butterfly valve, one angled y joint, one reservoir of pulp (artificial snow is the only sanitary option I can think of), an adapter for a reservoir, and waterproof switches and wires. To build this device mod, you will also need a wrench, Teflon tape, and waterproof electrical wire twist caps. screw in butterfly valve with wrench between the reservoir adapter and bendy branch of the y joint( don't glue the reservoir in place if you want to refill it.) You may then wire the valve to a simple switch circuit according to the manufacturers' datasheet. then screw in the showerhead making so that the reservoir of ""pulp"" is above the showerhead for best results( you may need a resistor for the circuit).

I don't really think that's equal. But I do see your point, I am the product.

Yes, I know I can just not use the service(s), but it's getting to the point where you have to just ""pick a poison"" and use a service with bad terms or just start your own email service/hosting service on your own, which does shut out people who are less tech savvy and can get expensive depending on what your needs are.

"As someone who hosts a server I should clarify some things for you.  Everyone who connects to a server has to give that server an IP address.  If you use a router then the router's address is used, but the router itself has to assign an IP address to your browser. All computers must have their own IP address for communication--they talk to each other one at a time.  None of that has anything to do with cookies.  A cookie can have as much or as little information in it as you want--it is just local storage for a server.  And the standard use for a cookie is to save someones username and password for that server.  Otherwise you would have to enter a username and password every time you requested a secure page.  For example, every time you click on a Youtube video the YouTube server checks your YouTube cookie.  So, opting out of cookies does not prevent the server from getting information like your browser type, your OS, or your screen size.  If you can view the web page in more than one size, it already has that information.  Your location information is different and the server has to ask you for that.  Although it might be able to guess with your IP address.  The problem is that it can ask you with any kind of button it wants to--like a yes, no, reply, like, or etc.  So if you are really worried of tracking then use separate browsers for personal information and you can go into preferences and delete your cookies.  Specifically, 3rd party cookies like Thunderjunk mentioned.",2,

"GRAVITY:  (copy and paste from my files):
Here is the test for the 'gravity' portion of my TOE idea.  I do not have the necessary resources to do the test but maybe you or someone else reading this does, will do the test, then tell the world what is found out either way.

a. Imagine a 12 hour clock.
b. Put a magnetic field across from the 3 to 9 o'clock positions.
c. Put an electric field across from the 6 to 12 o'clock positions.
(The magnetic field and electric field would be 90 degrees to each other and should be polarized so as to complement each other.)
d. Direct a high powered laser through the center of the clock at 90 degrees to the em fields.
e. Do this with the em fields on and off.
(The em fields could be varied in size, strength, density and depth.  The intent would be to energy frequency match the laser and em fields for optimal results, cancelling out the em modalities of the laser, thereby leaving behind the gravity modality.)
f. Look for any gravitational / anti-gravitational effects.
(Including the utilization of ferro cells so as to be able to actually see the energy field movements.)
(And note:  if done right, it's possible a mini gravitational black hole might form.  Be ready for it.  In addition, it's possible a neutrino might be formed before the black hole stage, the neutrino being a substance with a very high gravitational modality with very low 'em' modalities.)

(An alternative to the above would be to direct 3 high powered lasers, or a single high powered laser split into 3 beams, each adjustable to achieve the above set up, all focused upon a single point in space.)

'If' effects are noted, 'then' further research could be done.
'If' effects are not noted, 'then' my latest TOE idea is wrong.  But still, we would know what 'gravity' was not, which is still something in the scientific world.  Science still wins either way and moves forward.

*  And note:  Whether my gravity test or another's, a gravitational black hole would have to be formed to prove the concept as being really true.  A gravitational black hole that 'if' self fed itself, could literally wipe out this Earth and all on it, possibly this solar system, possibly put a black hole in this section of our galaxy, and potentially even causing a ripple effect in this galaxy and surrounding universe.  But hey, if it does, no worries.  Nobody would be left to prosecute those who did so.  (Possibly famous last words:  ""Hey, it worked.  Ooooppppssss.................)

But as NASA has already proven that low gravity conditions over a prolonged period of time is harmful to the human species, and large rotating space ships won't really work for space bases on planets and moons, those space bases probably being needed somewhere along the way out of this solar system and galaxy, we need to figure out what gravity truly is and see if we can generate artificial gravity so as to have smaller space ships and proper gravity conditions for space bases on planets and moons.  Otherwise, at least all human life will most probably die and go extinct one day.  Currently, no exceptions.

**  Added note:  Just trying to save at least 1 single species from this Earth to exist beyond this Earth so that life itself from this Earth has continued meaning and purpose to.  Gives me something to do while I exist, otherwise, what is it all and everything for?  Even if my TOE idea were correct, but if it did not help species survive beyond this Earth, what good would it ultimately be?

So, are you feeling lucky?  Doing nothing and at least the entire human species eventually dies and goes extinct with a high degree of certainty.  Doing a gravity test, (mine and/or another's), and there is at least a slim chance of literally wiping out this entire Earth and all on it, and possibly more.  Do you and other's truly want me to prove my TOE idea as being really true?",0,
"LIFE ITSELF IS ULTIMATELY MEANINGLESS IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS.
Ask yourself and try to honestly and sincerely answer:
1.  How exactly do galaxies form?
2.  How exactly do galaxies become spiral shaped?
3.  What exactly does that mean for species that exist in a spiral shaped galaxy?

Current Analysis:  Long Term:  (Short Version):
*  Species stay on this Earth:  They all eventually die and go extinct.
*  Species leave this Earth:  They all eventually die and go extinct.
(No exceptions at this time).

1.  Everybody will die one day from something.
2.  Everybody will forget everything they ever knew and experienced.
3.  Everybody will be forgotten one day in future eternity as if they never ever existed at all in the first place.
(OSICA)

*  Life itself only matters to life itself, only as long as life itself still exists.  It's just that life itself is not always going to exist, at least not from this Earth.  For every moment that passes, one less moment being alive AND one moment closer to being not alive.
(Or so the current analysis would indicate).

Currently:
Nature is our greatest ally in so far as Nature gives us life and a place to live it, AND Nature is also our greatest enemy that is going to take it all away.  (OSICA)

"I learned about this in my computer science classes in college. (Although John Oliver covered some slightly different details and made it more ""real""). This doesn't even get into something called ""proxy data""
Proxy data is data which is used as a stand-in for another piece of data, because it can be used to make a very very very educated guess

For example, either your home address or your Spotify history alone could go a long way toward identifying your race, income level, voting patterns, age, etc. If you combined the two, the ""guess"" would become even more certain and they could figure out even more pieces of data about you, like what clothing stores you're likely to shop at. And if they know your age, race, address, and gender (very basic info) they know what ailments you are more at risk for. Especially because your location may also reveal what restaurants or grocery stores are available around you, the air quality, etc.

I wouldn't be surprised if some or most of these brokers are using AI to find patterns in data which let them ""fill in the gaps"" on an individual's data profile. Because clearly they can get masses of data from people and I think we might be surprised at the reasonable conclusions which can be made from that data.

"@narfle It's important to remember (and I don't think John did a good job of pointing this out, either) that you don't have to have clicked on the ads for the folder to contain your information.

Honestly I think the whole segment, while funny, could have been handled better. The Internet tracks you, even if you don't click on dumb funny ads, and de-anonymizing users isn't a thing that happens because the user was careless.

"It's worse than that. At first you get a discount for using the app. Then they raise rates, so effectively it's a service charge for app-refusers.

"I've been studying this type of data harvesting for work purposes for years and it's so much worse than you can possibly imagine.  Let me give you an example.  Look at the back of a sporting event ticket and you'll notice something that says, by entering this area, your image and likeness may be used.  Most people think It's because they may end up on TV or the jumbotron, it's not.  They are literally tracking your face and phone ID from the moment you walk through those metal detectors and harvesting data about what you're doing in the stadium just like John is talking about.  They then take that data and your picture and scrub social media for something you posted at the event and now they have your social media handle too. Bought a jersey at the game?  Now you‚Äôre going to get targeted ads on your Facebook and Instagram feeds for more sporting apparel. Another example, when you stand next to a sign at the mall looking at a store directory, your phone ID is captured by an internal tracking beacon inside the display and they are tracking every store you're interacting with.  That same company that owns the mall is now tracking you at every property you visit that they own.  Use the ""free"" Wifi?  Yup, you guessed it.  They've got even more data about you.  At this point, I don't know what can be done to solve this problem.",16,1
"Something similar along this vein: casinos. I've had people saying they don't use their membership cards because ""they can track how much you spend then."" The surprised look on their faces when I told them they don't need your card for that were pure gold. Most people have no clue about facial recognition and how it's being used for years already. ""But how do they know it's me? They only have my face, not my name."" And what about that ID card, driver's license or passport you had to show at the entrance? That contains biometric data, easy peasy linking that to the facial recognition software and just tracking you from camera to camera, from the slot machines to the roulette table. Just read out the logs of those machines at the time you were playing them and voila, they know exactly what you've won and lost, no cards needed. Tables is just a matter of playing back the right camera at the right time to see the croupier taking the money from you and exchanging it.

About a week later, the news crew showed up at the houses of the people they had contacted. They sat the entire family down in the living room, including ones they had never seen before. 
The news crew went around the name and gave everyone's name, date of birth, current occupation, favorite foods, favorite colors, and favorite entertainment artists. They even had the prescriptions they were taking and details on their private medical histories.

"@Apollo I did Google Socialism.  In fact, I gave you the No. 1 Google definition of Socialism in my earlier reply.

You're trying to mesh political ideology with economic policy; a lot of people do that, especially in the modern world where the two seem inseparable.  As a matter of practicality, it may not be possible to separate them anymore.  As a matter of academia, however, they are.

As a matter of academia, China is a Communist state.  There are no democratic elections.  The government controls or regulates all means of production and distribution.  There is no free press.  There is no protected right to congregate or petition without reprisal.  There is no freedom of religion (just ask the Uigurs).  The government controls and regulates all forms of communications, from television and telephone, to internet access.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  This is Communism, not Socialism.  Just as was the case in Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany, China's government controls every aspect of personal, political, and business interaction.

Further, as a matter of economic policy, China attempts to practice Capitalism, but fails miserably.  There is no free market in China; the government controls the market.  There is no competition for market share - the government allows or disallows certain commercial competitors in each market space based on what it believes will be the most advantageous or productive.  China constantly manipulates the value of its currency on the open market.

To the outside world, it may seem like China is a capitalist economy because their goods and services compete reasonably well with other countries on the world market.",0,

there is no exact definition for socialism. and what you call the government in socialism is actually the people = society. 
already in the 1920s some guy tried to define socialism and found out that there were more than 200 different definitions. 

and you don't actually believe that in a truly socialist country there could ever be a wealth gap as we see in China. China is a dictatorian regime with communist elemets that are mainly for show and a highly capitalist economy. It can therefore - if done seriously and not by buzzfeed - not be classified as communist/socialist or whatever.",3,
"@Glenn Pearson I am well aware of this but look into how that would be enforced. Study socialism more. I am far from a capitalism advocate, but I see no better alternative besides strict regulations and making the rich actually pay taxes. Capitalism has too much of a hold on western society already.

@snare it is 100% authoritarian with socialist and (some) capitalist elements. It can be described and has been many times. It is definitely not left leaning in anyway besides economically.

"@Apollo I am sorry, but I totally disagree. China is China and cannot be classified in any way. It certainly has socialist elements, it has very strong capitalist elements and it has dominant authoritarian elements. There is no word for Chinas economic/political system or at least I havent heard of it yet. 
But most importantly China has pretty much no democratic elements whatsoever and can already because of that not be classified as (dominantly) socialist at all.

but yes it is problematic when the state has too much power. but in my opinion that is only a problem if the democratic elements are not strong enough.

The concept of ""socialism"" and ""giving the state control"" are complete and utter opposites.  The word itself is your first clue:  SOCIALism.

Here is the textbook definition of Socialism:

(noun) - a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.

It's not just about cookie policies and trackers. It's also about where our data is being hosted geographically. As it stands, Europe has no reason to trust US companies will honor GDPR in any capacity. It's currently being debated whether our public institutions should even use services like AWS, Azure, etc. because it goes completely against GDPR and is, technically speaking, illegal. But our systems are so entangled at this point. So we need the US to catch up and do better in terms of privacy and data protection.

"@The Inquiry - It IS reality, to the extent that it applies to access BY THE GOVERNMENT to those things. The first 10 amendments to the Constitution, aka The Bill of Rights, define the rights of Americans in relation to their government.  People tend to think that it applies across the board, both to gov't and private entities. it doesn't. The people collecting and trading in your data on the internet are nominally private citizens or businesses. John does refer to the government going through these third parties to obtain data, and I believe (not sure on the current status) that the legality of doing this is up in the air, and therefore permissible until ruled otherwise.  The law as relates to this new digital technology is presently the Wild West - it remains to be hashed out and codified. And I wouldn't hold my breath on how quickly that will happen.  I mean, we're still thrashing out elements of the second amendment as relates to the right to bear arms, and that technology is older than our country, it has simply advanced over time.

But anyway, the 4th amendment limits government actions.  Not those of private entities.  If someone breaks into your house and steals property or papers, they can't be prosecuted under the fourth amendment, either, unless they are acting as agents of the government.  And government officials can currently argue that they are not stealing anyone's private data, they are purchasing a commodity available to anyone through a legitimate business.

Also, let's not forget that this data has presumably been collected through original sources that have obtained the owner's permission to access and use it.  Which goes to John's comments on how labyrinthine internet websites make our ability to restrict their use of cookies and their ability to access certain personal data.  Until laws are promulgated that restrict these wide-open fishing expeditions by private industry or individuals that are forbidden to our government, it is what it is.

Aren't my constant actions and decisions constantly producing its value, and therefore may I not have a claim to at least a portion of it? At the very least I think this is something that could be revisited in courts. Your proposed solution is again in the liberal-libertarian side: empower the individual to protect themselves against the corporations, but most individuals won't be capable enough to do so effectively, as always.

"To be clear, I think what these goons are doing is terrible and wrong, and we need to do something about it...but the argument you're using has already been tested in courts, and hasn't held up. The problem with it boils down to the fact that facts/information/data themselves are not what is being sold ‚Äî indeed they cannot be 'owned' in the first place. The collection, processing and transmission of data itself is the real thing of value.

It's easiest to show by analogy:
Consider if I walked around a busy downtown area with a clipboard, writing down the brands, styles, colors &c. of clothing people were wearing while walking by. Then, after doing this all day, I took that information, compiled it into a statistical report, and sold it to a clothing company that'd use the data to determine what products to make or not.

In such a case, the information about what people were wearing is not itself the thing of value in the transaction. Rather, the time and work I put into observing that data, writing it down, compiling it into a report, doing computations &c. are. I alone created that value ‚Äî the actual facts about what people were wearing are just that; ownerless facts about the world.

Ultimately online data is the same. The salable asset is not the information itself, but the work/expense put into running the servers, writing the code, &c. for the collection, compilation and aggregation of that information. Users are not the ones creating that value: these companies are, so no, the user themselves does not own it. Changing that by making information itself an ownable asset would have disasterous unintended consequences.

Methinks what we really need is reform of copyright law, and specifically requiring vendors to allow consumers the right to modify their devices and software. They could then simply remove the tracking code if they so choose; at current, it's literally a crime to do so. I'll elaborate if you want, but this is already quite a wall of text :p",0,

Recently, the EU has made changes to implement opt-in as the baseline, but even then you still have ""legitimate interests"" active by default, so again, you have to click, click, click your way into privacy, and some cookie providers don't even give the option to turn these off at all.",123,7

I know its a pain in the ass to fact check, but that's your choice and your problem if only want to ask questions and cast judgment on news segments without actually finishing them before drawing conclusions.

It gathers some information about you (information that never leaves Google) and then offers targeted ad space. Google gets paid by these advertising companies and then channels around 70% of the money to the site owners, Youtube creators and other content creators. 

In other words, without Google being able to convince ad companies that it will display their ads to people in a specified demographic, a lot of the internet would cease to function.

I really don't know what the best way around this is. On the one hand we want information to be freely available for people who don't have enough money to buy it. On the other hand we worry about our information falling into the wrong hands. I really think Google may be the best solution.",0,

VPNs are wholly unnecessary if you can't be sure they're more reputable than your ISP (and in most cases, they are not) and you stick with TLS-encrypted traffic. You can be more paranoid than that, but then using the internet would become very unpleasant.",2,
"Interesting thing, even if you‚Äôre not seeing them, the biggest actors in the advertising industry are pretty good at picking out people using adblockers because why spend money to show an advert, if you know the person isn‚Äôt going to see it? People leak data all over the place, and when you give a significant incentive to advertisers to avoid you (like, wasting their money), then they get pretty inventive finding ways to quickly reidentify you, so as to avoid that loss. (This is usually just normal demographic analysis after all.)

VPNs are only useful if you‚Äôre using them regularly. Just a slip up or two can quickly deanonymize you to anyone with the resources and will to track you down e.g. your government, if they believe you‚Äôve committed a serious crime.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible to deanonymize yourself, if you practice an extreme amount of privacy hygiene, but I‚Äôve become pretty nihilistic about it all after working in the industry.

I start looking up music a lot more recently, and I get ads for tools. Even though when I was looking for a new toolset a couple years ago, I never got those ads. Make it make sense.",2,

"Brave browser is nice. Works just like chrome. Made to be super private, ad free - UNLESS you choose to have it pay you to view discreet non-targeted and fairly rare ads (I've made maybe $100 in maybe 18 months, a nice surprise when I remember it's there).",0,

That's what free VPN's do, use a reputable paid service and you should be fine.",5,
"Moreover, ISPs can still see your data when using VPNs.",4,
"Most VPNs are owned by the same few companies, and they do sell your data. You're essentially undoing your progress by using them.",10,
@SaintAlia_of_the_Games It's not like you get more ad banners. The amount probably stays the same. It's just that the ads that were already there are now more targeted.,2,
"@speedfastman If you browse the internet without any blockers or trackers, depending on your region and sites you visit, 'bombarded' is VERY apt.",32,
