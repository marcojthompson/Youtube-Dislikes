ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE    If he listened to his wife and close his YT channel  and not reopen it  he would have not been fired from Google and still have his wife and kid,1,1
Millionaire special  I came for some millionaire inspiration lol    That s typical Asians that likes branded name title and companies   Friends  don t like you doing so much better than them  Good that you have no friends   ,1,1
 For me  being a TechLead is to leave people alone  let them lead themselves  ,5,1
You should change the channel name  As a millionare TV,1,1
Never trust a woman who won t support your activity that makes you a better and fulfilled person  Never ever even if she s 11 10,1,1
ok   how do you manage your sexual life now   and how did you manage your sexual needs throughout your life as a millionare,1,1
I recently came across your channel and I like your videos   Your videos are simple and engaging   I am still trying to figure out how you attracted so many subscribers   I am not saying this to criticize you but to say that I am interested in learning what causes people to follow some and dismiss others   Keep going  the videos are great  ,1,1
im 26 and your videos are funny and serious at the same time   i think im addicted to them   Great advice btw ,1,1
1 41 you were doing it for the  gram,1,1

Techlead has a son to whom he can pass on his wealth and doesn t even have to raise him  Win win,1,1
gratz,1,1
A millionaire means you earn at least a million a year  Net worth   1million isn t enough for that title ,1,1
Congrats  ,3,1
A good wife would encourage  inspire  and support her husband in all that he does and pursues  Haters are gonna hate   I wonder if she watches all your videos    At the very least  she gave you a beautiful son  Congrats on 1M subs    ,1,1

6 56 I ve been in a very similar position pretty much my whole life  I could manage to scrape a C or B grade without revising in Computer Science and Maths and figured  What s the point in trying hard if I m not failing   But a couple weeks ago I had this same thought   I wonder what I could manage if I actually did try  Long story short I got my first A   or A    and shocked myself  Hearing the fact you had the same thought process and it pushed onto the road you are on today  has given me a sense of scale of how a couple hours here and there can translate into the real world  Thank you ,1,1
He seems such a nice guy and then he starts saying how he doesn t have friends and that they are all losers and toxic        ,14,3
Because many people are toxic ,2,

Can you do a video on the  craftsmanship movement in software engineering  Seem like would delay releases ,1,1
congeats 1million subs   wohoo,1,1
A good friend does want you to succeed EVEN IF you  one up  them  A good parent wants their child to have a relationship with the other parent EVEN IF their own marriage stopped working  I feel like the tech community have some very visible shortage in Emotional Intelligence and Maturity   This was also noticeable in the HBO series Silicon Valley   And Good Will Hunting comes to mind  where the main character liked his  dumb  friends because they were like family ,1,1
Yeeaaaah we know   how u scammed people   ,1,1
The title gets me every time lmaoo,1,1
I love you,2,1

Hey TechLead  I hope you are going to find a new love again  That s the best thing a man can do when your ex wife is not there anymore to support you  Or get a dog or a cat  P   Congratz on your 1 million  I followed you when you had 10k to 100k subs    ,1,1

Breaking News     Tech Lead Gets His Revenge   Our leading story today is about a man who co founded the new Facebook Google Hub  Yes folks it s now more popular than Facebook and Google  They said it couldn t be done but he did it   Sometimes an idea who s time has come    Can not be stopped   I built a static beta web project several years ago when I worked for a tech company as a web developer back in Texas  I submitted it to ycombinator but didn t make the cut because I only knew front end code and the site was static for demo  I also offered it to Google but didn t receive a response  It sat on the shelf after that  I changed the domain name and redesigned the format but I didn t follow through for a second round of attempts  I registered a new and better domain a few weeks ago and I m considering building a functioning site and learning backend to possibly resubmit it to ycomb  Idk yet  I will send you  Yes  another one of those    This is the next Facebook offers  lol  It s quite possible that it may peak your interest   Thanks  James  Rescue Kitty    Snowvan ,1,1
holy  he is a million  fake it till u make it,1,1

Bad worse worst ugly annoying dumb garbage badly bad bad bad bad bad  Here YouTube i hope the sentiment analysis can stop showing me this channel that give me no value ,1,1
TechLead I ve been following your content for years and greatly enjoy most of it  but I think you are making a big mistake   you don t utilize the fact that you are a Millionaire enough  You probably didn t notice but people automatically give more credit for those who claim they are millionaires  regardless of how they made it or if it s actually true   cough  trump  cough    I know this because I m a future googoler ,1,1
This man is talented because he doesn t really sell anything but his sponsor and talk about life for dozens of videos ,6,1

Don t be fooled by TechBoy s  adbucted child  sob story  It s obviously not simple  or legal  for a parent to take a child out of the country without the other legal guardian s approval  There s so much he s not telling us ,1,1
Don t be motivated by the money  be motivated by your goals and passions   ,8,2

Congrats to my Youtube mentor  millionaire techlead   Funny that we have the same success topic video this week     We  as INTJ  are so similar in the execution part  I just need to be a techlead someday  ,5,1
After the Biden capital gains  43  for people who make 1 million or more and income tax rates go up  Tech Lead will be motivated more than ever to make more money ,1,1
congrats on the 1M sub   ,1,1
I think its just your perception that there are many haters  Its just that possibly you are concentrating on them a lot  Look at the likes to dislikes ratio that you have on youtube  its over99  likes  In no way everyone hates you  This is the problem with internet  even one hate comment in 100 can feel like everyone is hating you  We all like Techlead i e more than 99  of your viewers  D,1,1
Congrats you deserve it and thanks for the awesome content ,2,1
Hang in there  it s very common that teenage children overwhelm a single mother and move in with the father  who can be just as loving as the mother  but is strong enough to provide structure and discipline as well  Your kid is almost assuredly going to live with you at some point ,2,1
What a milestone  congrats ,2,1
I knew he would make this video  There s just no way he wouldn t XD,5,2
 I tend to not seek social status   as a millionaire   CLASSIC  ,6,1
Congratulations for 1Million subs       ,3,1
cheers,2,1
I think it s pretty presumptuous to say that you ve made enough money  How does anyone know that  Compared to most other people  sure  you re ahead  But what if a problem comes along that makes that amount of money pale in comparison  What if you just worked harder  you could ve financially handled it  Life can be pretty fickle  All you can really do is earn and learn as much as you can while being as happy as you can  No reason to stop hustling unless your will to live is withering away ,1,1
Congratulation       You must have put in so much effort in here channel which I can t even imagine           and      All my doctors said I can t work  so that I m trying to work hard   and also my dad forces me to do so    ,1,0
I m on reddit  I don t hate you   I m benevolently indifferent ,1,1
If your channel has so little worth why do so many people like it  That s implying that non of our opinions matter  but I ve seen very intelligent comments here  and on YT channels in general  All of the people telling you to shut it down were trying to make you into their version of you  instead of supporting you in being yourself  It isn t like you did YT while neglecting your tech job  They probably meant well  but their  help  was not required or appropriate to the situation in which it was offered  imo ,1,1
Congratulations techlead sama uwu,1,1
Congrats bossman   Prosper,1,1
Skips out on friendships  I skip that step  as well ,1,1

Congratulations ,1,0
Thanks    For mentioning you re against micromanagement  This happened to me in my last job  and never before  In all my previous jobs I had  free hands  to deliver  And now I had people with less professional knowledge  lead  me in my field  They didn t only tell me what to do   but also all the intermediate steps  like what route I need to take  So frustrating and not creative   I am a data scientist    And yes  everyone telling you about how to live your life  I understand that for you working inside those companies you see the reality of it  while your relatives  are still flashed with the image  and not letting you find your own way to happiness   I am sure you feel inside of you what is the right way  Btw  I was also fired from my last company  an overrated corporation  that pays most people sub market salaries  while expecting you to grind 24 7   And yes  my workday had too many meetings  sometimes it started with zero meetings  that turned into 3 meetings on a short notice  was expected to answer e mails etc  It s just scientifically proven that multi tasking is counter productive  In my case  it drains me faster   And yes  congrats   I think you re a very grounded person  being aware of what the world is like and where to realize opportunities    I love your wit  honesty  precision and down to grownd edness   I hope one day you will know what to do with the money and that you will be able to enjoy life with someone worthy of you  and trust worthy   What would motivate me to continue working  interesting challenging exciting work  That ,1,1

Woa congrats you and your channel  ,1,1
I just want to give you a big hug  3,1,1
It s always amazing when people close to you   think it s better to work under the boot of someone else  rather than make more working for yourself  Probably just so they can tell everyone they know about your prestigious  job   Tell your ex if she brings your son back  you might stop mentioning her on the channel   It s insane she disappeared with him in the first place  Just plain cruel and evil ,1,1
I kind of find this guy annoying but want him to win a Nobel Prize of some sort in the same time for just being who he is  Sure  Nobel Prize might be under his league but still    1M sub  well done sir ,1,1

I have been listening to Dr  Jordan Peterson on youtube and also just start reading his latest book  It inspires me a lot  He said something similar to what you did  It s that you work really hard on something  and see what happens ,2,1
the 1 million looks good great achievement well done Patrick  Whenever i go into my office  every Monday i get an email saying the group meeting with the TechLead starts at 10 am  it feels weird because in my mind there is only one TechLead  i cant understand why there are so many imposters    ,6,0
I get that being a Youtuber is not as prestigious but it s still an awesome way to make money as opposed to wagecucking for big corp  Although I should probably say not as prestigious in the eyes of traditional people  like most Asians   Zoomers on the other hand seem to be pretty obsessed with influencers and social media ,1,0

This guy humble brag is so humble  Obsessed with his videos lol  I ve been watching them all,15,1
He refers to people on Reddit who hate him  and I ve seen it  The thing they don t understand is that the humble brag is his schtick  It wouldn t be the same if he wasn t talking about his income in a frank manner  That it goes over their heads just shows what humorless drones infest Reddit ,4,

Congratulations Patrick ,1,3
I kind of disagree with this idea that people that advise you to get a regular job are all haters  Especially the ones that care for you  close friends or family  They might actually want the best for you  The only difference being that their  best  is different than your  best   And they just don t know any better ,1,1
  I don t need much at all  I just wanna some Playstation  play games  and live at home with my parents  play with my dog occasionally     TechLead  a multimillionaire,3,3
Despite the circumstances you still make effort to be in your kid s life  You re a great father  TechLead   Cheers to many more millions so you can continue to see your son    ,35,7
 stoco you are on the right side or maybe not,1,
 Qurdi Sanchez Moises I wasn t talking about him  i m just saying people in general,1,
I concur with you  I hope the  TechLead ending up with an OUTSTANDING woman in his life  We cannot enjoy life to its fullness alone    I feel that I am missing out when I am not with my lovely wife and daughter    ,2,
Now you re a  double millionaire    WELL DONE    I was hoping you would have a t shirt with  TechLead   a multimillionaire    Ahh  no wait   your ex wife would like to get a chunk of that long built splendid cake  ,2,3
 Many books are long drawn out  keep beating a dead horse to get a point across  I can totally attest to this and is one of the reasons I don t read books that often tbh  In the end you are likely to only retain like 10  of the content after a while and use about 5  of that if at all  in general  anyway  I m not talking about applicable books like technical  scientific or recipe books etc ,2,3
i m starting to think he s really insecure ,1,3
No friend gang   ,2,1
Why don t you take your son with yourself ,1,1

Some of my friends are successful senior software devs  I don t relate to his description of the  toxic friend who wants to see you fail   The people that this guy describes sound horrible  maybe that s what it s like in California   Silicon Valley  America  Or maybe it s just that this guy s cynical personality attracts these kinds of people ,1,1
That story about ex wife stealing your kid is the funniest moment on YouTube ever,5,1
The real question here is  do we live in a simulation ,2,1

Right now  my aim is to reach that point in life where I don t have to calculate while shopping at a store  You inspire me  Techlead ,122,29
ironically you calculate more the more money you have ,2,
 Patrick Gono wow so touching and emotional,1,
Even a Forex trader that makes more than a dropshipper calculate always,1,
When I was a student I would buy groceries based on what was on sale or discounted  I loved the  nearly expired  box in which you could find meat and dairy with same day expiry dates  usually 50  off  I was thinking   oh man  can t wait to earn good money so that I can go grocery shopping and not look at the price tags  just buy what I feel like    Then I found a decent job  and had enough money to comfortably cover any regular living expenses  Yet I still was on the lookout for discounts when buying groceries  and most of the things I bought were the  supermarket brand   instead of the big named ones  I was like 25 when I realized that I am actually an adult with plenty of money  and I can just buy whatever I feel like  For a long time I wasn t explicitly aware of this   Now I have an even better job  and it seems money won t be an issue any time soon  Nevertheless  I still shop like a poor person  I rationalize it by how efficient it is  how little food waste I produce  that I eat less meat and dairy  and in this way contribute to the environment and animal welfare  that I keep my spending low so as not to inflate my standard of living  But deep down I am starting to realize I am just a cheap bastard  Habit is a shirt of iron  as they say ,14,
Calculating is always good,2,
You ll always be calculating buddy if it s not for shopping it ll be for something else,10,
   and also give back,3,

 Milan i think i am cooler than the techlead,1,
All that is left for us to do is to keep liking and giving away our time to The TechLead by watching his videos for the rest of our lives ,1,
 Sanyu Tumusiime As he stated once before  it s not a matter of how hard you try  you have to be BORN as the TechLead or whomever you are trying to embody in life ,2,
As a thousandaire budding YouTuber with 20 subscribers  this is a powerful message  Keep hustling people  Don t stop ,54,3

 Ameen Sha C I also decided not to pursue the CS program  Berkeley s CS program is cutthroat  If you didn t make it into the school for EECS  it was very difficult to get into the CS program  This was also during the time when the demand for CS was uncertain  and there were no YouTube videos where you can just learn this stuff ,1,
 Jorge Smith heck  he was probably the guy who always asked  isn t our take home midterm due today  right when class was letting out ,3,
 Danilo Alves based on his Berkeley transcript  we took CS61a together  However I did not know him  He was probably the kid that yelled  Yes   after being the first one to complete the midterm final exam as he exited the auditorium ,11,
