So you mean it is already saturated ,1,
 rubbercable  Eh  understandable   This hearing those words in this context honestly makes me cringe inside too  even if only a little  I wish you well  dude    ,2,
 Ivory AS I was referring to the video being negative  It s been a tough 6 years  Guess I m a bit touchy  Words like woke and communism triggered me ,1,
 Rama Gakii cool  can you tell us how did you make it ,2,
 Raven Echo am coming,1,
Hell with this guy  I want to know everything ,1,
Kinda sus youre ex company engineer,1,
 Elena Thanks Kat,1,
 Rama Gakii woooo congratulations that s amazing,1,
You must hack GOOGLE,1,
He s saying even though there may be other forms of competition holding you back such as AI or small minded people if you are going to learn to program it won t be all magic success stories  Personally I was struggling just to decide on a language and a ide I could learn with  Some are too much to start with  So all that takes time the right language and a tool the doesn t make you feel too stupid  Now I have made two decisions easier  The other thing he is saying continue if that is what you want to do even if it s on the side in your spare time don t quit the job that pays your bills  while you get established  Also find a real reason why you want to program  Being a programmer is a under appreciated job  Do it because you want to ,3,
Dude this course is way more valuable than any guru tai Lopez crypto course out there,1,
You say working a braindead 60k job in a dusty room full of computers and nerds like its a bad thing when I m used to working a job entailing back breaking physical labor for less than 30k a year  I m like  sign me up ,5,
This dude is funny   I love his videos ,1,
So if you are telling us not to learn coding why are you training others ,9,
Doomer   Funny Doomer  but a doomer nonetheless ,1,
Do you offer tips on how to get a job surrounded by beautiful women ,1,
Thanks  just the video I needed  I can be a nerd  but a hearth I am more business minded the results   use case is the main atttractions    If I may ask or other may answer  probably  for learning to develop in low code with some space for alteration  is javascript suffiencent with some knoweledge on front en back end packedges  or is python or other language a better option to have some basic undnerstanding ,1,
 techlead Are you in Hawaii  ,1,
I have never thought about doing programming as a job  rather a skill to use for other things  I aspire to become a mechanical engineer when I am 26  I am 14 now so that gives me time ,9,
 Rama Gakii ayy  do some charity and give me a job ,3,
With this video   he gave us no good reason to join this training ,29,
Hey techlead  I want to be like you,3,
nice,1,
thanks for making me a millionaire in my country Kenya   am now worth over 110 000 dollars that s over 12 million Kenyan shillings,12,
congratulations  you just crushed my dream through and through  still  i don t regret watching this video ,1,2
i totally liked the video   highly enjoyable chat  TechLead is a wise funny young man ,1,2
Why should I not learn to code   Him  I WANNA FEEL SPECIAL,1,1
yeah that area is expensive  itd be nice if your family could be convinced to move to a rural area and save out with you,1,2
Thank you for putting the relatable show for us ,1,0
Imposter syndrome eats away at you and the time investment to master a codebase hurts your relationships with those closest to you ,1,0
Glad we have a whistle blower on this topic   Coding for the life of me has been a thorn on my side ,1,0
I was learning dart but after this video i closed vscode and stopped and this video frightened me in a way that all the work and hardship i do in this market of tech are already wasted even you dont know yet it was ,1,1
Feedback appreciated hit me up   for advice and guidance,1,
Maybe I just kill myself ,1,1
Sorry but I can t see machine learning doing what you say it is doing  I think that applies only if you code decision engines  I see a lot of creativity needed instead to stitch together various techs and libraries  that is true  I would say the emphasis now is more on architecture than coding itself and I am so down for that  Develop the ability to create patterns and macro algorithms  don t focus only on coding ,1,1
 dont learn programming you will earn 70k  thats good money    ,1,0
Depressing  bubble bursting  and dream shattering ,1,0
Very very intelligent guy  An amazing internet character  I love hate him ,1,0
School constantly reminded us that coding isn t glamours  especially coders that code video games   We had a person from EA come over and basically told us if you go that direction  you ll have to sacrifice having a stable family  and a social life because of the deadlines   Don t think I ever heard a Swede glorify coding ,3,2
Bullshit 500k,2,0
So no need for programmers ,1,0
I just hate how all the schools and colleges in my area praise this software company have them talk come to events   they have internships and programming clubs  yet no one talks about how they fired 100 employees for cheaper programmers in Poland  It feels like all a facade  Then they have university professors coming do talks about problem solving and how you need to be an obsessive 100iq out of the box thinker to stand out  Bro  I spent 4 years repeating whatever the teacher said to me in highschool ,2,1
Usually do the opposite of what successful people say out loud lol,1,0
Damn  this is discouraging now lol  Just started coding  Great ,1,1
Knowing how to code is invaluable because you can always leverage that skill to have a major impact on the internet  All it takes is the right idea or problem you solve ,7,0
You have a lot of great content  but your comments regarding diversity are so stereotypical and just out right off base  as if being Black or Latino will give you a free pass  That never happened for me because I have had to work for every inch of ground that I accomplished  and this is coming from a guy with two masters degrees  You seem to be confused about diversity initiatives meant to address exclusionary practices that disadvantaged my people and minorities for generations  Your content is too good for you to be interjecting inaccurate diversity quips ,1,1
You are a funny dood hahaha    ,1,1

dang asian and white alike for diversity efforts lol,1,1
Remarkable video and channel,1,1
Great Video TechLead     You have a great sense of humor  I lived your dream     love it    I think your experience and advice is very realistic and people would be wise to watch this before choosing their path   and yes I agree it is best to combine coding with creative and marketing and or other skills ,1,0

Brutal comedy but spot one ,1,1
 I will forever be in depted to you    you ve changed my life I ll continue to preach about your name for the world to hear    you ve saved me from a huge financial debt with just little investment  Thanks Mercy Greg ,42,7
You can Reach her on   Te Ie gr am   with the name below   Mercy Greg,4,
That was an important take for me to hear since I consider to become a software engineer   The thing I don t really get is that you say coding is a brain dead skill nowadays on the one hand and on the other hand you say being a senior software engineer is like being a master piano player in an orchestra  So do you mean its easy or is it hard  Or are you saying its hard to become a senior software engineer and from there on work is boring and easy  And by the way I know that depends on the person   ,2,0
So I am probably not like most of you here  I have just figured out how to make a glider gun in the game of life  I am not a number witch person  Having said that I think this video is a window to the future  I am a musician and a photographer and a trucker  Like every other skill   except maybe horse shoeing  which I have done   computers are having an impact  I can now do things with my phone that would have taken me hours  used all manor of chemicals and a room full of equipment  The things that took years to learn can now be side steped  The world is going this way  not bad  When will we replace expensive  bias and corruptible politicians with AI ,1,0
Beats English teaching in Asia,1,0
Thanks for this video  I ve been getting into programming the past few months and have found it stimulating so far  but I also considered that it is so commonly advised to  learn to code   My expectation in life is that usually  by the time you ve heard something is a good idea or a good industry to get into  you ve missed the bus  You have to proactively anticipate a growing sector or industry  That doesn t take oracular powers  it doesn t take much research to learn about something years ahead of 99  of the population  but it does mean that it won t be something you just  hear about  offhandedly   That said  the video did confirm that the direction I want to take my programming education is right  and that I should keep learning regardless of my ultimate career ,2,0
Lmfao For how soft you talk  it s addictive listening to you  Love your videos ,1,0
When programming is dying  why you sell  Learn the real secrets to pass the tech interview    ,1,0
A swift kick to the balls would be a great finally to this video ,1,0
Short answer  software engineering has become far too oversaturated and with the advent of machine learning algorithms you not only have many more humans to compete against  but also now the machine itself is able to efficiently create code flow that negates the need for higher level assistance from outside operators   The prototypical software dev that is portrayed in Hollywood productions is outdated by about a decade  The glory days are over ,6,2
Do what you want people  Life is hard  and anything you start brand new you re probably going to suck hard at  If it s worth it  it will be  And then you ll die  Peace ,2,0
How can incentivizing a group that has been ignored  disincentive a group that s already at the table  Humans are treacherous ,1,0
Im sorry I dont like how you literally demotivated us who aspire to be programmers  I respect that you are a high class programmer with entepreneur domain something but you don t literally have the rights to give demotivation for those who wants to programers because your a programmer too  Me  I dont want to program for money   I want to program because I love each and every concept of coding   I dont care if I wasnt able to understand immediately and I dont care how hard it is but Im happy on what Im doing and that whats only matters  ,1,0
I laughed so hard I almost spit out my drink    THIS PART   You kind of thought that we were on the same level  I look normal  so you think I m relatable but that s a show I put on for you guys just so you watch me but in reality  I m pretty up there  I m pretty up there          I have no idea who this guy is nor do I have any interest in coding but I watched the video because I have kids so I was curious based on the video title  But these lines alone got him a like  Pure gold   ,1,1
The value statement of programming has always been business  Steve Jobs didnt write code  Bill Gates did not get rich writing code  no app start up has ever failed or succeeded because of code  It s design from the very beginning that made programming valuable  Optimization is a endlessly complicated task that represents most of what you are talking about when it comes to  real programming    but none of it mattered to anything but a business bottom line  It was always about people  and the way you reach the most people is buy understanding them and where they come from    Just because you can solve hard problems that have been solved before  does not mean you have the perspective neccesary to solve to most pressing problems we have in society today    Learn to code to solve social problems  not code for coding s sake and you will make money at it ,6,1
technology does not solve social problems  it creates them,2,
I remember when 5 hour energy drink came into my company  It was a new product  and I was like this will never sell  But the people who started it just knew   Now I understand the mindset  Chris  I have drawn up the plans for an App  that will make billions  I watch the movie the social network and it has me terrified in trusting anybody with my project  I believe deeply in trust and loyalty  and I already know my App  will work because i did a small part of it and in 2 years over 8 hundred thousand people came to my page  but I was using someone else App  who shut me down   All i need is a trustworthy and loyal person who want to be a billionaire  Do you know such a person  We need to talk ,1,0
60k salary in a musty office sounds good to me lol,1,0

what if im already a big tech nerd is there a better career path ,1,1
Remember don t be programmer because money   but be programmer if you want to be problem solver ,1,0

Man I cant thank you enough for this    Felt late to the party anyway and just want to understand more for my own knowledge in the crypto space  Will continue to learn and you earned mad respect from me for how you simplified so many questions I didnt even know I had in just 12 min    Stay cool brotha and will be following you in the future and rooting for you ,7,1
really glad i didn t listen to this guy   coding is great   ignore this and have fun ,1,1
as machine s become smarter and do everything for us  we all become dumber ,2,0
 600k a year senior software developer   The dream job  Yep that was me I was living your dream  why am I being flexed on like this  What did I do to u ,2,0
Reality check boys  I m glad I watched this got caught up coding when my real focus is robotics and cyber security,2,0
thanks for the honest approach  Hope you are fine tech lead  it is very insulting that the most skilled people can be excluded just because they are white or asian  hope you and your family are well  and that you continue your successful life ,1,0
Could you be any snottier ,1,0
Such a positive guy ,1,0
My take away from this video is  do a career that is tech immune  Meaning  use tech as a tool and not a career  If you don t want to be obsolete  do something essential  COVID has taught us that ,2,1
How does this video only have 43K likes    This is some good stew to chew   As a philosopher and IT geek  I enjoyed this video which distilled the savant level knowledge and intelligence lifestyle of coders with an understanding of passion  and its distinction from hobbycraft  and career choices ,1,0
Bro got up on the wrong side of the bed and decided to make this video XD,1,0
Thank you very much for the video  I had one of those epiphany moments and got all inspired regarding a coding programming path in life  I wanted to test the sobriety of that moment and the feelings it produced and told myself I d do some minimal research for a week or two  I like your videos and actually remember watching you before for some life advice and perspective so it was fun to realize I was making a return visit  I tried the Navy  and Pharmacy as towo larger than normal life decisions prior and there s something about coding that feels like it could be up my alley  As my heart was never in the prior paths   That being said  I m watching videos and looking around like I said to test the sobriety of that feeling and wanting to maintain my humility and clarity of thought   I ve no rush or impatience and simply want to see how I would make this happen if I follow my whimsy  My idea would be to work part time full time and study part time until I could make my own projects and get to what I feel is an  apprentice  level and continue from there   I do wonder about what you said about job market and competition  The state of affairs in the world and politics  etc   I have no strong statements or anything to make  This is more of a thank you letter  For me  this adds some cold calculation and shows reflection that can be had in my personal investigation  I like it  because I like to operate from that kind of mentality as a base board anyways   Hope for the best  prepare for the worst  So  again  thank you  and pardon my grammar ,1,3
Liberals keep ruining the world ,1,1
Thank you YouTube for putting this in my feed  I loved this video  I have aspired to develop an application  I feel I have a reasonable affinity for application design  which is NOT programming  from my experience doing support for software applications  But this affirms that I am more interested in the ends than I am in the means  The application I want to develop  something on the scale of a ew G Suite application  would take a team of developers or decades of learning and endless coding to achieve  I don t care for any of that  That said  I think coding could still be a useful skill for other things  but in general  I have to realize that it is a means and not an end ,1,1
Guy s don t listen to this guy be who you want to be ,2,1
I ma schoolteacher and I ve heard this several   I d say 5  times in my lifetime   I want to finish my bachelors in education and then go on to get my masters in education and be a principal    And I respond something to the effect of      But you haven t been a teacher so how do you know you re going to like it   Blank stares  I think people have a plan without knowing if they re going to like the path they planned for themselves ,1,0
The lessons you teach are not constructive  You are a burned out youtuber who is shilling products like a boardwalk salesman,3,1
I love your videos  It s kind of all in one    Dry humor mixed with honesty   Entertaining yet very informative  Keep up the good work,144,6
Thanks for watching  Hit me up there       There are profitable nods and patterns I d love to show you ,1,
I m a Principal Software Engineer with 20 years of experience and I wouldn t trade it for anything   What you should be asking people is  is it worth it to go to school for 4  years to get a degree in something that you can teach yourself ,2,2
What can I learn instead to be gain essential skills in technology  ,1,1
lol this was pretty blunt   Having been in the  tech  world for almost 20 years now  I ve found that some people  myself included  are simply not developer brained  no matter how much we might want to be  there is for certain a  type  that can just grasp all of this computer science and others that cannot despite great effort   Oddly there is still a place for both in technology  strange indeed ,26,4
 Dinah Bolli you will for sure  coding is important but as I ve said  I ve been in senior positions for decades without being a  developer  and have been successful    now am I making  500K a year    nope  but that s fine  I know my limitations and I focus on my strengths and work on my weaknesses    ,1,
You expressed exactly how I feel  I ve been studying Software Engineering at university and I quickly realized that there are those who are extremely intelligent and always get good grades  those are often the ones who love to code in their spare time  and then there s people like me    I m interested in programming and I m getting better but I just don t have the brain they have  Therefore I have other skills  That s why I don t see myself as a  pure  programmer and I hope I will still be able to make it on the job market   e g   maybe as Scrum Master ,1,
I also think hes forgetting the rest of the world  The rest of the world is not so ruthless in employment and work mantra as the USA big techs  i ve lived in more than 3 countries in Europe and Asia working in IT  and each country has their own way in IT working culture    However  i agree  to be in it long term  you really do need to have a passion for it at the beginning But as always  as we get older  we realise coding is not some major acomplishment  its just a job   because other parts of your personal life take prescendance   Everyone to their own n all that     But  you gotta love it to hate it aswell lol    ,3,
Thanks for watching  Hit me up there       There are profitable nods and patterns I d love to show you,1,
Thanks for giving me a reality check   but still I m not pursuing programming for the money  I just have ideas in my head that I wish I could program that could help people   which I know will sound stereotypically cliche  but yeah,1,1
Disagree completely with the statement  using readymade software will never replace a highly optimized  fit for purpose coding  So pls stop spreading wrong information this may mislead young generation and it is unfair to them ,1,1
You hit on some critical points that are probably lost on many watching this video  You articulate subtle  yet poignant discontent with not only the state of the profession  but the context it is embedded in culturally  Well done ,62,0
Well  that definitely put a damper on my plans  I work a nerve wracking job in a metropolitan transportation authority and although i m permanent with perks and retirement benefits  i was hoping to take a year or two off to learn coding and make some money away from my regular job  Thanks alot ,3,2
 TropiCool This is video is just one man s experience and opinion  It felt like I was listening to an elder giving their tired lecture  Well  back in my day   Let s just say there was A LOT of different advantages that folks in his day had  that we will never have again  Plus  with the improvements of technology in general  yeah  some jobs are greatly more simpler than they used to be  There are many overpaid industries in the world and this happens to be one of them  Just because your planning on making more money by switching into this industry  doesn t mean you won t be passionate about the field or take it seriously   No shame in being a Jack of all Trades with the ever changing world we are in  And having multiple streams of income is the norm  His comments showed that he really thinks highly of himself  And that s ok but you or we don t have to think so   The only person s opinion that will ever get in your way is your own opinion of yourself  Good luck with what ever YOU decide ,3,
You should still do it  Do a quick job search in your area for software engineers  The demand is never ending  The pay is still better than 90  of careers out there ,2,
I ve had the same conversation  just in strategy consulting  Immensely valuable but hits hard  Currently debating a lot whether to go down the tech or consulting route    Any thoughts by peers ,2,1
I am considering  the tech route too  I think you just have to have realistic expectations  Every company has it s politics and bureaucracy  It s unavoidable  This video kind of felt like more of a reality check for people who have never worked in a corporate climate  I think having this skill set will afford you more opportunities than it will disadvantage you  It just depends on what you re hoping to achieve from it  I certainly don t expect a half a million salary and a home in California  Just a reasonable living ,1,
Do a vid on high functioning autism  as a millionaire ,1,0
I think coders scraping by  like me  just got roasted big time  And I didn t even do it for money  I just liked computers,1,0
I agree   Back in the 1970s when I learned to code  the computer was more expensive than programmers    I got promoted because of my ability to work with users and customers in their own terms and write specifications that both the customer and the programmers could understand    I only coded if it was faster for me to code than explain and control the coding process   This led me to be recognized as a problem solver by executive management     Eventually coding became something I did at home for fun   I stopped learning new languages because their was a faster way to get things than coding   Maybe this all goes back to my childhood intent to be an efficiency expert   Coding was a tool in a vast array of ever more and better tools   Learning coding is like learning geometry  it is good for disciplining the mind ,50,0
This guy s narcissism is HILARIOUS  ,1,0
Thanks for this   I have long lamented my choice to avoid this career path knowing it would ultimately lead to a force saturation   I could see this in visual Basic and C  that very low level coding was going the way of the dinosaur for the most part  and putting mid level well within the reach of the novice  An important point to share in my case is that I COULD have retired on the income I would have made in the first 15 20 years  based on my ability at that time and the moderate pay scale available locally   Early adoption  risk taking  and a more comprehensive evaluation of the career market would have changed everything for me   I tend to think very long range  and this can be  crippling without fully considering the potential of the middle timeline   The basic question is  will your choice support your need and goals  when you need them most    As I said  had I thought of this  my life would be remarkably different  and likely   better  ,13,2
 Raf galv o I agree   Mine is a journey not over  but to be effective I always consider the past as part of a plan for the future   I defeated myself in a way because I saw the long range limitations  so in this case I am left with something very similar to your comment  what steps do I take each day knowing  perhaps  the next part is only for a limited time   Again  I know now that had I taken the path of coding  my work would surely have become somewhat redundant by now  how I would have adjusted to avoid it along that path is another story   One adjustment would have been to live simply and wisely  collecting a majority of that  high pay  for the day the run was over   In my case I think by now I could have had less stress  and done more work I enjoyed than work for necessity alone    and to me this is the ultimate goal ,3,
It s easy to look at the past and imagine a better past  But there s only now,2,

Damn  you spoke about an issue that Jordan Peterson brought up recently  There are so many social justice programs that people no longer look at your skills but at your race and other factors which should never influcence anyone into hiring someone ,2,0

I dont know if he s sarcastic or not  This is weird ,1,0
ok  so this is really one sided   I want to learn coding for games   or program a robot   you re looking at it like you have to develop the next big website or app and nothing else   really sad  embarrassing  and narrow minded,1,0
It makes me doubt your a ex google ex facebook engineer,1,1
Good points but tone down the arrogance   ,1,1

On the other hand  if the whole world is moving into tech orientation then everybody should know how to code at least a little because it will be NECESSARY    I did laugh a lot  especially at the stereotypical top coder style  autistic spectrum  level honesty    I just dress down to earth like this so that you can watch me and find me relatable  lol  defeats the purpose a little when you lose control of your compulsion to let people know of your psychologically manipulative tactics LOL  But  HOPEFULLY makes some people smarter    Note  those  stupid little java projects  are baby steps which you also took  maybe when you were actually a baby   and a necessary part of learning the basics of programming    so I hope people took that sort of comment with a pinch of salt  I wouldn t like to see anyone actually discouraged by this video unless  you genuinely feel there s something else you d rather do with your life  but that s not just because coding is a trend and you want to be a little involved  any career path chosen for just money isn t a happy  fulfilling one but you know what  Lots of people take that path anyway because of REALITY  and when talking about inclusion of diversity making people with natural skill less included  well are all those asian male stereotype nerds in programming loving their jobs and naturally talented or were they also pushed by their culture  parents  society to get into this career path for    MONEY     Ofcourse  those who were naturally interested will be better at the job  but those being naturally talented towards programming are not of one ethnicity  so why was the field saturated with asian males to begin with  Only because they were pushed to get into it  which is exactly why you re discouraging people to do it  for any other reason than being innately interested and passionate about it    so maybe it s a good thing if you don t encourage your son to be a programmer  unless he wants to do it ,1,0
I m an investment banker and this came up in my recommendations  Have always been curious about how the tech guys are doing and your perspective was insightful and pretty funny  We are seeing the same diversity initiatives in finance  but compared to coding the skills are even less essential  Everything I do at work I could teach someone in far less than a week s time  The industry has become just a game of acing the interview and grinding base level grunt work for a few years  We advise tech companies and the people seem smart enough  though those in tech have different personalities from finance people  Interesting video  thanks,54,8
 Xentrolis It might have been a long time  It the current hiring method for many companies  and it not ending any time soon  It based on an old socialist type hiring method that has failed with time  Right now it a cultural war shift to end the old method of hire who right for the job    Rest of it has really nothing to do with it  just they need the jobs within the circle to make it work  The call for Diversity is part of it also ,1,
 Spaghetti God Original You said it s been a long time  so maybe they did that before but don t today  I m willing to entertain that as a possibility  But I m here to say as a person in a minority group in tech  focused on improving diversity within tech  that any company doing this is doing diversity inclusion equity wrong  It s not even good from a logistics perspective  If you hire someone who is underqualified for a job  they will perform poorly at that job and either require extensive guidance or be fired  So a model based on that isn t sustainable  No  we need more  qualified  black people  we need more  qualified  women ,1,
 Spaghetti God Original Do you have a source for that  The only thing I could find that was leaked regarding Google and diversity was that their recruiting teams have been urging executives to take more action toward transparency wrt to pay equity and promotions  Which is 100  the right thing to do  In the US  it s illegal for employers to discourage employees from sharing what they make with each other ,3,
This guy is spitting out lies about the harm of diversity initiatives  I m a black senior engineer who helps interview candidates and participate in diversity activities at work   I also happen to work at one of these big tech companies  We re always super clear that we don t want people to end up in positions they re not qualified for  What we focus on is decreasing how unconscious and conscious bias can influence hiring decisions  for instance  by using gender neutral language  so managers don t feel inclined to hire someone because they want more women  or don t   We also focus a lot on making education and hands on training accessible  and improve visibility on the path to engineering or manager roles for lower level employees like data center technicians  who tend to be non white   No one s looking for a free job  I would be quite upset if I learned that I got my current job because of the color of my skin  and not my 10  years of professional experience ,14,
Thanks for the honest conversation  I was coming to the same conclusion as well  Programming is just simply a tool  that s all  It is not even guaranteed to be around in the next 10 15 years,4,0
Thanks for keeping it real  I am a programmer with 15 years of experience  I enjoy programming and problem solving  but I hate the business side of the job  Meetings  email  dealing with the business unit especially when they are whinny and demanding  I like the working at the computer and creating something cool  Anyone doing it just to make lots of money is an incentive but will eventually leave you feeling empty and disenchanted  Do what you love and be happy regardless of how much money is on the table ,167,9
 George Daniels sounds like you would be good at Project Management or Business Analyst ,1,

 Muskan Asudani That s a good question  I ve been looking all my life and at 61 years old I m still looking for things that I enjoy doing  There is no easy answer some people start out knowing with they wont and some spend a life time looking  One thing for certain is you wont find it if you don t look  Just look something that excites you then try it and if you decide you don t like it start looking for something else ,2,
i just have a question     what do i do if i dont know what i love,4,
That s why you need God and your family,6,
 Christoph Backhaus its interesting how you make coding to be a media for art  I used to be an artist but now im thinking about coding as I like figuring out how things work  I actually enjoy making cool stuff that is functional so this might be the job I need ,2,
I understand what you mean  I learned to code because I love to code  I love to solve problems because every time the code finally clicks feels fantastic  It is and always will be an Art  At the end of each program  I have this piece of art that I want to show around    Meetings  email  dealing with the business unit especially when they are whiny and demanding     Absolutely  That is why I am about to launch my own startup that will get rid of all of this stuff  NO meeting  NO email  NO business unit and no one that tells you to do anything ,7,
Besides wanting to be a software developer  you have to get a degree   Your best bet is to get a Master s degree   I strongly believe if you get through that  then pretty much you can be a coder   Anyone less than that is a questionable developer   I know the type and they are slugs in the group ,1,0

This video is hilarious  But to upcoming devs or people who are interested in coding  please don t be put off by this guy  He s just a youtube character    I m a senior dev  At moment my salary is   200k  it s not going to make me a millionaire  BUT it s a comfortable living and I do genuinely enjoy what I do  It definitely has boring days  but there are also really fun days that you get to work on creating solutions to complex issues with like minded people    The fact is you do need to put in time and effort and not just watch  HOW TO CODE IN 24H  youtube clips    As for the future comment  5 10 years before coders become obsolete  That is absolute horseshit  I ve been hearing that for 5 years and the demand and salary for developers are as high as they ve ever been  The coding platform is going to change  But it changes slowly because most companies aren t going to uproot their entire infrastructure to the latest and greatest  And during the slow transition  if you re at all engaged and interested in your role  you will evolve with it    So  if you like coding  Be a coder  Because it could be the funnest way to make money  If you don t like coding and are doing it to make money  it s going to be a disappointing journey ,10,0

I m not a Programmer  but this talk has helped me figure out what career path I should look into  My story  I made the mistake of getting a degree in Kinesiology  passion for being fit myself  misguided myself into a job in personal training that is a dead end and bores me   The part about the painter and the interest in the paints or the lasting effect the audience feels hit home for me as a California native who also wanted to make movies  which I have subsided into a passive hobby rather than the full blown crusade I was on before Covid hit  It feels like all majors and job markets are inflated  and I don t trust a single company on their diversity questionnaire  If you look at the people working certain jobs you can see there is still a clear bias in hiring certain races and genders for certain roles  Companies should honestly just post what race and gender they want and stop wasting everyones time pretending they care about anyone  In the end I have to just find something I like to do either with or without the public and find peace in that while being their for my family and friends cause that s all I really have at this point  Thanks for your insight ,1,0
I appreciate the honesty so much  I love it  Also saying  I make it look easy but I m really  really good at what I do   Self love ,24,0
I loved this ,1,1
Thank you very much   you really solved my confusion to go for coding with new programming language as I am 35 year old now a 11 years experience in software industry  Just thought to increase my language stack  but your chat suggests to focus on other things which may help to get success  Bitter word but precise for software world  Loved your opinion and knowledge sharing ,22,0

It s awesome how to see a person who has sympathy and intelligence at the same time  Now I understand why he got what he got   ,1,0
Do you even know what you are talking about  you are so confused  Instead of encouraging people  you are telling them you are so special and it s not easy for others and so they can try something else  Programming is not tough if one has little passion for it and language doesn t matter ,1,0
 You don t have to mix your passion with your actual work     this is the absolute truth  Time is money  you either have both or neither  If you focus on pay in terms of career choice  you ll free up time for your passions  If you try to turn your passion into a job  you might end up hating it because of the stress induced from life s financial obligations ,3,0

As a core developer in a company that develops CNC milling algorithms  luckily most of this doesn t seem to apply to me  I don t see my job replaced by machine learning algorithms  I m working on interesting geometrical and numerical problems where I can apply what I learned at university  and actually invent useful  novel algorithms that others can use and appreciate  Also  my working conditions are very good  I really can t complain and even senior developers actually code a lot  I guess at Google and or in the US this is different  I m German  ,15,12
 Ediko Naja ich sollte hier wahrscheinlich besser nicht zu viel preisgeben  vor allem was bestimmte Kunden angeht  aber genau sowas wie die zugrundeliegenden Algorithmen in MasterCAM  um Werkzeugwege zu berechnen und auch Abtragssimulationen durchzuf hren  entwickeln wir in unserer Firma  Also wir sind nicht selbst wie MasterCAM  sondern Entwickler f r Libraries  auf denen MasterCAM ihre Software aufbauen kann  Dazu geh ren auch diverse Algorithmen  um Oberfl chennetze zu vereinfachen  2 Netze miteinander zu schneiden  scharfe Kanten darin zu erkennen oder irgendwelche L cher und L cken zu schlie en  Ich erstelle selbst allerdings kaum Oberfl chennetze von Bauteilen von grund auf  au er vielleicht um neue Algorithmen zu testen  wobei das dann aber eher die Qualit tssicherung f r uns Entwickler macht  Die Herausforderung ist dabei in der Regel  dass auch sehr au ergew hnliche Situationen funktionieren sollen  ohne andere gew hnlichere Situationen zu beeintr chtigen  Wir versuchen quasi  eierlegende Wollmilchs ue zu entwickeln  was meist auch ganz gut klappt  Wir sind halt in ner Studentenstadt und haben daher ziemlich pfiffige Entwickler  Unser CEO ist urspr nglich sogar selbst einer und mischt sich gerne auch mal in ziemlich tiefe Details ein mit echt hilfreichem Input ,1,
 Ediko Hallo  ja grob kann man das so sagen  Allerdings bekommen wir in der Regel beliebige Oberfl chennetze aus Dreiecken oder Nurbs  die mit CAD Programmen designed wurden  Das definiert dann die Oberfl chen und oder Kanten  die bearbeitet werden sollen  zusammen mit einem Haufen Einstellungen und Parametern  zum Beispiel Strategie  Werkzeugtyp und  geometrie  erforderliche Genauigkeit  Bearbeitungsrichtung  climb conventional   Sicherheitsabst nde bzgl  Kollisionen und so weiter  Wenn wir einen Fehler bei der Kollisionserkennung verursachen  kann unter Umst nden passieren  dass dann irgendjemand einen Maschinenarm quer durchs Werkst ck schickt und dann kommst du als Servicetechniker wahrscheinlich ins Spiel     ,1,

 Greaseman Texas  I m a developer of software libraries that other companies can use to implement their own CNC programs   So we re not using any specific program for any CNC machines ourselves  instead other companies can use our libraries for general geometric toolpath generation algorithms in their programs  In particular  I m working mostly on a  Deburring strategy for various 3 to 6 axis machines with various tool types  Programming language is mostly C   for us and a little bit C Sharp every now and then  but experience with linear algebra  numerical analysis and all sorts of geometry related algorithms is more important than the language ,1,
I watched this because my son is nerd  He carries a 4 0 gpa  not an athlete  and loves video games  So  I recommended he build a life he wants to live  Basically  earn a living knowing how to build the things you pay for anyway   Thanks for the advice ,1,0
the fact that i just wanna make slightly above minimum wage as a freelancer actually makes this video quite encouraging to me,1,0
he has a point  but i think what you should learn is how to use those different new platforms and tools in coding today  it is what i am doing  i have basic knowledge in core language these platforms are using  and learned new tools platforms and keep  updated  now i can do almost anything website  mobile apps  softwares  graphic designs  video effects  3d modeling   I think what i can advice is be strategically smart and use those skills for income ,1,0

 Tom Brooks Starting a company would have taken even more time and energy  It isn t easy and it is 24 7 for for many years and with a low chance of success   Here is the thing  All careers are hard and demanding  Doctors may make much more money  but they are also much more stressed and sleep deprived  The best is to just be born rich or get lucky with an early investment like bitcoin ,4,
 Tom Brooks Your reflection is sad  Missed opportunities  friendship development  time w  children  entrepreneurship   It s not over though  Parlay that solution oriented  analytical bent into something meaningful for you now  At least you can focus intensely for long blocks of time  Many cannot do that  so take advantage of the skills you did develop from your self described ill suited previous career  Best of luck ,1,
Like the guy said  some people are just different  We are all built different  Ironically  I did 20  years as a software engineer and wish I would have never even heard of it   I truely believe it helped ruin my life  I should have stepped into owning my own business 15 years earlier  Wasted all those years in endless programming jobs that gave absolutely nothing back and took everything from me including time with my kids and a wife who left me for apparently growing apart and never being home  Software programming literally gave me nothing lasting and took everything from me includinf years of social engagements and potentially life long friendships I never got the opportunities for thanks to the endless revolving door ,19,

To me he s saying   Don t Learn An Instrument     to become a Rockstar    Don t learn to code because you met a dude that makes a ton of money for little work as a software engineer at some company    If you don t like solving abstract problems in your head  if you don t already spend most of your time on the computer  if you don t like to be the person who has to fix something that  should work and nobody knows why it doesn t   then coding may not be for you ,4,

As a senior software engineer  I would recommend it if you are willing to dedicate most of your time to it as an interest   If you are struggling to motivate yourself to learn or be interested enough to learn by yourself as it is  Then absolutely I wouldn t    It isn t a job  It is a career  One in which you will need to spend most of your time almost constantly learning about new technologies  better ways to use existing technologies  different languages and depending on the position  if consulting  completely new domains   If you wouldn t do it without being paid  you a  aren t going to get very far or b  are going to really begin to resent it very fast ,3,0

Solid advice  I am a programmer and an entrepreneur and ppl never pay any attention to the solid work  the programming  on which my success truly depends they are only concerned with the money and influence that comes from the entrepreneurial venture   Figure out which really appeals to you  being a programmer or being an  ideas guy  because the idea guy can always hire a programmer but not the other way around   Develop your skills accordingly   If you can do it  be both ,12,7

 Anthony Ellis The concept is front end loaded to be sure but the more you master each skill set the easier they become   If they are developed concurrently a tremendous amount of synergy develops   A daunting task in the beginning  totally worth the effort and you can do it   Read  Mastery  by Robert Greene  it helps ,3,

Exactly  Learn to be good corporate politician instead  First  as mediocre engineer learn buzz words and find narcissistic managers to work for and flatter  Then  learn to tell lies and how to effectively blame people for your mistakes  Afterwards find like minded people to collaborate with and stab them in the back for gain  As you rise in management be sure your subordinates depend on you  and hang on your every word  Loudly participate in every Social Justice fad your HR department embraces to better hide your moral shortcomings  As you rise to the top you will notice your alcohol consumption increasing  that s OK  This is a sign of success  Drunken parties with upper management colleagues is a great way to bond  and maybe get dirt on someone to use later  As the company fails due to your incompetence you can set up a buy out  execute stock options and get a cushy job as a board member in another company  Let the nerds code and struggle to find employment while you sip margarita s on the beach ,4,0

 just hypothetically  that gave me a good laugh,1,0
I have a cs degree from 10 years ago and my instructors were constantly talking about the saturation even back then  I went ahead just because I liked it   I still like it and I want to update my skills and probably will soon in a self guided Bootcamp  Sadly though to say I think of it as just a hobby  If u are doing it just for the money   you are going to be discouraged  I am not doing it professionally because programming made me pull my hair out  Yet I am now going back  Ha  My instructors used to joke that I must like pain ,8,0

Your looking at 500k or more senior software engineers  However  if someone is comfortable with a 75k   salary and their preferred lifestyle does not demand more than that income wise then you can get to a 75k  salary job as a programmer pretty quickly  I used 75K because that clearly puts you in top 1 3 of income in the US  If 75k is what you need to live the lifestyle you want programming would be a good choice  There are very few other fields where a 22 year old right out of college is going to pull 75k  as a starting salary ,239,27

Lots of people commenting on this from the perspective of large tech companies are forgetting that there are a ton of non tech companies that still employ large engineering teams building maintaining internal software  They don t have to deal with the crazy deadlines or hours because the client is their own company  if something isn t right or completed on time it gets pushed to the next sprint  I m not an engineer  but I work everyday with them and none of them regularly work more than 40 hrs a week and they all make well into the six figures ,9,
 Satoru Thats only true if you work with the biggest tech companies  A lot of coders work with much much smaller companies that dont have that sort of multiple deadlines  Its like saying every logistic company have their drivers sleep in their trucks for most of the month  Thats not true ,3,
 Pratyaksh It still doesn t change the point of my post  which is that people can scale down their hours if they choose too   In other words  somebody does not have to have extremely high hours to keep a nice income ,2,
 mouthpiece200 that s not how it works  People think higher compensation   higher work hours in tech   At big tech   it s the opposite   the more senior you get the more kind of managerial role you get into taking on projects  And the wlb at big tech is super good plus the salary is insane,1,

And thanks to COVID you can live anywhere in the US  or quite often anywhere in the world and make that same salary so long as your employer can deal with paying you remotely and deal with altered timezones ,2,
 Satoru I d love to escape trucking to do something needing brain power again  used to love computers  but reading about all the bosses you re answering too and this wave of mass produced coders from India and China  kinda wonder if I should just slug it out doing what I hate  Lol   Problem with trucking is once you ve survived the 1st couple years you sink into it and become sedated   Once a  sedated truck driver  anything requiring more work than driving seems like a monumental task ,7,
 Tom Brooks I m a data scientist  I guess more specifically I m an applied ML engineer   I haven t really experienced having to work all that hard  I just train up some models and build a simple application to deploy it  Browse Reddit in between training and or deployment  IDK ,11,
 Unicorn only a lazy programmer is doing the bare minimal at 40 hours a week  Most top level programmers I know are putting in hours until 11 00pm   3 00am in the morning weekly forgoing their families and children  Not sure where or what industry you are in my friend  If you haven t been hit my the massive wave of international remote competition yet  you will be and they will absolutely work 70 hours a week to out compete you for your job easily ,2,
 Keylanos Lokj Nope  Not if you want to out compete everyone else for THAT job  Programming has become a very cut throat industry   Not to mention I hope you gambled by learning the correct newest language set ,1,
where the hell is 500k from the montly pay of 500k yearly is the average yearly pay    ,1,
 Satoru wtf job are u  doing    I am coming into  work for 40 hrs a week max   and im  out  no extra time and im getting paid a little under 6 figs out  of school  ,19,
 mikeswierczek My intent isn t discouraging people getting into coding but a more realistic perspective as technical trade schools and colleges have a financial incentive to candy coat the opportunities   We re competing globally for the same supply of gigs to be completed in a field where remote working is rapidly growing  Gotta find that protection whether it be security clearance based job or moving to a lower cost of living country to get paid less but take home more in pocket after overhead ,7,
 Satoru   there are a lot of boring business coding jobs out there that don t pay like Facebook and Google but don t require crazy hours either   I ve been a developer for 20 years and my average work week across my career is below 45 hours ,18,
 Keylanos Lokj Not a competitive one  Not at the start no ,3,
 Satoru cant be a programmer with 50 hours work per week ,4,
Coding is like being a semi truck driver   it pays good but the work   personal life balance is hell  Instead of reporting to one boss every client and each level of management of the project will be a thorn over petty or unrealistic expectations  Sure  you could work 80  hrs week to meet deadline but how will your significant other and children accept this  Sometimes the simple things in life are the most cherished that money can t buy as in seeing your kid compete and keeping those promises to actually showing up at the finals  Yet  at that moment you ll have 20  bosses up you butt stressing deadlines as the client was aiming for a moonshot lottery winning complete program or become bankrupt  Which  is life or death in their view ,36,

You are forgetting about coding in AI  Deep Learning  Robotics  VR  AR and high end gaming  These emerging fields pay well and need programmers  If you don t specialize and try to program business software and website you won t get paid anything ,82,6
 Tom Brooks I mean yes  but A  you don t need an extremely well paying job  a decent one will do most people just fine  and B  you should be looking to go into programming because you enjoy doing it  The people who actually enjoy doing it don t tend to be that interested in making business software websites ,3,
Blockchain as well   ,1,
 Tom Brooks that s what every job looks like aside from the underpaying labor governmental ones  The truth is that you don t need to make 6 figures farting out to live a nice lifestyle  unless you re dumb and moved to a large smelly city  younger people complain about not being able to buy homes like boomers did but don t realize that they re trying to buy a 3 000 sq ft home with 2020 amenities while their grandparents had 500 600 sq ft Homes that we re several years old,9,
Future AI  Deep Learning  Robotics  VR  AR and high end gaming not going to pay you today  So you seem to have contradicted yourself  And yes I agree the only paying fields today are pretty much business software websites  The rest are just buzz techno babble words  Trust me    been hearing it for 2 decades now  They all come and go  If you find  any of those allusive jobs today  chances are you have a million resumes in front of you also applying ,8,

I think main conclusion of this is that there is some sadness  when your reach certain wisdom in something  I can truly understand that but not about IT industry but about life  people and careers generally  Also this is perception of people who are on high spiritual level or introverts  This is what it is,3,0
 Your passion for coding may actually be a passion for success    This was the answer I was looking for  and I m very surprised that I found it laid out so simply  Thank you for this video ,1159,24

 LIMO  Yeah  would likely  would  fair poorly  without those traits    but Law and Medical Doctor   ing      also   have such traits you may or may notfair poorly at  with a whole extra few years worth of things to learn from experts before you can be properly certified  Passion  could  get you there  but it d have to be   really   high for you to be able to say  yeah  I could do that  without more of the talents  those  would require  a lot of them  are  basically just complicated problem solving with different sets of information  so bear in mind I m not   actually   disagreeing with you  ,1,

 Alien that s what I ve been saying you can t be a great programmer without the talent for problem solving or at least passion for problem solving without it you gonna fail am i right ,1,
 Jim J that s the whole point of this video and the original comment  People want the hype or lifestyle around it,4,
 Conor Healy Lol  Only a tiny number of programmers engineers make 500k  on 40 ours a week  There are probably more lawyers earning  1 million   per year than that ,2,
 Jim J every job he listed is similar in a way in the amount of time   patience you must have  While youre in school 4 6 extra years learning to be a doc or lawyer  that tech dude is stringing together internships to try to land a job that will let him work 40 hours a week making 500k ,1,
 Jim J they were just using those as examples of jobs that sound impressive to people not comparing the actual difficulty of the jobs,7,
 Alien Lol  Do you realize that being a doctor or a lawyer is ten times harder than being a programmer  Imagine taking life and death decisions while being sleep deprived and having relatives of the patients and colleagues judging every move you take ,7,
Great quote  As for everything,1,
 Pablo Heredia Some people want to become a programmer simply because it s a job that makes a lot of money and makes you sound very smart  like a doctor or lawyer   If you walked in a room and introduced your job as  I m an AI engineer who s designing a self driving system for Tesla   most people immediately assume that you re rich  smart and successful   A lot of times that s what people who want to start out in programming want to be  successful    However  people don t know the drawback of the tech industry and how stressful it is to a programmer  and the amount of languages  software and tech you have to constantly learning and also unexpected long hours of crunching  Not discouraging anyone from programming  but people should know what being a developer is like as a career first  rather than doing it because it sounds like something that will lead them to be rich and successful ,22,
 MadofaA I don t really care what my grammar is like on a YouTube comment  just being honest  Thanks for the heads up  ,18,
 ElSlappo Yes  Pity you didn t use some of those  immensely powerful tools  to fix your grammar and spelling  Just saying ,11,
Agreed  I use other people s software and often ponder on how I could improve and  perfect  it  and am often disappointed when programmers release software and equipment that is not at full functionality  I could never release something that I didn t think was truly innovative  Things have been done before  and not to a high standard  and I feel like because majority of people don t have intelligence when it comes to networks and software  it s overlooked and kind of just allowed  This should not be the case  as the information and tools we have access to nowadays is immensely powerful ,6,

Google produce some of the flakiest  broken code in 2021   The abundant bugs in their devices like Nest Hub etc are shocking   The sheer amount of temperamental output from their highly paid devs is insane   For that reason I believe the badge  Google dev  or  ex Google dev  should be a stark warning to any prospective employer to avoid an individual like the plague   Pichai s Google in 2021 consistently produces way too much broken code and the IT world needs to recognise that QC at Google is woefully lacking ,1,0

You have some very interesting commentary   I didn t listen to it all but I can appreciate what you are saying   I think one thing that perhaps you should consider when discussing programming is that it is actually an art form for many   It s a creative outlet as much as writing music and painting can be for some people    When creativity walks into programming it is something that can evoke a passion for producing fantastic products   I have been involved with many start ups and seen them go to zero to top of their industry   That energy is where I suggest younger developers to find a position   The ideas that younger minds offer for creativity in software development make them invaluable   So  thank you for sharing your view  it s always a good listen  this time I thought I would have to mention the creative factor that I believe will always be a part of the software industry at all levels of development   Cheers ,1,0
I m into coding as a hobby  I d hate to do it as a job   I ve got to be in the mood for coding   One of the things I do like is when the program is coming together as I feel achievement seeing it work more and more   Then the thing breaks randomly every 15 runs and you re pulling your hair out trying to find the bug  It s usually something silly like re using a variable or a typo ,1,0

As a mechanical engineer would it be useful to delve deeper into programming or is it a waste  and what skills would you recommend picking up besides programming ,3,3
 Its Laxx of course it is  Just start somewhere  and just like techlead said  start with an actual PROJECT  Have a goal in mind  I dropped out of mechanical engineering  even though I wanted to become one  I m a horrible academic   I m trying to compensate by using the knowledge I build up from mechanics  did some self studying on advanced mathematical techniques in the context of  partial  differential equations  discrete differential geometry for representation of 3D objects  and general programming and hope to have an equivalent skillset at the end of the journey ,1,
If you re a mechanical engineer without programming skills  I have some ideas off the top off my head that would be enabled if you were to learn how to program  Apply your knowledge of calculation pipelines arising in mechanical engineering problems to automate these by means of API s of the already existing computer algebra systems and numerical solvers  e g  MATLAB  Siemens software  or even better  program the numerical algorithms manually for a real challenge   Learn some inverse kinematics and optimal control theory  or even AI techniques to build a robot  Learn some IoT systems basics and use that knowledge to monitor large collections of sensors for data analysis and optimisation of efficiency in large systems  Learn low level programming languages for embedded mechanical systems like the control systems on missiles  drones etc  or biomedical  systems ,1,

As a professional programmer of 20 years  I completely disagree  Yes  it was much more time consuming in the past  without the  shortcuts  like  Net library etc  and now it takes 10 times less to code the same thing  but that just means a single programmer can build something only a team of programmers could do a few years ago    it s a good thing  Go forth and build  bee atches ,6,3
 Gyps That is often the case  but not always   You don t have to go to those extremes anymore but that doesn t mean it s acceptable to be completely careless and waste every resource   I have seen lots of software that runs more slowly now on the latest computers than previous versions did years ago on much older computers   It is also unacceptable to hog all the memory  CPU time  network capacity  etc  based on the assumption that your program is the only one running on the machine ,1,
 Sexy Geek Naa  it s not 1985 anymore    hardware is improving rapidly  no need to spend days trying to write code that maximises every byte or ram or cpu cycle  at the expense of easy to maintain code  to save a fraction of a ms in execution time   That s old and outdated thinking,2,
I m delighted you took the time to share with me the top strata of the Code industries  Digital marketing arenas etc   You ve saved me a great deal of wasted time by quickly addressing the ROI s of the Front End and Back End careers  I haven t witnessed generosity like this in years   you ve graciously shared pearls of wisdom that saved many from costly and painful disappointment  Felt like I was listening to an elite cloud dweller from the series  Carbon    Thought I had to learn code to create automated form fills within landing pages that I ll create for customers  Ultimately  I want to produce customized marketing templates for small business owners that will produce specific lead types for them  I have 25 years of sales and marketing skill sets and yet I m smart enough to know I am digitally ignorant  Therefore  I must have a working knowledge of digital  machines  that will filter and leverage prospect information for my customers ,13,0

i fell into coding and did it for about 6 years    the last 4 of those years i hated it  it was super boring and not fitted to my personality  eventually i felt that i had wasted those years and started another career in networking and also business   being able to code helped me build a proper functional website  host it and all for minimum money   i also networked my servers and pcs and life became fun and cheap    in hindsight i am really grateful for my years of coding  it came in so useful for my entrepreneureal spirit  and even when i was broke  it led me to success   without the coding  i dont think i would have progressed so fantastically  it is worth learning to code   but a decent programmer only earns a reasonable wage  learn to code so you are self sufficient in business startups  and also have no fear of new technology  that said    the guy was speaking pure facts   you have to be a geek  willing to knuckle down and spend hours and hours working stuff out   it is not glamorous   ,1,0
Just to put this in perspective for anyone who isn t completely convinced by his amazing self grandeur  keep this in mind   You do not have to be anything but  good  when it comes to getting into Google or any other silicon valley company   My housemate who attended a computer programming bootcamp GOT IN    That s right   Now he s coding front end projects at Google   How did this happen   He knew somebody and there and when a position became available  he and this other person simple crafted a resume that looked appropriate and Voila   Do you have to be good be a tech lead  NO   Most tech leads aren t good programmers  It s another position where networking and crafting the right documentation can get you in   Most had no passion for coding and weren t good at it anyway   This position changes simply put them in charge of others who did the grunt work while they themselves can barely code themselves out of a brown paper bag    Remember this   A computer is a discrete finite machine with a discrete logic   Anybody can code it if they understand how it works and everyone is capable of understanding how it works   It just may happen faster for some than others   Also  don t believe there is anything special about the code people write   Most programmers write horrible code and think it s amazing  which is why it breaks so often   Someone always needs to remind them that simple is better and tricks are for kids also USE THE APIs correctly ,1,0

I have spent the last 25 years as a programmer  and it has afforded me a lot of opportunities to travel and make a decent amount of money to live a good lifestyle   That said  I would recommend against becoming a programmer unless it is something you really really enjoy doing   I would tell my son to do almost anything else he is passionate about ,1,2
I think just being a shy introverted person made me interested in computers as an outlet  I got my first programming highs when I would get a program running  and it continued with the  aha  moments you get when programming solutions just clicked in my mind  I also received positive reinforcement in my youth  with friends and relatives thinking I was so clever for creating such and such a program  I guess I continued to crave that sense of acknowledgement throughout my 25 year career and did get it from time to time which kept me going  Recently however I find my interest waning  having to learn and deal with the intricacies of new needlessly complex frameworks and pretty much the same type of CRUD program being rewritten this way and that over and over again  I am also noticing that my salary potential is not growing in line with other industries or roles  with people with half the experience earning almost as much as me and vying for the same jobs  I ve been a tech lead at companies  and even had a short stint as a manager a decade ago which I absolutely hated because  well  people suck  and honestly my people management skills sucked then too  This year was the first year someone considerably junior than me has more or less been my tech manager and it s made me think of throwing in the towel  Indeed it is possible that soon my age will be a hiring factor and I ll have to start culling my resume  So I joined the channel because I ve decided it s way past time to create my own start up  having been distracted with many with others invented by other people over the years  I am getting too old for this career  hit and it s time to become a techpreneur ,2,1

 Flash Maddy very clever,1,
I m working 25 years in the industry   yes for living  You are damn right  i do it for living and do it for fun  Writing a good software for me is similar to write a good poem novel for others  You are damn good that since 2000 there are tons of people here what are should not be here  You can see in the long run they are moving towards to bullshit jobs  People are saying that in industry 2 0 doing coding is a way to earn a lot  Since there are a lot of us  this is getting to an end  As You have mentioned one can buy turnkey systems from Amazon   consider netflix  I would change Your statement  Do whatever You do if it has impact in the world surrounding You  if you can do useful things for others  E g  one of my friend is bought a CNC  a fusion360 and became a carpenter ,3,0
I want to learn to code for a few reasons  1  is of course money  that s a huge plus for me  But 2  I want to work remotely  and coding would give me that opportunity ,3,0
computer science was a branch which happened to me because my Dad don t want me to be like him that is being a civil engineer  I got the good seat in regional college for civil engineering but couldn t take it because my Dad doesn t approve it and want me to opt for computer science in a private college  Followed Dad s suggestion and I never regretted it atleast for 10 12 yrs because it use to bring lot of money on table  However somehow I lost interest now and to be honest algo was not my cup of tea  I like design  animation and art more than this coding stuff  I realise this very late  Anyway it s never late and I am pursuing my dream after 12 15 yrs of work experience  However  these days algorithm videos are pulling me into it even though I suck at algorithms   ,11,1
A lot of parents tell their kids to not follow their career  Doctors tend to tell their kids to not become doctors etc  The reason is because most jobs suck  People only do it for the money  And how can you blame them  People need money to have a life ,1,

I was recently deaded by Amazon and this video was further depressing me until I heard that it took you  the Tech Lead himself  10 years to get into Google  I have been doing this for 6 years so far  so maybe there s still hope  I will be just like the Tech Lead one day ,2,1
good luck,3,
Thanks Tech lead  I am more into the entrepreneur side  Get the money using the skill  and use the money to build the product I want to build using same skills ,2,0

So because I m 29 and frustrated with my slothful life  I decide to learn this stuff because it s vastly accessible and available and has potential  But it IS discouraging when you had to have done this since you were a kid and be passionate about it like mozart with his piano  Lots of people go to school not doing what they studied for as a kid and go on to being great at it ,238,28

 Javier Palacios no way 5 months and you already have a job  mmmm sounds weird,1,
This is just not true  I started coding at 27 and I have a very good job and enjoying it very much ,1,
Hey   this might give u some hope  so my dad left his musician job at 43 yo and decided to restart from scratch  He took night classes of CS during 3 years while still taking care of us during daytime  He got his diploma and has now been working in tech for 5 years  It s never too late if you put your mind to it    Hope you find your way soon  ,13,
 Nick Loves Data thought about it  I m actually currently in the process of developing a platform for new devs  I ll start it as a completely free resource and see where it goes  but my eventual plan is to make it a low cost per month subscription based model  It ll combine coding execution environments and solution videos as well as practical real world examples of use cases that aren t ridiculous  Hopefully you ll try it out some day ,2,

 dennis kennetz I appreciate you being very nice and taking the time to reach out to me here  Thank you   I made the decision now to start back school and thought about pursuing pharmacy  Get the pharmD and running a shoppers drug mart  I gotta start back from high school math prerequisites because it s been many years but I ll pace myself ,30,
Stay the course  I don t know if this is supposed to be entirely satire or he s serious  haha  The hardest part about getting a job in tech is getting your first job because the entry level market is saturated  Once you have about a year of experience  everything after that is cake and you make a great living  I love what I do  but I have a family and don t live eat and breathe code  but I still get to work on fun projects and I get paid well for my work  It s still a great market ,66,

Been enjoying your hypnotic robot videos  Good persona  and an interesting take   This one kind of reminds of  The Tooth Fairy   film   but I am pretty sure you are right  40 years ago it was pioneering passion  now it is  intellectual grunt work   I think we are going to have to accept our future as  content creators   This will be the great decoupling dream   hordes of entitled westerners churning out masses of youtube tiktok instagram waffle  This is the future Huxley warned us about  No signal  only noise ,1,0
i ended up dropping out of IT and coding and moved onto electrician seccurity trades i noticed that almost every single one of my friend is studying IT or coding and i realized how extremely overcrowded that work is so by the time i finish university there will be no work,2,0
Maybe he is just having so many regrets of spending much time coding instead of Friday nights and beers because he discourages newbies while he is advertising   Life is the time you spent  Meaning  no regrets if you love whatever you do and however you spend your time  At the end  we gonna die  Not all can be programmers  likewise  not all can spend their time with hot babes and or attending holy masses every Sunday ,2,0
I mean  what is wrong with being a nerd or being in some office just programming  Is being a junior programmer     not good  Are they getting paid that low  How much is too low  Could it be just decent  Where you have a good comfortable life with your family and that s it  An honest living with a good honest loving family  Not too rich  not too poor  Isn t that    great ,2,0

In between the jokes  trolling  and snark there are some really wise insights here  Id be lying if I said money was not my primary motivation  but next up is just that feeling you get when a function comes together and works  you finally fix an issue you ve been looking at for awhile  or when it clicks and you understand a complex new concept you ve been trying to learn  Its brief happiness  and a sense of fulfillment and confidence that lasts for a day or 2  That part is pretty nice at least for me ,285,11
 Tom Brooks mmm    temporary  I don t know  I chose to live in a rural area because I don t like crowds and living is pretty affordable  Also better for health and well being  Of course with that you get very little job availability in most fields  And I live in a very rural area    Don t get me wrong  I m working on a project now that will get me a  1000  But they are few and far between  What I would love to do    good question  I would love to make a decent income creating and still have the free time to enjoy life  It s what most of us want  I think  One reason the job I have now works is that I make a living wage with benefits  and I have weekends off  Unfortunately it is a night shift job and there is no real way of advancing to a better position  I am considering other options come spring  I am also married and so I don t have the luxury of just moving  But things change and so we ll see what happens next  Right now I am slowly building up my studio and I have a pretty rounded skill set   programming  3D modeling animation  film making  illustration and graphic design   I have an eye on cyber security as well ,1,
 Tom Brooks which is why I have a full time job working in a small town gas station  It sucks but pretty much every creative arts job is the same  I ve done graphic design  illustration  ECT  The market quickly becomes saturated and freelancing is tough when you re competing in a global market  It s similar with programming  Sure it s fun but the reality is more often an overworked desk job doing maintenance on websites and servers and trying to clean up after other people who leave systems vulnerable ,2,
 DesertStoneStudio the problem is 3d animation literally has no job market viability  Highly competitive and choaked out to very specific cities and genres in entertainment  You re speaking to a former 3d modeler and contractor   programmer and multimedia engineer of 20  years of experience  I watched 3d multimedia rise and fall into ashes over the last 2 3 decades ,1,
 DesertStoneStudio Yeah man its primal I think  just seeing the fruits of your labor whatever it is  Its great ,8,
I kinda feel the same way with learning 3D animation and dabbling in python  The thrill of seeing your creation come alive ,9,
Of course  that feeling is something that you need  is difficult of explain  so  if you don t feel like coding  you better don t take this way  he also said  it s a lonely career  However  if you can ask this thing without fear  then you are a programer    at least it is my conclusion ,1,
I follow you as an entrepreneur  Your advice is straight to the point  I love it  Subscribed ,7,0
I wish more people would be that honest  I am tired of bloated descriptions of jobs  When I ask what you do in a day  I literally want to know what you do in a day  I don t care if you answer is  I review paperwork  answer emails  teach classes to our employees  and interview new employees and this is how it is done ,2,0
I 100  disagree with this nihilistic attitude and message  I learned to code and still code because it s an intellectual pursuit in and of itself  a distraction from negative thoughts  something that I can think about instead of being on social media  It goes beyond being productive and just because a machine can do it better doesn t mean we should not  Then why should we run  Why should we write music or do anything else  Do it for the sheer enjoyment of it ,7,0

3 words  Narcissistic personality disorder  As this guy just says whatever crosses his mind without thinking about potential consequences  allow me to do the same   First of all  it is very clear that the main purpose of this video is for Patrick to glorify himself  The way he talks  and his body language  is almost scary  He is constantly looking for confirmation as to what he has achieved in life   which I admit   is something to be proud of  What he should not be proud of  though  is the way he is looking for this confirmation  Apparently  there is a need in him to make fun of others  ambitions and capabilities in order for him to feel good  What if somebody is aiming for that 60k per year job doing  simple tasks  as you would call it  What if this would mean that this person is making the most out of his capabilities  It s a shame that someone with his background needs to classify this as a failed career or whatever he would call that  Furthermore  comparing himself with Musk and Gates is hilarious for countless obvious reasons  To Patrick  stop with the value judgements  we know you did well  i mean  you make sure to remind us in every video  lol   but the definition of success in life is not  live like Patrick     As for the content of the video  that s also nonsense  Everything is evolving  so is coding  and it is all about constantly adjusting to trends and developments  As the great Johan Cruyff always said   Every disadvantage has its advantage  ,2,0
It s an interesting insight  But I don t know why he s taking about some top level programming and that it s not for everyone  Of course not everyone out there will work for Google  but I m pretty sure 90  of all juniors will eventually get their jobs  For example in the eastern Europe where I m from those employed in IT earn really good money and they live a decent life  making more than doctors or teachers  What I m trying to say is that IT is maybe one of the only career path that can guarantee if not rich  but at least a decent living standard ,1,0

Wow  thank you for your video  You mention rampant racism and sexism  bias against Asian males  as if it where the most natural thing in the world  Do you really think that this kind of racism is acceptable  Regarding coding  it was the only subject I flunked at University  I just never had the patience ,1,0

 Your passion for coding may be passion for success   This is seriously deep  because it is likely true ,1256,17
It is true  passion for coding should involve passion for solving complex problems and not just typing random commands and setting up desks    which is sadly never acknowledged  coding is seen more as a trend and advertised as if it is for everyone but it isn t ,2,
 Tom Brooks out of curiosity  how are you changing the world now that you aren t a programmer ,1,
bingo  Which is why I truely believe I wasted 20  years of my life programming and now regret every day of it  I masked programming faux happiness and money behind a real authentic desire to change the world via running my own business  I would never recommend programming to anyone  EVER ,1,
I m still going to learn how to code      ,2,
 MusicJosh93 Absolutely spot on   If you were rich  what hobbies and passions would you pursue   When I was in college  you could easily tell which students were there because they had a passion for computers and which students were there because they thought they could make a career out of it   The passionate ones were the gifted ones   The  I can make a career  students struggled   For good or for ill  if I didn t program for a living  I would program for a hobby   I just got lucky someone is willing to pay me to follow my passion ,2,
 brian sanchez I get that so much man  Exactly the same for me  I ve always loved computers  and know more than the average person  but that s because the medium is great  I learned about design and music on my computer  made friends on it  played games on it  etc etc  If I could choose my career  I d love to be a fashion designer  a producer musician  furniture designer  or a graphic designer  But  computer science programming helping with problem solving is a huge thing because I struggle with it so much daily  I can never make decisions  I want to be comfortable financially and I love the idea of being able to work remotely  having the option to work for a company not even close,2,
 brian sanchez The unfortunate truth is that most programming jobs are boring  and trying not to zone out is probably the hardest thing many people do day to day  If you re lucky you can land a job where you will work on some interesting projects  but most programmers spend most of their time refactoring someone else s code and making small changes to existing business code  Even the tasks to create something new will tend to be pretty simple stuff  especially after you ve done it for a few years  What s funny is I envy graphic artists  and I wish I was good enough to create game assets for a living  and programming is my hobby   ,5,

 LoRd D I m not sure about that  I would argue every big tech CEO at least once was passionate  Maybe that shifts for some over time  since the get a little insane from too much power on their hands  But if you say someone like Elon Musk is not passionate about his projects  then tell me what passion is about ,5,
 CatTonny then I don t see anything wrong there  You can get a pretty decent life if you are on an average level  Just don t expect to randomly develop a Facebook 2 0 and get super rich  If the craft makes you happy you should go for it  If you realize it s not for you don t hesitate to switch  They guy from the video explained it well  If you don t get discouraged by what he said you re perfectly fine ,19,
 CatTonny Don t get a programmer when you only are passionate about the dollars that people think is flying around as a software engineer  Find out what you are passionate about without thinking of success  After that find a way to get successful with your passion  Always ask yourself the question   Would I love what I do  if I wouldn t get rich from it   Without passion it is really hard to be more successful than average  Don t get me wrong  average success can be enough for some people  I think he was targeting people who want to be millionaires  without being passionate about what they do ,68,

Professionally speaking  I agree  programming as a job is a bit of a mess now  That said  I think if someone s interested in learning how to program  it s well worth it  just as long as it s more of a personal expedition than one done for financial gain ,1,1
This is a truth   Coders get off to perfect syntax and comments System designers get off to perfect looking UML diagrams  However coders need to know system design basics and system designers need to know coding basics ,1,0

Well done for saying it  I said the same  on my blog  and was turned down for 2 roles because of it  Both roles were offering the same salary as I was earning in 2001  then the recruiters asked why I told young people to avoid programming as a career  Incidentally coding is a far worse career now because of all those time consuming tech tests you have to do  which test the ability to do a test or have enough time to do a test   Thankfully I am also an entrepreneur with a decent investment and side project portfolio so I don t have to put up with this junk for much longer ,2,1

 The passion for the art may not be as great as the passion for success   This is pretty accurate  I was thinking the exact same thing  You can be fooled into thinking you like something after the dopamine rewards of success affect you  but you can probably get the same thing from succeeding at any other random activity ,1,1

Software devellopment is so streamlined now that most of the time you are just a cog in the machine  It s common practice to start a project with local people who have added value like speaking the local language  same culture  knowing the lay of the lands and the laws     but eventually outsourcing the long term maintenance  As much as coding can be automatized it will be  We ll always need coders  But you need to be many other things more than a coder ,1,1

 Glory was never the domain of the programmer  it is the domain of the entrepreneur   Indeed  those programmers who succeed financially become aware of their social disadvantage  Unfortunately  the world was built by nerds  but no one  really   wants to be their friend ,2,1
He s kinda right with regards to senior developers not having to code and doing more stuff related to design  architecture  documents  communications  management  presentation  etc  But only in big companies where they can afford to hire many  junior  developers  In SMEs  the senior developers still have to code  but then  they don t pay well ,11,2

I did a degree in computer science and graduated with a first  The course was mind numbing  I worked for IBM for a while and it felt like a desk job with unsocial working hours  Decided to move to bioinformatics and biomedicine by doing a master degree and currently doing a PhD in microbiology  I would never go back to any  software engineering  job as even dirt can replace you these days even if you are an excellent programmer  As harsh this guy sounds he is 100  right ,1,0

I studied computer science around the same time as tech lead  I thought I was brilliant until I met people who could program in 30 minutes what I needed 2 days to program  He s telling the truth  It s not for everyone,47,6
what matters is the end product you might take 2 days and your software has a better chance of being better than the one made in 30 mins,1,

Amazing  I have just discovered you  I am very surprised how fast can you output valuable information to us complete free  Thanks  You re millionaire and keep on working with your time frequency  That s amazing that you could do that  I wish I could grow independently to have free time for not having to go to a job every day to support my family and be there for them  I have a YouTube channel that I recently started and seen your videos  have motivated me to continue doing content  I don t know when would I have enough views just to make 1  through it but I will keep on trying  I really enjoy what you share  Thanks again ,1,0

Another excellent video  and thank you for being brutally honest  I m tired of people wanting money from computer science   I swear I thought I wanted to program video games  but I m much happier as a writer creating game design documents and graphic novels for free as a hobby  working a delivery job  then investing on the side ,16,0

Hey  I both loved and hated this video  It struck me enough to leave a comment  which I rarely do  First  a little about me  I m currently studying for cybersecurity certifications  I m in my late 30s and I wish I would have had more positive encouragement to do this sooner  Yes  I ve always been a nerd  I started playing with Linux and coding stuff since 11  I m a female that loves math and physics  I was in engineering school  but dropped out suddenly because of unexpected health issue  Due to this  I beat myself up and I didn t try hard enough  I don t want people to think you need a PhD in computer engineering to get a job  Also involving CA  I agree  Too many people saw a 90s movie and don t understand CA in real life at all  But not all of CA if stepping over human feces and tent cities  That s only mostly true in LA and SF  Most of northern CA and the central coast is still breathtaking  To be clear  most American cities look like that now  As far as saying you may be stuck fixing some guys back door  isn t a bad thing  I m not in it for the money  a livable wage and benefits is all I care about  Cyber crime has increased 74  since the pandemic  People don t have to want to be a cyber cop  but companies like Tesla and Google are going to need more penetration testers and back door protectors  For me protecting someone s back door in honorable  I like the little black box with the acks nano ack cats  There is currently more jobs then people in cybersecurity  It absolutely can and should be a hobby  I play around with projects at home that has nothing to do with my studies  Where I agree with you strongly is people who has never written one line of code or wondering what coding language to start with  is probably on the wrong path  Obviously people should start with C  python and learn the Linux kernel     advising people to just work at a nice tech firm    meh  I worked at a VC firm as an office assistant with all the perks of the nice office environment you spoke of  It was mostly miserable  For one  I knew I should ve been with the IT crew and I had a hard time caring about my job and I was treated as a LESS  The beauty is most people can work from home now and don t have to works in some warm dusty box making 60K  Penetration testers will at least make 70 100K to start  60K in cybersecurity is the very most entry level  I do think the point of your video was to help weed people who just think it s a glamorous job  It s also very stressful and strain your personal relationships of friends that don t want to hear about it  I also think you stay in CA for more then your mom    ,1,0

What if I want to get into coding not to become a software engineer programmer but because I have a few ideas for synthesizer modules and I want to be the person who writes and implements the actual code so I can have 100  creative control  Is going the route of  Coding For Dummies  going to work out for me or is there freelance coders out there who are willing to work with me and create code based off of my vision for the modules  Basically  I m not trying to end up at Google  just have a few cool ideas for synths and need the quickest way to realize them ,1,0
Wow  the narcissism        ,1,0
That s really a lot to take  please do make a video on what other areas are there for a CS graduate  if they re really not good at coding ,1,0
Finally  someone told what everyone was thinking after yeras in development ,1,0
I think AI is a long way from replacing coding and there will always be a demand for very talented engineers  However  what s ruined the profession in the past few years is people coming into it because they heard it pays a lot of money  Here in London where developer salaries are trash I d say the quality of engineer is much higher   because people are doing the job because it s something which interests them  as opposed to a means to becoming exceptionally rich,1,0
You re so smart   ,1,0
ego ,1,0
I loved this video  It was so well crafted and really tells the truth about coding  Most coders I know become managers or higher to get out of it completely   Some of the nerds actually work on projects at home  Not many are married with kids though  Kids are way more fun ,13,0

I come here for the trash talk ,1,0
God  this one is so funny  XD,1,0
Dude is extrapolating hard  I don t recommend people who just jump in for the quick buck either  but for some totally different reasons  Programming IS dumbed down from years ago and that s because there are people making tools  libraries  frameworks that essentially turn programmers into streamline workers  Programmers in the 90s are building a house by making their own bricks  forging their own steel  making hammers and saws by their own hands while now programmers are essentially using bought tools  bought materials and bricks and pre constructed pieces to build the houses ,1,0
Bloody truth  ,1,0

The dark side is strong in this one,1,0
To put things in perspective  while there might be individual Senior Software Engineers at Facebook earning 500K a year  the average salary for a Senior Software Engineer has never been as high as even 200K  Although there might be less coding these days it doesn t really make the job easier because some of the coding effort has been replaced with having to learn in great detail the myriad of frameworks and libraries that replace the coding ,62,0

Reasons i want to learn how to code   1  i love programming  2  it helps your problem solving skills and makes you smarter 3  you can create things with it   and it makes your life flexable as well as your thinking  4 maybe i can make money with it   but it wont be a problem if i dont i still love doing it,4,0

in one sentence  he will speak a lot of sense while trolling and speaking a lot of nonsense too  And you have to pay attention to know which is which  Lol Techlead is a genius ,24,0
The flaw in tech lead s argument is assuming that the problems he worked on during his career as a SWE are going to be the same as the ones that the next generation of engineers will address  which is just not true  Sure  making an online business is easier than ever but there are other bigger and better problems now  Crytocurrency  decentralized finance  distributed systems  robotics  biotech  etc are all going to need software engineers  For highly skilled software engineers there s no shortage of demand or opportunity ,221,7
Sorry don t buy it  Sounds like you are just sales pitching  I ve heard this for over 20 years in the industry  Everything dies out in this industry  Comes and goes  Teh difference is  the competition is much greater today with the influx of international programmers  ease of remote work capabilities  and now the automation AI capabilities are better than they have ever been  This makes these new techs you are refering to very easily done by junior devs which is exactly his point ,2,
This is an excellent point  Thanks ,1,
Your comment saved me,9,
yes but you still need to become a nerd right ,5,
he s a troll  dude    you can t take him seriously ,7,
yes very correct demands change  When Henry Ford invented the gas powered engine  THAT was the problem at the time  Cars have evolutionized and people are not really obsessed with building better engines  the majory is focused on the aesthetic features of the vehicle and going from point a to b  or simply having a car while their cohorts dont  Technology is only getting more complicated and the question is  whos going to take care   advance all this stuff   definitely not this generation of pop music and song singing coke heads crack addicts  Not everyone is passionate about tech things are going downhill and it will be visible in the near future ,13,

I totally agree  I started coding at 12  because    I always enjoyed it  My passion for math and videogames surely pushed me in that direction  I ve always said  I would code even if I were a millionaire  Of course in Italy  it s not only impossible to reach 500k  it s also hard to achieve 50k  But if you love coding and your country  you have relatives and friends   maybe it s the right choice ,1,1

I love your delivery  but i understand your bottom line Im learning how to code myself right now  Im teaching myself python  I love it  Im not doing it for money only  I think its pretty fun  It makes me want to learn more languages  C   particularly  just for the challenge  Also  i work a pretty physical job that pays 45k a year  If i made 60k or even 40 k a year sitting in my basement writing code  it would be my dream  Luckily i love being on the computer and I can do it for days upon days at a time   I guess people see coding and programming as just a way to make money quick and easy  That s why there s so many people on YouTube telling people not to code or why they shouldn t learn to code  I still think for as long as we use computers there s always going to be a need for coders  While maybe most people aren t cut out to be programmers  some select are  That s where people like me come in  Just not in california though  In case it does become a wasteland full of sjw s   Good video  ,2,0
