Finance a lab to construct a new genetic wife  Cat girls could exist ,1,
Jesus said its very hard for the rich to enter heaven  Give some of that money to people that are dying or poor,3,
Dude  for the sake of your kid or future kids you need to shed the ego and find a way to reconcile with the wife  Move closer to her  beg  plead  be persistent  It may take a month or 6 months  eventually she ll come around  There s a reason you guys married each other in the first place  Old age is not something to experience by your lonesome  Btw  that process would make a great story to tell the grandkids one day  All the best man ,3,
Next video   Why I have to promote affiliate deals and courses as a dude who got fired at Facebook   Google  received several sexual harassment claims at my workplace  while I still live at my parents house as a grown up who didn t get anything done and was divorced for that reason      Self reflection videos are the best ,1,
I don t believe in divorce   But how hard is it for an influencer to get a female nerd who likes Apple  Star Trek  and coding   She would understand and appreciate how you spend long hours in front of the computer screen   What was your ex wife s major in college or former place of work in Japan  How did you first meet her  If she was homesick  did you allow her to travel back to Japan whenever she wanted  so she could visit her parents ,2,
you should teach all the teenagers on tiktok that money and fame  will not make them happy,2,
Since you don t seem to be enjoying money       why don t you give away half of it to someone who desperately needs it          i e  someone like me    ,17,
 these days I can t be bothered to deal with anything anymore      Satire or reality TechLead is a silver bullet of molten consciousness ,1,0
Lol  You sound like a stay home mom ,1,0
Here are some things you should consider  as a millionaire   honesty  integrity  empathy  compassion  truthfulness  You ruined your own life ,2,0
You need to move away from ca ,1,0
Dude  looks like money didn t ruin your life  your ex wife did    As per your story  she just complain about everything and didn t help you do anything ,1,0
I would hate to think of my life or my happiness in terms of economic value,1,0
What a maroon  smart but a maroon   If you have money you worry about a home in the country not in the city   Travel well take the heli sir ,1,1
 all of these tedious taks  bro   doing laundry is part of everyones schedule    its called looking after yourself and it gives you balance and humility  Thats important no matter how important you are and how much you are managing    No matter how much money I have one day   I am going to wash my own fucking clothes and clean my own house ,1,1
He is simply a person who lost his values  assuming he had them initially  He is right that he is probably smarter than most people because of his experience  but he fails to see that one can be intelligent on paper  and lack complete self awareness    its quite unintelligent to constantly think you are right and everyone else is wrong  Not only that  but putting yourself in this position where you wake up always believing you are above others  it almost guarantees unhappiness  I am completing my degree in Economics  but I work at a grocery store  I have learnt more from my conversations with the janitor and the dishwasher than I have from many of the students on campuses    Perspective is key,9,1
his content is half satire i thought this would be somewhat obvious,2,
Let me help you mate  I am willing to sacrifice my life a bit for you by taking some of the cash from you and taking that burden   Secondly  demonetise the videos so you don t make your situation worse  Thirdly  stop taking the mickey out of everyone LOL,1,0
I d rather have millionaire problems than the hardships you have to face in poverty     ,1,1
I see the point you are trying to make  to an extent  After watching a few of your videos  it seems to me that your perspective on life as a whole is really bitter  I hope you can find peace and contentment in life ,3,0
It is hard for many people  particularly successful ones  to admit what they are working for  sucks  But this guy did it anyway  I root out for him  TechLead I hope you become free and happy  or happier  ,1,1
First time I see someone validating my own thinking  thought I was alone    Thanks TechLead,1,1
Just forget about your businesses for a year  I think you have too much responsabilities  and that s not freedom  Let go everything you can  you can store your money of course but don t bother with it  Take a loss of a year in businesses to promote you mental health   If you really want an life changing adventure  just go to somewhere where no one knows you and know one knows your rich  Go live there for 6 months   1 year  Find a mediocre job   mc donalds for example  and try to live there with ONLY the money of that job  I really think that in that tuff situation you would make friends that don t really care about if you have money or not  because they will not know ur rich  so the people who comes friends with you will not be because of the money   and it would be an really crazy and life changing adventure   What you loose for trying  Perhaps you will find a new girl that is not with you because of the money   You will struggle a litlle but it would be good for your soul  Your welcome ,2,1
Money just buys freedom  The freedom to help the ones you care about  The freedom to help the ones that are trully strugling because they have no inteligence to succeed or to have a nice job  The freedom for you to enjoy your time  The problem is that when you achieve that freedom  you don t have anyone to enjoy freedom with you  That s because some people are strugling  others are competing for more money  etc  It s in our most difficult moments that we build strong connections  because in that moments we really see what s important  Not the cars  not the houses  not money  What really matters are the people and every soul  We all have been dropped here on earth by ourselves  Everyone is trying their best to survive the best they can  We should focus more on other people and less in ourselves  Try to help someone who is really on a bad situation because they could t do better than they did  I think you would feel happy in the end ,1,0
He could still get a normal job  Nothing is stopping him    ,1,0
i love how can u contradict yourself in every video and people still watch u   It doesnt matter the reason of the video  Awesome storyteller  u are 50x smarter than the people who follows u  Well played ,1,0

I feel you  I live in an hyperinflationary hellhole and while I had a job I would be forced to invest in real state and foreign currency in order not to see my worth vanish by itself  Not I have quitted my job and I m practically homeless  Life is simple and good  Blessings ,1,1

One of the most underrated youtube channels out there  hats off to your knowledge  I am hooked to your videos  Thank you Sir   ,1,2
TechLead  I say this in total seriousness   you need to be screened by a qualified doctor for clinical depression  Please consider doing so ,1,1
Are you serious   Still writing the heading  as a millionaire  Mate you re simply obsessed with money even though you pretend to get ruined ,3,0
send me your money that  will solve your problems ,1,0
just started following you yesterday  I watched 3 or 4 of your videos  and I all I can say is that  you are an IT talented guy  therefore  you achieved smthg relatively easy  other than that  you are a beginner in 95  of other life areas  and what it takes to live a fulfilling life  maybe if you spend as much time learning about life as much as you spend learning about bitcoin or playing videogames  you will learn a thing or two  and definitely you will be happier and less judgemental ,4,0

Ok let s deal,1,
As for me I work normal job 8 to 16 30 UK   Some time ago  rather long time ago I realized that money mean nothing to me besides keeping my family financially safe  I do not need to leave much to my children as they are smart and already very responsible so they will be able to go their own ways  My wife thinks the same  Since years I wanted to decrease amount of things I own  and currently we are getting rid of them   finally  Being owned by things is nothing new but I agree   I do not earn much  and since I felt personally insulted by my boss in the process of trying to get payrise I do not want any more money from the company I work for  Yet I am there for a long tine so I have stable job and that I value a lot   I am a happy person  yet suffering from some mental problems  currently trying to get proper help with the help of my wife  I have what I need  I hardly ever need something new really   Money are not my top priority  that s for sure   Take care ,1,0

 kinda hard to take advice from a millionaire living at home with his parents and wears a jacket with the sleeves rolled up    was a fun listen tho  ,3,0
Initially it was interesting  now I notice that it is always pointed out that he is was a millionaire and that he worked at FB and Google  Is that important  Does not matter who works where or worked and what is on his bank account  All just marketing for the  How do I become a millionaire  guide ,1,0
Omg this guy is nuts   No wonder he is divorced      ,3,2
Why do you have to adjust your living standard once you are rich  You can still drive Toyota even you are a billionaire  Warren Buffet doesn t have a premium car either ,3,1

did he write it  To me  it always comes out directly from his brain ,5,
Humblebrag   Great content  love how transparent he is about his situation  it s actually pretty fascinating,14,0

8 00 that last part hit hard with me,1,2
Money isn t everything   You cant take it with you when you die  and it will never EVER satisfy you  Money cannot buy happiness  fulfillment   and genuine friendship  Money can open more doors  but it will bring more problems  fake friends  and will tempt us to buy things that will leave us bored eventually  Shoes  games  stuff that we will throw into our closet 2 weeks later  I Love this video  Love to see people be a real human and honest  Love this video ,1,0
Money did not ruin your life   Your incompatibility with your demanding exwife made you salty ,1,0

Health is the most important thing in your life for sure   I worked two jobs last year during the pandemic for about six months   While the extra income gave me more freedom to buy whatever I like  eat whatever I love  but I could feel that my health really took a toll   In the end  I didn t really enjoy my life at all  so I quit my second job   ,1,0
Most of these problems sound like they are result of wealth  and  high expectations  Lower your expectations to basically zero and I think you re good to go ,1,0

 paul mccabe That is a very defeatist attitude  You can always make new friends and build up a new life ,1,
I mean we need money  Like he said money is a store of value  So we all need some amount of money  But focusing too much on money isn t  enjoying the journey  it s just trading your time and youth and life for a future store of value ,5,
That is his first point  Money ruins his videos too    Poor thing ,4,
Lol,1,1
This video says it all  More money more problems ,1,0
Just rock on ,1,1
At the end of the day it s all about the relationships and connections we have,1,1
It helps not to take for granted the things that comfort our lives  You re lucky tech lead  at least you had a wife and kid  better to have loved and lost then never to love at all ,1,1
yeah I dont really think the money is what bring him down  If i were him  of course id get my work done and then find a hobby or sum  Have lots of friends  Close with family  Go racing on the track with the Lambo  go to a NBA game  get a boat on the lake  find to go fund me s to donate to  It seems like him just as a person is very boring  respectfully   I think the biggest thing is family and taking those vacations  By 30 i expect myself to already have that million  saved in the bank and from their id transition from working harder to working smarter so im less stressed and make some investments and stuff  Then i can still be at the age to do fun things still ,1,

7 51  Time just passes you by  Everybody s out there living their great lives and you re stuck here  storing your value for the future  You trade your current time for the future time and hope that your future will be brighter   This is exactly what doing a PhD be like  and I was kind of hurt ballistically deep for a moment ,69,5
 jnestor481 The time goes by anyway  I lived life fully and exploited my youth  yet I always go around with some big regrets of never becoming rich or never even doing a high education  Whatever you do there will always be regrets  but there will always be thousands of nice opportunities too ,3,
Finished my got my EE degree while working full time and doing night classes  Took a long time   and yea my youth is definitely gone now  Was it worth is   Maybe not  Should have just been an electrician lol,1,
Yep  Those cursed ones who think they are blessed  Let them do all the work for their Lord and master  By all means  get that PHD and become a humble servant to the society  But life is short  maybe your only value is to improve your cognitive function  You can envy those who are partying all the time if you wish ,1,

  There s no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull  but BTCis going nuclear  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now  I d say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof ts should be the way of lifeThat being said  the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of Isaac Steward program  a pro trader who runs a training program for investors newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works  to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more bitcoin  with his program i went from having 1 3btc to 9 8btc in just 5 weeks  You can reach him on TE LE GRAM      Isaacsteward and What s   application   447782829841  let s make the best of whatever we can ,5,5

You re not even rich lol you re just well off and the rest of us are poor,2,

I know people are meant to laugh at this  but I don t find it funny at all  as a millionaire myself   Stop moaning about what car you do or don t have  and get yourself an ordinary car  How about something very ordinary  like a Ford Fusion  Millionaires actually drive cars like that in the real world   Start buying your groceries and food from middle market supermarkets  restaurants and cafes  Millionaires have also been known to do that  and some of them who actually live outside the SF Bay area even do this on a daily basis    Go and take a weekend break in an ordinary motel   as a millionaire  of course  and experience what this is like  as a millionaire    Go into a bookstore and buy yourself a copy of Jack Kerouac s On The Road and read it  If you do so  you might even be inspired to have a non millionaire  or millionaire  road trip across America and have your life totally ruined by enjoying this experience ,1,0

Oh TechLead  the conflicts you face on a daily basis  ,1,1
I m really starting to lose sight of what is and isn t satire on this channel ,1160,33
 NF N  You were right lol  TechLead catches people s curiosity one way or another  They want to hear what he has to say but also want to know how his story is progressing  Some people will mock him and others will compliment him ,1,
 Carl Drogo Its not him but you who dont understand that this channel is not satire  People are laughing cos they cant face whats really going on  Go watch coffezilla about this guy,3,
You probably lack good discretion if you can t distinguish satire from normal content ,1,
He lost everything because he lost his credibility by defrauding people ,1,
there is 0  satire and 0  sarcasm  its all real ,2,
 tatewaki11 so you are saying that he speaking truth all the time ,1,
He s a parody  but he isn t joking ,1,

 tatewaki11 He lost everything ,1,
This whole channel is about breaking down and slowly picking yourself up realizing that money isnt stand alone value in life ,9,
 tatewaki11 He don t really help himself  I used to sub but after they way he treated his wife and kids and also the way he talks like he know it all was the reasons I unsubbed ,20,
Yeah it s hard to pinpoint where the satire ends and the psychopathy begins   as a YouTube commenter ,39,
honestly lol,3,
I don t think he knows either,45,
We all are    that s the whole point  Life is kind of like that   ,7,
We re all his support system at this point  I ve been watching his videos for several years and he went from being really positive and optimistic  to trying to figure out how to keep moving forward after striving for success  reaching peak success for a relatively short period of time  and pretty much losing everything  He is an inspiring example of how life works for me personally ,138,

IDK what to say man    you just care about being ex google facebook and your money    no one likes listening these things too much at least not me    everyone would be much happy if you just concentrate on adding values to their lives instead of bragging your success    you should just focus on spreading education as you do and not the bragging    because that s the reason you lost so many viewers   ,1,1
I am NOT convinced that you are rich as a Millionaire will never brag about being so   As a matter of fact  whoever does not have money is poor but that who have ONLY money is poorer   Be yourself and believe in something more valuable than money   Cheers  Dr Walid Aly  NB  Your stories contradicts themselves as you say that you wanted a high end furniture to fit a house in an upmarket area  how does that match your claim to be a minimalist living from a hotel room  ,1,0

Taking his statements about his current life at face value  this is what can happen when you re past the point of making more than enough money and having more than enough assets but you can t take your focus off of trying to make more money and living as frugally and as financially optimized as possible   If he d put his assets into a passive or semi passive investments  spent a reasonable amount of money to enjoy life that still wouldn t decrease his networth  focus less on making more money and more on people  on himself  on improving himself socially or otherwise  on relationships  or something he truly enjoys doing  he d still be a millionaire and much happier to boot   He seems to be subconsciously focusing only on things that would make him a bigger millionaire  while it s obviously not money that needs to be improved for him to be happier from what he is saying   Money is obviously very important in life   But this seems to be a great example of the level of happiness money can buy when one doesn t focus on anything other than trying to make more money   It s a great irony that the mindset which can get you to become a millionaire relatively quickly is also one that would hinder your happiness after the fact ,2,1

 World Newbie I didn t say women were leeches in general   The ones you re talking about are leeches  not all women   If you want women who are worth being with  you have to be worthy yourself     If you think no woman is worth being with  it s because you re not the type of man good women consider being with ,8,
 Jackka82 women are women  you can t call that a leech  Since the caveman days men have provided and they tended to the household  Its not going to change just cause TV says everything is equal  sorry but reality and theory are 2 different things   The woman can work earn but generally women always spend more than men ,9,

Hire a reasonably priced personal assistant to help you with your business needs   Also hire a reasonably priced personal assistant to help you with your romantic or massage with happy ending needs   Cause marriage is like a tornado   In the beginning there s a lot of blowing and sucking  Then you lose your house  ,9,2

i love you man  the way you pull out those  ex ex ex ex  and as a millionare  i love that bruh i hope you get new wife ,9,0
7 20 This is why I think it s a bad idea to retire early  even if you have that option  I wouldn t know what to be doing with my time if I wasn t putting out some form of value some where for some cause  If you aren t keeping busy doing something meaningful in your life  and in some cases  that could be due to factors outside your control   which is a bummer if that is the case   that s how depression can grab and pull you down a slippery slope with no hope of return  As has been said before on many other self help channels  you have to keep moving  If you stop moving  you die  Harsh but true ,6,0
 whatsApp me                Thank you but I can t do two men at the same time  it s too difficult  Especially when they live in two opposite continents  It s too difficult to keep track  Though I could maybe see my grandparents in Monterey more often  but still ,1,
At lease you were friends with your coworkers  Im not even friends with my coworkers and still work a shitty job  If I ever get out at least ill be lonely with money instead of lonely without ,2,1

 Money ruined my life   Same time  this video is monetized and sponsored,847,16
The TechLead is addicted to money  He could afford therapy but with this type of addiction he won t spend money on that ,1,
Why so serious  I didn t even watch the video  I want my life ruined too ,1,
 alwaysyouramanda yea but this is more like  food ruined my life  while making a video about food while its growing in my house while doing anything I can to get more food while u watch me talk about food  Get it  some eat but some gorge,2,
Money does ruin someone  7 48 that s the real insight for the video and that ends right at 8 45 before the segway into the sponsorship but maybe it is wise to sign up for Ting  who knows someone might be overpaying for their phone bill lol,1,
No different than a video maybe called  food ruined my life   You still need to eat ,10,
 Alex V Well put  but I still think he s being sarcastic  or at the very least it s a humble brag  When he s says about all the headaches of the planning that come with your  dream vacation   he s joking  right  I d rather be doing vacation planning than sitting in a cubicle and not having a vacation to plan for ,6,
 Dan Sullivan  D you didn t get the joke of the jok er,1,
 Aniket Agarwal Too earnest to be a joke  So no  I don t think he was joking ,12,

Money has never been a worry of mine  I ve never chased it  I have been blessed to do things I love in life  I invest in building relationships  and that doesn t cost any money  It s an investment of time  an exercise in altruism  The people I have around me make life so worth living  You are a master at coding  I ve mastered keeping the bad people out of my life ,4,0
I love every moment  he went into advertising  in between of speech,3,0
Your courage and openness to share these insights with us is so admirable  We often wish to have a different life  perhaps the life of somebody we look up to  Every single person in this world is met with series of challenges  The challenges are unique per individual and when those challenges are overcome  the rewards manifestations are unique per individual  When we learn to listen to what other people are sharing with us  we are given the right perspective on our own life  All of a sudden   our own life doesn t seem all that terrible  Nothing that a few tweaks and sacrifices can t fix ,26,0
I think I see why the wife had to leave  Because the Tech lead is using efficiency as life goal when life changes comes along and require you to trade efficiency for happiness  You could have paid a ineffective premium for the dream house   overpaying  It is inefficient use of capital but happiness overall increased  I know it s not the maximum happiness per dollar spent   but losing the dream house results in zero happiness increased and a penalty on the viability of the marriage  Same with vacation  If you only had guidelines and you show up  You can plan as you go and stay longer in the fancy hotel or extend your vacation as needed  It s not the most efficient vacation but it increase happiness none the less  You got constrained by the traditional Confucius culture but didn t have the Taoist culture to moderate the condition   something regular traditional Chinese would have  Confucius  Taoism and Buddism working together for a more harmonious life   Anyhow  remember  total amount you can bring to your afterlife is zero  Wealth doesn t pass through 3 generations  And each generation need to learn to survive on their own  I think it s like an ongoing self degrading in joke that you keep referring yourself as ex google  ex facebook  ex husband multi millionare and the title keeps going longer as your life goes on and  I guess those follow you gets it ,1,0
It really is lonely at the top ,1,0
 Just remember to enjoy the journey  because probably you are running in the wrong direction      TechGems,71,1
He s absolutely right   Being in his position  sometimes you have to just stop and live your life ,4,0
Sometimes I feel like you re depressed and calling out for help,33,3
As a millionaire,2,
Some of these stresses are real even if you re not depressed  it s a ton of pressure to constantly figure out how to manage your money  He should honestly start moving at least a portion over to a wealth manager if only to reduce some of that pressure and then the rest of it is going to be getting back out there socially again  I m dealing with a lot of the same things he s dealing with but since I have my wife and kid with me they basically don t let me just sit and play video games  But it s kind of crazy how much more stressed about money I became after I got more money than I thought I d ever have all of a sudden you have all this responsibility to manage it correctly so it s like an entire second full time job  But one single bad investment with large amounts of money can mean losing more than your entire work salary that you spent an entire year earning ,3,
TBH he could be  but at the same time he is giving depression to others through his narcissistic content    Which is not a good thing,2,
 Waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and checking your doge coin prices   that one really hit me  ,74,2
i just set an alarm in the middle of the night so i dont need to panic lol,1,
I may be wrong because I m not a millionaire like you however I think there are some bitterness on how your currently looking on life  I m trying to build my wealth as well and I do see I m neglecting my family from trying to play the game of chest in life  However chest and checkers are very similar but they both supposed to be a game  When the game is no longer fun you have to take a break from it  I believe this is where you are in life needing a break  Remember making money is not limited to working a  regular job your not limited to working from home you can work on vacation and get a portion of your vacation written off in taxes  So I m struggling myself with life at the moment and I don t leave the house as well  I hope you the best ,1,0

You need to take this act on the road    too funny     You have a fun magical way about you   Keep up the GREAT work fun ,1,1
Although people might see this video as you being sarcastic  more money really does just bring a whole new set of troubles   Additionally  too much money and too much time is like IRL god mode in a game like minecraft and you get bored easily and start looking for something to stimulate you   We all need some form of struggle in our lives to help give us something to focus on   The challenge is always to make sure that the struggle you are focused on is a worthwhile one   I live a comfortable life in a well to do rural neighborhood and one of the neighbors is a many 10s of millions lottery winner and boy  I can tell you that they had a hard time of it for the first several years   Mistakes were made  to be sure   Make sure you earn what you have so you are more likely to make more prudent choices with your money ,7,0
It takes more mental energy to be lethargic and do nothing  than to do something because when you lay there on the couch you re constantly thinking of some brilliant excuses why it s ok to do nothing   Instead when you re doing what you should be doing you have no worries or stress ,13,3
this is absolutely genius    i m always depressed when i m being useless and lazy ,1,

Damn    I thought I had it bad as a disabled person from the waist down  I am kinda ashamed for all the times I complained about my situation after hearing your story   After my wife left me and took the kids I kinda felt like the world was against me and I fell in a depression  Now I see how stupid that was  I wish I could explain more  but I am only allowed 10 minutes of internet here in prison  so I would say bless you and hope you recover soon ,1,0

I know a millionaire who I used to work for and  although he d never tell me  I assume that he spends a lot of time  quite simply  not being me  I am an average  woman  single  no children  never been married  and I work a regular job  While he inherited a lot of money  I get the impression that he spends a lot of time trying to maintain and grow it  That he  tries  to see it as a hobby  but that the flavor has long gone out of the chewing gum  He once expressed that he didn t understand how the human being loses the excitement of being alive  over the course of our lifetimes  It is because the everyday  up close and personal  is not the hype we ve been fed and hoped for  Still  this happens to furry creatures  as well  You said you have a dog  That dog is likely NOT NEARLY as excited as he or she was  when they were a puppy   Although I m not in your same financial shoes  I hate my life mostly  as well  I am the typical person who  while I m happy to have a decent paycheck  apparently  I ve been quite mediocre in my life s pursuits  in addition to being held back by many typical factors in life  including a family I ve needed to part with  due to attempts at narcissistic abuse  So  I ve needed to start over  fully dependent upon that paycheck  while watching my dreams and energy slip away  and while those who are simply happy with a comfortable chair and a sandwich for life  wouldn t know WTF I m even talking about  I think it is said that everyone has their own Hell and  perhaps  that is true  As a child  I looked at adults  wondering why they don t smile and laugh more  Now  I know and I seem to know it better than my colleagues  The best I can do  is to be grateful that it s not worse because  oh yes  it can be sooo much worse  I do try to count my blessings  but yep  it can be hard  when you re bombarded with little of anything that you like or want to do   Wish I had something better to say  but I don t  If you get bored with so much money  since I ll be disinherited   you could buy me a nice  regular size house though  I am fully kidding    But  watch your one video and try  as best you can  to go after some of the things you mentioned and strike a balance  Remember that there are billions out there  who will never have options to strike any sort of balance  We have brass handcuffs and have to almost be grateful  despite the lack of options  Be well ,14,2
Don t lose hope  seek purpose and keep your inner child  It s super easy to get sucked into depressive attitudes with the world sound us today    You re younger self didn t have this outlook  When you have a dream  it makes the boring and tedious parts of life livable  Doesn t mean it necessarily needs to be financial success  but chasing your passion is the reward ,2,

Men  I feel like you ve lost a purpose in your life  Life is not all about making money    Frankly speaking it is not a very fulfilling activity   People don t really like the ones who are so focused on the money    well  maybe gold diggers do   Did you think about trying to do something for other people  Volunteering or do something else for your community  Helping others is a rewarding activity  You need to establish some ambitious goal  if you are so smart and successful maybe try find a cure for cancer   That would be really challenging and it should give you huge satisfaction  There is no joy when you are not striving in order to achieve something challenging ,11,0

It s so painful having money and literally having no friends,2,
Well  I think for some  it depends upon how much isolation you can take  I am an introvert by nature so  when I return to the workplace soon  I will take another office  to hide from my coworkers  I have absolute disinterest in the extrovert hoopla  I m there to do my job and go home to my pets  People and all their corporate problems  I have no interest in   But  what he s saying here is not  one  of those good problems  It becomes a ripple effect  It s isolating because it s hard to garner a genuine friend  He s not stuck having to be somewhere everyday  whether he likes it or not  but he clearly understands the isolation of it  Perhaps  like myself  he may feel that  the older he gets  the less he understands why he s here  as well  For me  if I m here to work and go home and to deal with a lot of crap I don t care about one lick  then luckily I have pets  because they give me purpose  I love them  because unlike everything and everyone else  they are pure  Except one of them  He s not so pure       But  sure  although I d like to have more expensive problems  from my own perspective  I m not so into my own regular problems  that I don t understand that being a millionaire can feel much like a screaming marmot  That you have  but then you don t  That there is extreme cognitive dissonance in where you stand  because the world grooms you to feel that  once you have money  you ve literally hit pay dirt   but have you   One thing my mother used to say  which she played on me  as well and why I rid her from my life is   Life is a dirty trick   It is ,6,
Best show ever,3,
The expectations are on your self  You attract people in your life who are like you ,20,2

To me Patrick should have rent a temporary apartment  with temporary Ikea furniture  to take his family unit  wife and kid  outside of his parents  But he is so cheap that he trade his wife and kid against the loss of the price of some rents and Ikea furniture  He planed to get from version 1 to version 10 of himself in one step  May be it is possible in programing  but not in real life  Several iterations are needed before reaching your dream  By the way me life is not better  See this comment as a constructive input ,1,0

I think it s interesting you say your time s 1000  an hour maybe less  But the guy who mows ur lawn for 100  10 minutes is 600  an hour  Lol ,7,4
My interpretation of the lawn service was he wasn t getting what he paid for   He would have done a much better job if only he had the time to do it himself   How many lawn services do you have to fire before you find one that is worthy  and how many years before they retire and you have to repeat the process   This is why your middle class reputation is worth more than your paycheck   All it takes is for one happy rich person to recommend you to all his friends ,1,

 ariel athomo It depends on your living style and culture  Living in with your parents does not always mean that you re depending on your parents  financially  Able to care for and help out your parents  Save several thousands a month on rent living alone in the Bay Area when we just need a place to sleep  Able to spend time with your parents because they ll be gone from this world ,5,
 B Sherman I had to move out from my parents house because of a job  I had to do it because this job experience will open so many doors because I m a fresh graduate  So yeah  I would still live with my parents but I had to move out  ,3,
 ariel athomo he s done all that and was successful now he just wants to live with them cause why not they are his parents,11,
 ariel athomo Your parents aren t around forever  If you have a good relationship with your parents it s a blessing to spend time with them  Nothing better than getting A home cooked meal and looking after the people who raised you  You have plenty of independence when they pass away ,21,

relationship in USA    or in Silicon Valley    everybody looking for money  for benefits  for excitement  Looking for  something     it is different from some countries where people want to be with you because you are you,343,36
 Piti piti USA government should really start thinking about putting people with certain income for affordable housing    This capitalism is killing a lot of people mentally and physically will never make it for first generations who comes here illegally or at least even if they make it physically will not age very well   Housing is the problem   USA should really set a good standard like Singapore ,1,
How to keep a relationship happy  Work together and mix it up in the bedroom  Sex often makes everyone happy  Why do you think a lot of women end up in long term relationships or affairs with broke men  I ll tell you  it has little to do with monetary gain  but more to do sex and mutual respect for one another  You put her in place and she put s you in your place ,1,
 it is different from some countries where people want to be with you because you are you   It sounds so delusional  1  At evolutionary level there is no benefit from being with somebody for their personal appeal  Any relationship should be in some way practical  2  I can t see why in there would be no people seeking excitement in relationship depending solely on the country  At the very least you would find those people in cities in every country ,1,

 Piti piti nothing to do with our economical system or what application you use on your phone  That is just basic animal behaviour  Every single living breathing entity on this planet is inherently selfish  We look out for ourselves before anything  And to expect anything else is sadly just being delusional ,3,
Relationships are like that everywhere now  Even places where there was genuine connections historically have changed  I moved back to the Mediterranean and it has become too materialistic there too  That s the effect of social media and the hustling get rich culture ,5,

 Connor Smiley You can be analytical and still be fun around  and no  I m not referring to being reckless   For someone who claims to be so analytical  the answer is simple  It s called getting outside yourself and being willing to make the sacrifice to do things that make the other person happy  It means not always trying to be  right   And also  when you refer to  hot  girls  that doesn t stress someone who is interested in a long term relationship  Many flaws your claims overall  You might have studied Computer Science  so have I   but you need to study some basic philosophy for a change ,15,
Bit of a broad statement  There will always be selfish manipulative people  but there are many good and wholesome relationships out there ,4,

 TechLead I started out as a graphics programmer like you  I know how hard it is to date with an analytical mind  You re probably trying to come up with a formula  There s nothing wrong with this  just know that at the end of the day hot girls will go for the fun guy rather than the stable guy so consider being the polar opposite around women to how you were at the workplace  ,15,
Even in Europe  everyone always wants something from you  there is always an interest behind    Maybe it is capitalism or social media  but almost always the thing is money or social status   ,47,
Relationships aren t supposed to be exciting  they re supposed to be like plain white bread ,191,
I like  thing you own end up owning you  I have the same thought  Do you see a remedy for this ,3,1
Well  I know the question is for techlead  but I do have a remedy  The remedy is you need to stop thinking that you own things  You don t actually own anything  Your car  house  games  PC  money  you don t own anything  You came to this life naked and with nothing  and you will leave with nothing  So don t pressure yourself by thinking that you own things  Just appreciate what has come along the way and remember that they will all go away one day  Because if you keep pressuring yourself about the idea that you own things you start feeling pain when these things disappear or go away ,3,
i think you need some friends and a new wife  And nice video btw it had everything almost like a movie  funny stuff and sad stuff i even might watch it twice xD,9,0
