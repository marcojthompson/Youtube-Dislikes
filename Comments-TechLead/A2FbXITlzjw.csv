   I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate  digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally  its hard for for anyone going against them these days  though from a trader s perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies   lnvesttors on how the community works  crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come  lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy in the market and whether it isn t too late to buy an asset  when you re hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy  a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price  bulls or bears   I trade using signals from trade expert Mrs  Susan Bossmann with her guide and signal service i  ve made over 27B TC worth of crypto assets over some months  only for crypto inclined issues    connect her on               Susanbossmann ,210,0

Netherlands wont ban crypto  If you do some research you ll realize its just one guy yelling about it,1,1
another payment of 2btc confirmed just now via the help of bithacoin mining platform they have really been so helpful to me and legit,1,1
When looking at previous reoccurring history of bitcoin  all conditions for the bulls to take full charge has been met but for the lowest band of the bollinger band which is yet to constrict the entire band to signal a sharp upward swing  Indications also show that this is about to happen so  bit will definitely keep rising so its right time to get all in but smartly of course  Its either you are great at it and if not  there are quite a lot of services offering signals  the best to my knowledge being that of Justin Wouter s  a well seasoned trader who has proved his worth  at least to me as i made over 7 btc is a few weeks starting trading his signals with just 2  Justin   Telrgram   wjustin   is very adept in TA and FA as well as analyzing the markets in such a manner that other top traders should emulate,124,7
The restrictions on  US Persons entities  are due to FATCA ,1,1
i just got 0 5btc added to my wallet just now via btc mining done by bithacoin mining platform honestly it is really a satisfying and a profitable platform i am so happy i got to find out about them,1,1
Great context  Everyone needs more than there salary to be financially stable  The best thing to do with your money is to invest it rightly  because money left for saving always end up used with no returns  I started investing in bitcoin mid November 2020 with the help of a well known  professional Mr Brook Fred and the profit entirely funded my recent duplex ,9,8

Lol  excellent  Thanks  ,1,0
why is watching your videos so addictive,1,0
Lol Techlead thanks for another good buying opportunity  Stick to coding  you have 0 understanding of trading ,3,0
 TechLead When did this become a crypto analysis channel  Were your normal videos losing viewers and crypto is topical  To everyone else watching  beware of overly bearish analysis and overly bullish analysis from any YouTube speculator  Its probably unlikely that Bitcoin is going to die now  but remember this is all a game of probability as  no one  knows whats going to happen  My BTC analysis for what its worth  not a lot but I called the 60k top   buy an amount of BTC that you can afford to lose at  11500  Yes it can get that low again  but it will likely fill the gap between 50   54k first  I ve been in this space since 2013 with all the crazy price action that has happened during all the subsequent years ,1,1
This has aged well lol,1,1
TechLead is a pretty reliable counter signal  Next time he buys into BTC  I will be selling ,1,1
Watching TechLead s vids is always a seamless experience ,1,1

you never met my sister,1,
 eckosama He s reading the news and noticing trends and patterns  Pay attention  because if Tether is a ponzi being used to buy up bitcoin  what do you think is gonna happen when they decide to dump  On top of the banning you re seeing signs of a collapse  Legacy Finance is laughing at this while ppl are saying  nah it ll be fine  ,2,
I think he keeps reading news and not about how markets work,5,
 I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Rick Richard  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 6 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy  You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM   rickrichardcrypto    ,1,4

the big difference with BTC and other commodities is as commodities like copper and iron go down in value miners produce more to off set the falling prices  yet  bitcoin production is fixed  again this guy is a tool and doesn t want to see you make money he even said so a few videos ago  on top of that I think he lives at home with his parents lmao,1,1

  Richard Bloemenkamp   There is a limitation to cryptocurrency for international transactions  Cryptocurrency is inherently slow due to the nature of blockchain   A person might have a hard time understanding this if that he she never took an intro to computer science or data structures course in university  but blockchain is essentially a linked list    In computer science  we say that linked lists take O n  time  Technically  blockchains are slower than linked lists because of the hash function used for each node in the blockchain  but we do not typically count that  So  as far as a computer scientist is concerned  a blockchain is  as  slow as a linked list  but actually  it is a little bit slower  but we are not counting constant time    One can contrast this with fiat currency  which we say takes O 1   which is constant time which means that it is instantaneous    O 1  is no time  as far as a human being is concerned     Many people cite how slow wire transactions take  but that is due to human interaction in the process   Another example is credit or debit card transactions  where it takes few seconds for card transactions to clear  but that is due to network bandwidth   However  blockchain transactions would require the few seconds of network communication  plus the time to traverse the blockchain and calculate two harsh functions per block in the chain   A few seconds is much faster than 30 minutes to an hour   Nevertheless  the beauty part of cryptocurrency is the democratization of money   Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies provide a monetary system that is entirely transparent to the world while maintaining high degrees of anonymity for its participants   The inner workings of traditional money systems  on the other hand  are kept secret from the public  but their banks and governments track participants  transactions in these monetary systems     The inherent slowness in cryptocurrency is exactly why transactions within these digital monetary systems are trusted   Central Bank Digital Currencies are not cryptocurrencies but are fiat currency but entirely in digital form   So  that way  central banks and national governments no longer have to bother with printing physical money   This isn t a situation that the normal person wants  but  unfortunately  governments around the world are working to shutdown Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and replace it with their own digital currencies ,1,
 UC2Q aFMZVzyoc cNLLlAJEw I m not very knowledgable on the subject  but anybody who is afraid of of the money press can buy stocks  real estate  commodities  gold and other metals at any moment  I don t see why you would need crypto currencies for that  World depth is indeed held for a large part in dollars and the US can theoretically  and backup with military if needed  print dollars to reduce depth  But those are existing depths  part of the past  If oil is becoming less important and Asian economies are strengthening further  there will come a point where foreign countries will no longer accept dollars for their work and goods and especially no long term loans in dollars unless there are good conditions  e g  high interest  guaranteed military protection  other    I do see the value of crypto currency for international transactions and trade ,1,
 Liars Paradox I think quite a few people agree that the banking sector and its ties with the governments are a problem and that the salaries they give themselves are totally undeserved and require and intervention  As such an independent parallel distributed financial system might a good thing  However this new crypto system appears to have some issues too  On one side I m not interested that the government bails out risk taking banks with tax money or by printing money  on the other hand I m also not interested in large hordes of people going bankrupt because they gambled that crypto would go up in value  In the latter case  in the end  that will require government intervention as well  which will again be paid with tax money or the money printer  BTW I have no idea what this has to do with Marxism or monetary theory ,1,
 ALL  governments are turning on cryptocurrency because crypto is a threat to  Marxist   Modern Monetary Theory  where it states that governments can        because the people don t get a choice     Richard Bloemenkamp   Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in response to Modern Monetary Theory  MMT    MMT has been around since Richard Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard  Since then  all currencies are backed by the US dollar  backed by faith in the US government    This phenomenon then gave birth to Modern Monetary Theory presented by left wing economists in the US as a solution for funding government projects   MMT states that a country cannot default on debt denominated in its own currency  Therefore  that budget deficit is irrelevant because sovereign currency issuing governments can always print more money       Modern Monetary Theory describes the system that most countries live under and have lived under since 1971   Governments have been steadily growing debt to GDP  and that ceiling has been guarded poorly by fiscal conservatives  In America  however  the primary camps of Republicans and Democrats are united in determination to spend trillions more than revenue takes in  Thereby taking MMT to unprecedented new extremes      The widening gap of wealth that you have seen recently is due to Modern Monetary Theory   Bitcoin was created in response to this   Bitcoin is the antitheses to MMT s thesis   Cryptocurrency provides an alternative to fiat currency      The governments of developed countries have not addressed the public s concern of rising levels of total and government debt  prolonged fiscal deficits  ultra loose monetary policies  skepticism about politicians  and other relevant decision makers  abilities and intentions  and economic growth  Moreover  since the 2008 financial crisis  the fragility and instability of the developed nations  economic systems have increased since then        Consequently  market participants will seek to preserve their wealth by avoiding domestic monetary instruments and foreign currencies and  instead  seeking shelter in cryptocurrency    As more and more people drop paper currency  a deadly inflation spiral will continue   Further cryptocurrency investment will further fuel inflation and continue a negative feedback loop that makes the problem increasingly unmanageable ,3,

As much as i enjoy these videos from Techlead  the whole point of Bitcoin is that  because of how it is programmed  one day  there will be no more than 21 millions BTC in circulation  When this happens  the price can only go up  even if the adoption rate is slowed down significantly  I am a stock investor and don t hold any coins  but i am bullish on BTC alone  I do own some shares from Coinbase though  We ll see what happens ,1,0

 Alberto Foti yuck   Your saying a dollar is legitimate Your just regurgitating whatever indoctrination they did in college  No need to show off debt and gibberish  From what I ve learned there are three requirements  we differ bc your biased as most colleges teach Keynesian BS and not free market stuff   medium of exchange  unit of account  and store of value  Thank you Interest rates and central banks are fundamentally corrupt bro  Check out economics explained video on a world without debt  they explain things pretty well   Also I d appreciate if you explain in layman s terms  as I don t speak the woke unfortunately  Finite currency is great bc it causes deflation and common ppl savings go up in value and ppl live frugally and don t buy the fcking Gucci unless they want it really bad  What happened in 1929 was due to mismanagement from financial institutions by using financial instruments like derivatives ,2,
 Y gen it is actually the opposite  Money needs to be adundant and not scarse at all  If you have limited currency you end up in cyclical crisis like with the gold standard  And these crisis result in millions and millions of unemployed   2008 crisis on the other hand was handled better because a large amount of money was injected in the system by central banks  Without central banks the modern developed world could not be possible  With bitcoin or other cryptos  this 2020 pandemic would have resulted in massive destruction and unemployment  because you can t mine bitcoin instantly in the blockchain circuit of bitcoin  and besides that  it is limited to some millions of unit  And here I am just touching the surface  we didn t even talked about tax collection  economic health analysis of the country  and a lot of other issues in a closed  decentralized method of transactions  You can have a hardware wallet with millions of dollars and you cannot be taxed  You can have millions of dollars in a wallet that gets stolen and you would have no way to retrieve all your life s savings  Cryptos are a religion  but the economists know that the direction is centralized CBDCs  digital currencies  in transparent blockchains  Decentralized pseudo anonymous blockchaines are not viable  let alone a limited currency like bitcoin,4,
 Imran A no they are not currencies  You should study Currency Theory before talking about things you don t know  A currency neeeds to have second moment variance  pretty low  needs a central bank to inject liquidity and control interest rates on this liquidity injection  and needs to be adundant  Bitcoin is not abundant  it is actually finite like gold  And with gold it went really bad  go study the gold standard crisis like 1929  I suggest Monetary History of United States to clear your doubts  because you don t know what you are talking about,1,

This is the goofiest technical analysis I have ever seen ,130,15
 Egg I would argue that it s more like a foreign currency than not a currency  at all  It is generally accepted and in use for the exchange of goods and service  Just not by all businesses  and it is not recognized as official within any geographical borders    So it s kind of like owning a bunch of euros  but Europe is in a different dimension that you can t travel to  but that s okay because some businesses still accept it where you are    The core quality of currency is that people can agree on the value and it is commonly exchanged in commerce  I disagree that it s not a currency because you have to exchange it to extract value  1  because of what i just explained  It is generally accepted as a form of payment  and also 2  Tell me how much a Euro is worth  You ll need to express the value with something    like dollars ,2,
I WILL buy Cute Blonde girl with beautiful Body when I get rich with Bitcoin ,2,

Unless a major establishment accepts crypto freely back and forth as a fungible medium it won t reach it s goal of being a currency   Everyone constantly relays the value back to USD  undermining its ability to be a currency  if you have to exchange for another currency to extract value  you don t have a currency  you have a technology and an outdated one at that   The point being  yes you will likely make money on bitcoin over the short term  but only because of market forces which could disappear at any moment  after all we shouldn t be relying on Keynesian economic theory for something you d supposedly bury in the ground and forget about for 10years ,1,

 Emanuel Schuchart there is a big difference between most commodities and BTC  BTC supply is fixed and most commodity suppliers increase production when things start to get bearish to keep there profits up or the same quarter over quarter  bottom line is this guy doesn t want to see you make money on bitcoin he even said so a few videos ago calling crypto investors lazy  but isn t he the one that still lives at home with his mom and dad lol,2,
