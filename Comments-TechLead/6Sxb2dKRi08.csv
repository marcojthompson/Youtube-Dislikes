Your thoughts on THETA,1,
I can hook you up with Richard Heart for an interview if you want,1,
You fail to mention that thousands of developers not officially working for ethereum and all building their own tools  projects on ethereum  Think about the network effects  If you think Im going to listen to a nerd like you and sell all my ethereum you must be joking  Enough said when you say you sold all that btc at  25k   ,2,

 Mewz Shick Nahh  MM is multi chain,1,
 Mewz Shick it s pegged at  1 assuming TL doesn t pull the liquidity when it s unlocked   Launching on ETH made sense back then because most defi trading volume was in ETH Uniswap  That has obviously changes with most users bridging their assets to BSC  and now Matic is slowly being adopted   Matic and BSC chains will probably overtake ETH chain soon ,1,
didn t you create MM on ethereum  what will happen if eth collapse  will MM also collapse ,5,

Gold and silver  Those are archaic thinking  Bitcoin is bitcoin and Ethereum is ethereum  If TCP IP was a company  it d be the most valuable company ever  period  Hodling  ETH is like hodling a piece of the internet s base layer  Thanks Techlead  Couldn t get a better reverse indicator than your channel  Keep it up  but i gtg get me some  ETH meanwhile  ,1,2

Admits biggest mistake was selling BTC  Advises to sell ETH  Wears a HODL shirt  ,1,2
With eth2 right around the corner   dude  you are clueless,1,2
True  Ethereum is shady trash ,2,2
Whichever service ends up being the cheapest and is simple for people to understand is the one that will kill ethereum  People don t want to have to pay 150 to trade their trade crypto or sell nfts  And people won t keep putting up with it they will go elsewhere   they re only staying bc thats where most everything is at rn and is based around  Polygon and cosmos sound like names people will flock to over ethereum  The general public will go for cosmos and polygon   whales and people who have money from crypto might stay,1,1

you blew 2 mil and eth is worthless  I m sure you ll make another video in a couple years saying I sold eth at a loss when I would have had 10 mil ,2,2
In multiple years the flaws of each blockchain will be shown and almost everyone will be able to see the difference in foundation of these blockchains  Would love to see some Cardano content  even though the space is early and the Wild West but has an insane amount of potential ,1,1

Ethereum is the settlement layer for all ETH based optimistic   ZK rollups  layer 2 s   After the merge  every time there is a transaction made on the Ethereum network  layer 1 or layer 2   ETH gets burned  The amount of ETH getting burned will be greater than the ETH getting issued  causing Ethereum to be net deflationary  In addition to this  you can stake your ETH for 5  APY now or approximately 10  APY post merge  merge   ETH network upgrade happening this summer   This is all based on automated computer code  No one on this planet has ever seen an investment vehicle of this nature ,3,2

Thought you were going to jail for promoting scams  ,2,2
Some sense and actually talking about protocols  I have been speaking of that since the beginning of my Crypto journey  People get so blinded by price and don t understand what they are even investing in ,2,0
Why not make a video addressing the proposed improvements to Eth 2 0 rather than noting that it s taking longer than anticipated  I d be interested to hear your analysis on what they re trying to do and the opportunities it could create on the network ,1,0
As soon as NFT projects stop relying on ETH mainnet  then yes  Maybe  Even then  I think you re discounting the usefulness of ETH going forward as a base layer for continuing to support tokens and NFTs  I don t believe it will ever really be cheap to transact on though  but could just be tired of dealing with gas fees  I think it s extremely unfortunate that Bitcoin BSV isn t getting more coverage ,1,0
ETH IS TRASH ,1,0
I  sold all my Ethereum   His sh tcoin is ON Ethereum ,4,2

 Why has Ethereum 2 0 taking 10  years to ship  It s taken over a decade   Ethereum 1 0 launched on July 30  2015  Interesting math  Mister Tech Lead ,2,2

The super Nintendo keyboard was coolest,2,2
What about Altera AEN  Smart project  low supply,1,0
I am a bit of a skeptic  but know a lot of aspects about BTC  So  let s make a few things straight  BTC is an investment asset   like gold  it s scarce  but it s easier to acquire it and big players like pay pal and grayscale are holding it  same with a lot of banking institutions  hedge funds and masses of people  Self host wallet btc owner whales have a hard time selling it without doing KYC and in some cases  this can wreck them financially  People lose access to their btc wallets which makes that btc frozen for all time  The Hype and FOMO is on the rise and most people only buy and hold with btc  I mean you have to understand that normal stock market fundamentals don t apply here  It s not a 2017   2018 scenario  The regulation added to BTC can actually even make it more desirable  although it has a minus   Basically  anything that could stop the mooning of btc imo would be extreme regulation restrictions and also better investment opportunities discovered by btc owners  However  it s best to find a working strategy daily signals that works well in order to accumulate and grow a very strong portfolio ahead  I have been trading with Mr Christoph Hoffmann daily signals and strategy  his guidance makes trading less stressful and more profitable despite the recent fluctuations  I was able to easily increase my portfolio in just 4weeks of trading with Christoph Hoffmann daily signals growing 1 5 BTC to 6 7 BTC  His daily signals are very accurate and yields a great positive return on investment and is available to give assistance to anyone who loves crypto trading  you can contact him on Telegram   Christophsignals  For inquiries and profitable trading systems,2,2
Toll Bridge   Nice analogy,1,0
NFTs will drive up Ether  Dont listen to this guy  he probably has 20 shares  ,1,1
And one of the biggest reasons ETH skyrocketed is because of billionaires like mark cuban putting tons of cash in it ,1,1
Why did you not bring up Cardano ADA  It is pretty much the ETH killer  I think Etheruem will have a place but based on fundamentals and sustainability  Cardano is pretty much right there on top ,1,1

Take a look at shinja they re building their own block chain by next year,1,1
Sold all my Bitcoin and bought more Tlos ,1,1
Just graduated comp sci  been trying to tell people that since August last year haha,1,3
If you sold last month or so  you made a good choice  Just buy your same position again    Trading crypto and stocks are nothing more than a gamble  And gambling can ruin lives   You can analyze the candles and charts all day  but your gut feeling can etheir make you rich  or go broke  Make a couple of wrong moves anddddd yeah   Just HODL on to your positions that you actually believe in  There s a price to pay on gains  and that price is volatility   I see Ethereum potentially going back to 1 1 5k  but what do I know  The current validators are probably going to sell off when everything is moving to ETH 2 0,1,3
One of the few that makes sense and logical in a crazy crypto world,2,3
Maker is worth almost 2 000 dollars  Why did no one mention  this token,1,3

how to buy million token          ,1,0
I think it will drop more due to concerns of Russian banning  US banning  security issues and adoption issues  But it won t be as bad as 99   Not the top 50  A lot is depending on the government policy  It s more broad market driven than individual token driven ,1,0
You must be joking   you are trolling boy   guys buy ethereum don t listen to him   the hard fork of eth 2 0 will be on the third quarter of 2022   buy ethereum   don t be stupid  ,1,0

All these ethers that have really convinced themselves that eth is in any way comparable to BTC  the only actual fully decentralized crypto in existence  always fail to mention the fact that there would be n0 copycats like eth  if there were no Bitcoin lmao Silly wabbits  ,1,1

Very reasonable points about Ethereum ,1,1
how did this dude end up working at google   was he the janitor there  ,2,1
If the People who invented TCP IP protocol hadn t given it away to the world but charged for it they would be very very rich  Had they invented a Company to to sell it to the world and had you been able to buy shares in that company you could be rich also  Had Linux not been given to the world for free along with loads of other open sauce software then lots of other people could have made money of the back of them also  So unless ETH isn t planning on charging anybody ever for using it tech it s block chain then maybe there is no money in it  But surely they will be getting a cut somewhere somehow from all this activity built on there tech ,1,1
100  agree  Blockchain is just a database  Smart contracts are just programs  There will be winner  and that company will be rewarded  But at the end of the day they these crypto plays are just a tool in the toolbox  Just like mysql and php was for facebook ,1,1
If arrogant was a person ,1,1
Many people can t handle the truth  Greed is such a motivator in crypto that it completely overrides all rational thinking or usefulness  This entire industry is aimless and  not to sound like an edgy prophetic poetic weirdo  meandering through the slums of thought on its slow crawl to the sewers of morality  What started as a thought experiment on the basis of transparent value and getting out of the banks pockets is now a giant ad space twisted into a form of perverse finance idiocracy  One day this entire space will evolve and transform into something truly useful and genuine ,1,1
Honestly I m surprised Satoshi himself hasn t dumped his supply seeing how this all has turned out ,1,
People with lower IQ overthink his messaging  This guy is totally honest and not facetious  He says what he thinks  and opinions change and evolve with time and circumstances  That s why I love his videos  he lays everything out plain as day ,7,1
Right on,1,
ETH is trash and by the way check this crypto sponsor  bla bla  oh check this keyboard sponsor  bla bla  oh check this lamp sponsor ehehe  nice tech ,1,0
If you going to invest in an opportunity  understand the fundamentals  I use to shy away from the tech jargon because I don t understand it     however  having a basic understanding of the underlying tech provides one with additional info when making decisions  Whatever you think about ETH time will tell    but this video has made me think on another level ,2,0

ETH s gas fees totally negate any gain in value it may have through coin burning  Trying to actually use it for what it is  for  results in massive losses for me  Its pointless for me so far ,4,3
Yeah I got money stuck in Coinbase wallet biggest mistake is listening to ppl who have money to lose never do that all the picks i picked myself made decent money just do research and wait u can t be positive in every coin,1,
I agreed up to the point where you said  they will be using the protocol with the lowest cost   We see the problem with low transactions fees currently happening on the SOLblockchain  Due to the low fees  it was possible to flood it with DDos Attacks   transactions  Transaction will always have a  small  but big enough  price so that DDos Attacks need more money to be executed  We will see what the price will be ,10,2

When ETH passes BTC in market cap  you will wish you d had diamond hands   ETH is indestructible ,1,1
Good points made but you discredit it with your promotion of Million token  The wallet is tied to a web browser   Bad idea  Who in there right mind would risk the security issues of an app from some unknown source monitoring what you are doing in your browser  Bad bad idea   Whoever can run a layer 1 efficiently and with high security will be the winner  They will get the layer 2 apps everyone will want ,1,1

I avoid projects on eth now  I bought all kinds of sh coins when gas was cheap now they are stuck  Can t stake them  sell them  swap them or buy more bc of gas fees  It was sort of ok to pay like 13 bucks when buying  250 worth of a micro cap on uni  But today that micro cap is worth half and the gas fees are 5 10x  Bridged one of them over to polygon omg    Bridge  gas  Now  gas  Are you sure  gas  No  seriously  gas  Ok  but we need one more confirmation  gas  Would you like fries with that  gas  How many people live at your address  gas  Will you commit to getting infinity vaccinated  gas  What were your gambling losses last year  gas  I m done with eth for now  gas  Wait  no you can t charge gas fees I was just commenting  gas  I m doing a hard shutdown  gas  I m physically writing with a pen on a notepad     gas  Ok  now I m just thinking about it in my head   gas  I ve killed myself and my ghost is finishing my final thoughts  gas  Now my coin is safely on Polygon but that was way too much bullsht   ,1,1

This guy is good for 1 thing  knowing what not to do,2,1
Not sure how you can possibly mention all of this about polygon and other side chains and not once mention that these are chains built on Ethereum mainnet  In order to use any of these side chains such as polygon  you need to bridge funds to and from ETH mainnet  The home currency on this entire ecosystem of the mainnet and its sidechains is ethereum  You cannot use any of these networks without owning ethereum and wrapping it to and from the side chains    Mind boggling to think you can mention  Most people who buy Ethereum only hold it and never interact with the network      it seems you do not interact with any of the Eth sidechains such as polygon if you can make a whole video like this and not once mention these points    Clearly this is content to push out your endorsements and shill your  unrivaled  Million coin    Shame on you bashing other  shillers  and do exactly the same yourself ,1,0

You see far ahead of most crypto enthusiasts  I ve also seen industries shed first adopted systems for improved newer systems that allow single stream processing for any  widget   However  I ll hold on to ETH until we get closer to that point  Don t let the naysayers bring you down ,1,1

when in doubt  ZOOM OUT,1,1
I don t think it s the tech at this point that keeps Ethereum alive   clearly there s better tech developed now  It s the adoption  While currently inefficient  we ll need to wait for 2 0 and see then if Ethereum has a future use or not ,1,3

I am a software developer and just joined a new company  I am currently working on a project with a different team and the Project Manager keeps introducing me to everyone as  The tech lead  for the project  I m not even getting paid extra and I did not sign up to be leading darn projects  he just one day decided it  But anyway  every time he refers to me as the  Tech Lead  I always think of you lmao ,1,2
 it s worthless  like the bitcoin you sold because you can totally predict the worth of crypto in 5 10 years ,2,2

the point of this video was basically just shilling a token and a keyboard  foolish,1,2

I ll buy all your ETH and you can go buy ADA ,1,3
I usually respect your takes  but this one was terrible  sadly   Instead of being edgy for views  or  shilling for a random coin that you most likely have a stake in  be honest with your viewers   Let s see where  million  is a year from now  compared to ETH AVAX   Polygon  ,1,0
Finally  someone is talking about how TRASH Eth is   Thank you   I ve been touting this opinion for a while   I feel a bit vindicated ,3,2
you going into pulsechain and pulseX buddy ,3,2
Finally someone who agrees that ethereum is a rat trap   The high gas fees are the glue and all the rats are the investors that just follow each other and get trapped because the high gas fees ,2,2
glad I came across your video   First person to speak fluently with technical support  and fully agree with your comments about ethereum and layer services built on it   As a cryptonewb  I ve been frustrated with trying to explore apps that run on ethereum  trying to understand about  wrapping  and if it works to transfer coins while keeping their state useful ,1,2

You should be more humble in your predictions  It doesn t have to be all or nothing on ETH or BTC  You can always hold a smaller amount ,2,2
Great content as always,1,2
Happy new year I totally agree with what you are saying   I started in crypto in August 2017  and I bought in   I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85  during the ensuing 4 year bear market   I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do   I wish I had bought more   I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience to do exactly what you have said in this post   I have learned from you and others especially my mentor Adam Joel who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really knows what is going to happen and I know you are only saying what you think will happen     ,51,5
3 different shills in 1 video  Downvoted ,2,2
It s unbelievable to me you got almost 2M subs  while you re ripping off your subscribers ,1,2
So does that mean all the coins built on the ethereum blockchain are also doomed ,1,2
This guy has no integrity    Hes says all that and then then just pushes he s coin   please don listen to this guys,1,2
looks like he s not so wrong after all   ,1,2

Hii,1,
SINCE YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT CRYPTO AT LEAST PRONOUNCE HODLE CORRECTLY     ITS  HOE DULL   THAT WAS SAID AND CONFRIMED BY ONE OF THE LARGEST YOUNGEST HODLERS OF BITCOIN IN THE WORLD  AND THIS GUY IS A BITCOIN WHALE AND LIVES IN A TREEHOUSE  HES GOT PROBABLY WAY MORE THAN THE BITTREX EXCHANGE IN HIS OWN HARDWARE WALLET BY HIMSELF  RESPECT ,1,2
Ethereum is the Internet Explorer of decentralized computing ,2,2
Remember  He created MM token  Do the opposite of what he preaches ,1,2
He s just shilling his own coin,1,2
Ethereum is meant to be a demo coin,1,2
Two points in my opinion  1  I never seen bitboy suggest the prices you illustrated here sooo   That s odd on your part 2  How come you didn t address eth 2 0  We are still very early into this space so it s impossible to know which companies are the ones who will move into the future  Given the defects all other cryptos have had eth has had a strong base given the new industry  So it s too over critical on eth specially not considering the 2 0 ,1,2
Eth is nothing   Okay    Whatever you say man,1,2
Solana is cheaper and faster than polygon,2,3
Your wearing a HODL shirt  so which is it ,1,2
TechLead  Ethereum is worthless  Web3 will not be built on Ethereum  it will be built on chains like Polygon  Polygon  we are an Ethereum scaling solution and will use its security by settling on Ethereum  People watching this video              ,1,2
You have too much ego which makes me really laugh  Kind of hilarious to me   Other than that  you people should buy more ETH ,1,2
Naw your wrong   Ethereum to the Moon         ,1,2
eth 2 does not have 10 year dev cycle  Eth launched 2015  if you cant get that right its pretty sus ,1,2
I LOVE YOUR SWEATER   Can you send it to me    ,1,2
Thanks for the input TechLead   wondering what you think of Zilliqa blockchain and its ecosystem  Any thoughts    thanks,1,0
All of this comes down to the same old question  Are people rational   The truth is nobody analyzes different blockchains the way TechLead does    It s most likely not about which option is the most rational  It s which one does better marketing or whatever else ,9,1
i love how everyone watching agrees on hating him,1,0
Hex ,1,0
I recommend Mr Corey for your trades he s the best any new investor could work with  He helped me clear off my mortgage payment trading with him and I m sincerely grateful for his assistance never thought I d see a day I made thousands from trading  Thanks a lot Sir you re truly a genuis,18,0
Initially I was not a fan of Binary Crypto trade until i decided to give it a try  Mr Corey was the crypto expert i invested my money with  since i started trading with him i have been earning massively on a weekly basis no regrets so far my mindset has been completely changed towards binary and cryptocurrency investments  I must say a big thank you and God bless you ,18,0
My journey as a trader was not funny at the beginning simply because I was so inexperienced and clueless till I came across a recommendation of Mr Corey good deeds so i decided to give him a trial and ever since then my journey so far has been the smoothest thanks to him ,15,0
TechLead did You hear about Richard Heart  Check is Pulsechain project   Looks promising ,3,1
This is serious food for thought   Not sure I agree totally but it is always important to test your investment thesis against coherent and informed antithesis   If your conviction is so feeble it can t stand up to brutally honest evaluation it s bullshit   Frankly this is a compelling take ,4,0
Speed is not the only concern of any blockchain  Speed  decentralization   security  you can only choose 2 out of 3 nodes of this triangle  And ETH does not choose speed  as of now   With ETH 2 0  it would be much faster and become more competitive  and I expected a price increase of ETH if the dev team is able to pull this off ,14,2
That sweater is awesome  thanks love you   ,1,0

you did not mention Cardano at all  Is it that bad  I do not think so   ,1,1
The recent trend is the fact that crypto currency traders can never be poor  crypto currency is the best form of investment anyone can carry out now  Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing  we always focus on losing and then investing or spending money wrongly  One reason you need to invest in crypto and its technology is because  Crypto is changing the shape of the economy of any nation that approaches technology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late  Why not look into it and have a rethink about the particular investment you wish to make now  Bitcoin has changed my life because I invest in the right way and one thing that gives me joy is because I also learn the concept of trading from a pro to accumulate and hold more bitcoin  Notwithstanding the current bearish state I still make a lot of money buying and trading bitcoin thanks to signals I receive and implement from Edward Rowe  if you d like to make extra income this January  he s willing to assist with the best signals  he can be reached on Tele gram   EdwardRowe  for advice and enquiries  happy new year,12,0
  TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems  It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC   More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  I have made over 11 btc from day tradng with FADWA  insights and signals in less than 2 weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish  ,257,6
Lol ETH is trash  Not many people understand this ,1,1
The new financial system is being built on eth  Love it or hate it  Ripple is balls deep in the documents and patents being drawn up too  Eth s going nowhere  dig deeper bro,1,1
I have a little bit for   but yeah all gone into HEX  pulse sacrifice and pulsex sacrifice,2,2
keep dreaming tech dude with gas fees at 30  per transaction theres no way that is going to just dissapear into the background,1,1
Also the entire DEFI space would have never even been created without ETH  No Poly or 99  of the defi space  DEFI was born from ETH not BTC  BTC just started the roller coaster ,2,0
what do you think about rh project pulsechain and pulsex ,1,1
Rarely seen a tech lead understanding so poorly a technology  just bought more ETH after watching this video ,22,3
Etherium is not trash  your trash  your video is trash  Please go away  Etherium has the most utility of any crypto by a margin of 10 to 1  It is the most used staking contract burning crypto mechanism with Etherium 2 0 comming ,1,1
I don t hold ETH but I can t wait for you to be proven wrong    again ,1,0
 I lost out on 2 mil USD because I couldn t HODL  Now let me tell you why not HODL ing ETH is a great call  lmao  idk why i tried to give you another chance  good luck with your weird racist scams  kiddo ,1,0
Nonsense video  This guy talks about utility and law cost transaction  and after naming the first 2 Crypto goes straight to bitcoin like  xrp doesn t exist  Since when doge is positioned at number 3   We know you are lying  Show us your wallet  U know u did the sale a penny,1,0
Thanks for the video  Good content  So you sold 18 BTC back in 2016  which is quite shocking  Dont you think selling all of your ETH could be another biggest mistake you made  lol,2,0
Does he realize DOT  MATIC ect  all have Bridges to ETH  ETH has the security the other don t  And the developers aren t against cheaper fees that makes no sense  the miners don t want low fees their the ones who are going to loose out on the toll bridge,1,0
Venturing into the trading world without the help of a professional trader and expecting profits is like turning water into wine  you would need a miracle  that s why i trade with hilder Ferguson  her skills set is exceptional ,39,10
How is her bedroom skills set    Is she a professional there too  ,2,
They promised me staking and scaling for 2018  Still I don t see anything decent in ETH  Yeah  I can use Polygon  but now there were 23B in USD on MATIC exposed due to a security flaw   F ck it  I m moving over to this Cardano  At least they have a real roadmap ,1,1
You won t regret it  I fully believe 2022 will be Cardanos year  I ve been watchin it for years and its just getting started in terms of its run it seems  SundaeSwap around the corner ,1,

 Ethereum 2 0 has taken 10  years to ship     How is that possible when Ethereum released in 2015  Ex Google techlead who can t do simple math ,7,1
Yep  Ethereum is broken  badly  ETH 2 0 is an admission that it s broken and an attempt to fix it  ETH 2 0 will under deliver  Vitamin will move the goal posts deliver half of what s promised and the ETH bois will pretend it s a win ,1,0
ETH is a special kind of garbage  It constantly does hard forks  It also has the same exact flaws as are current monetary system  Any kind of coin that functions on proof of staking has these issues  Because of the pre mined problems  It ultimately only serves the 1 ,1,0

my biggest mistake is selling my 2m matic back in 2019     got in when it wasn t even a penny,1,3

Hodling is easy if you are in right token Take a look at the token in my logo  While you holding it pays you yiled in a trustless  decentralized way  Does btc or eth do that   I just leave a dislike for the algos    ,1,1
I wish I was a google dev so I could see ow many people disliked this video ,3,0
Exactly  who even uses ETH  Its the AOL of blockchain  I also sold my last ETH in July  Better projects to deploy assets to,1,1
You need to have a interview with Richard Heart ,2,2
Yes      The Crypto industry needs more diverse opinions and synergies   Seems like a lot of backdoor paid  marketing  happening just like the legacy finance world Or the music world before platforms like tinydesk Or Hollywood before platforms like Netflix   We are fed what the 1  want in Crypto    sad  Not one comment about the incoming largest airdrop in Crypto history said here     LOL    TechLead why not have a discussion with Richard Heart ,2,
 Million token is worthless  should be the title of this video   Its not even worth  1 ,1,0
Bro the energy costs compounding over time  EVEN WITH DISPERSION    not that it would matter  Makes its almost all worthless  It does not matter if you are right  Preference MAKES the whole market  Thisis why too smart of people have issues with the market  ITS ALL MARKETING  Its a full on popularity contest ,1,0

I appreciate your honest bud  I really love xrp and holding long ,3,1
You seem extremely smart and I know that you know what you are talking about but  idk if you keep mentioning Million Token because it s actually a great project or because they are paying you to mention them,1,0
Your missing Pulse Chain Richard Heart is forking Etherum and the whole system state nobody else is doing that,1,1
If Ethereum is trash  then your million token is a petrified rat turd ,1,0
Being right at the wrong time is same as being wrong  Yes  probably one day all L1s will be commodity and they won t see nearly same price appreciation as application layer protocols  However today we re just seeing L1s being built up and compete with each other and ETH is the surest bet if you really want to HODL for long term ,39,8
If they hold fees high or higher than right now  Ethereum wont be on mass adoption which won t move the price beyond 5 10k   yes it worked on Bitcoin and Satoshis but it won t work on Ethereum because you also pay gas for transaction ,2,
Appreciate the info  and you sharing that 2016 Bitcoin sell of 38 coins   None of us could have known the future that it would be worth  2million  If we did  we would have all sold everything to buy BTC  Either way  we share your pain ,1,0
The layer 2 networks have security issues because they aren t as decentralized so right now at least with proof of work it makes ethereum valuable but I m not sure what proof of stake will do to this situation I don t really understand how the nodes will process transactions with proof of stake vs the current network  Surely not every staker is running a node it s gatta be delegated to huge processing centers right  Id like your input on this,4,1
Dare to do it different  Good decision  If you have made mistakes in the past and now you are being criticized  then good for you  it means you have achieved something remarkable  so don t allow others who have done nothing to judge your mistakes or achievements  Congratulations to you   ETH has been interesting up to 1000   1600 USD  from ROI perspective  Since then we have a lot of options  major projects have emerged that from an ROI perspective have left ETH behind  EGLD  SOL  AVAX and especially KSM  ETH is like a muddy well from where you can t get a good drinking water at a decent price  it s a boat with multiple repairs that will sink at some point ,7,0
I like how everyone is roasting him lol  when he just gave atleast some nice min lesson on platform dev,2,1

you are very informative and it is true that you cannot use ether due to high gas fees   what do you think about cardano ,2,2

What do you think of Hex and Pulsechain ,1,1
XRP is the real deal if there is one in the cryptos,1,1

 Why I sold all my ETH    Said the guy who sold 35 BTC for total 20 000 USD  Thankyou for tip  just going to increase my ETH holdings now ,1,1

TechLead  don t even let ppl use diss like bottom as u have much more diss likes then likes u should be in Jail,1,1
LOL  Does he know that he built Million tokens himself on top of ETH ,1,1
Ethereum will have value for the people who are investing now as a crypto currency  It is a fact that Ethereum as a base will being completely unnoticed many years from now in a decentralized world but the people who got in 2021 2022 and maybe even 2023 will be able to profit big on their investment  but in later years it will just become a building block for many many decentralized apps that people will use on a day to day basis like HTML etc  rather than a valuable token but  I think we are at least a few years away from that and that Ethereum is still profitable,1,1
No one TRUSTS YOU ANYMORE     SHAMEFUL   ,2,1

I m still waiting on the million token Swap DEX with multichain bridging for all crypto assets   Perhaps you should consider creating a fork of the polygon network  as well     That wouldn t be too difficult for a x Google tech lead ,1,1
You  can t even keep to one or two themes  you are all over the place  You lost me   especially with the 2 million dollars you would have had ,1,2
Hahahahahahahaha        Good one     Im buying eth right now   ,1,2
What happened to million  Ah so you re clearly an expert,1,1
He sold pump it,1,1
The technical aspect was well explained  however what he simply missed is that the community now buy and hold ETH for the entire cryptocurrency s eco system  This technical aspect is insufficient or almost irrelevant in terms of selling Ethereum  If we all drop ETH or BTC  your altcoins will mean less than how much ETH and BTC will drop  In time  the spread of crypto market dominance will occur by itself and I believe it should really have to go this way  So  I think the point is incorrect or irrelevant  Technical aspect and explanation is informative though    ,9,1
Again  what about Hex  pulsechain pulsex  ,1,
Google is nothing I don t even use Google for University research  Got etherum for  10 HODLING EASY ,1,1

Why don t u talk about XRP the true king of Crypto,1,2
all values based on market share and market share is 2 things  power   influence  both are accumulating things thorough time  we don t use actual gold but the gold still valuable to us because of its true share among physical commodities  the big failure comes when the technology shifts  and that shift obsolete the current at the hardware level,1,2
I don t like ETH either  It s only expensive and slow as f     Nothing more ,1,2
The Ethereum developers want to decrease gas prices  This guy is a liar  Why is L2 such a big topic ,1,2

this dude is not tech lead anymore for many years but still mention it  lol,1,2
this network stack analogy is so terrible    but piggybacking off your statements  Ethereum is wildly valuable  I m sure you re familiar with Cisco  Aruba  Arista  or Juniper  Why would Ethereum not evolve teh way those companies did ,1,3
You made a mistake of selling bitcoin  So why would anyone listen to you about ethereum ,2,1
Are you familiar with the qfs or quantum financial system that is supposed to be switching over to   Has to do with nesara gesara  Love to know your thoughts on how it may effect cryptocurrency  ,1,2
Starts off bashing bitboy      ,1,2
Anyone with half an ounce of knowledge knows  no one knows the future  You can only place many bets and hope you win some  The only thing you can do is bet on good tech  Cardano  ,1,2
This will age badly,1,2
you got paperhands LOL  Everything you said from start to finish made absolutely no sense  Even if Eth 2 0 causes the price to drop then short eth and you will make money  Or lets hope you do ,1,2

INTERNET COMPUTER PROTOCOL WILL OWN THE CRYPTO MARKET BY 2033 ,1,1
Lmao  Polygon  FTM  Avax arent Eth layers  Since you don t understand the difference between a sidechain and layer  its not surprising you also don t understand why the vast majority of value in defi end up sitting on Eth  Cough  Network security    ,3,2
The reason the devs dont go wild on changes in Eth is because there is 400   B I L L I O N dollars at stake  they cant just change the engine of the airplane mid flight without extreme risk assessment first  Also Google will never become the most popular internet search engine and data provider   Microsoft wont become the most widely used OS maker  and Amazon is just a bookstore ,28,4
You may say that but honestly in this field things move faster  Empires gather and fall,1,
Aint this guy in jail ,1,2
Aren t you tired of being WRONG    Maybe ETH won t survive for long but even understand SMART CONTRACTS and their value ,1,2
Yeah  Ethereum network wanted to charge me like  100 fees on a  70 swap  Polygon charged me about  0 02 ,8,2
Ex google ex Facebook doesn t make you an expert in crypto  brother,1,2
You need Ethereum to mint NFTs so yeah  ETH is worth something,2,2
I just keep staking  over and over     Otherwise I start to hear a tiny little voice that says  just sell some  just a little bit      ,1,1
You re making a big mistake  Warned  You ll massively regret selling Eth  especially heading towards 2 0 and the fact that it s a deflationary asset  plus huge utility ,4,2
Thanks for the video  you hit the nail on the head ,1,1
He is wrong again,1,2
Thanks for being a part of a supportive community  Helpline  ,1,

When someone leads their argument with their former titles and accolades instead of the actual substance of their argument I get a little suspicious    You might even  be right about eth or whatever but it just feels like you are waving your hand and muttering  don t even think about it   I worked at Google   take my word for it   You could follow your intro with the  most solid  air tight argument but it will always smell stinky because of the intense fart sniffing you did in the first 30 seconds   Oh yeah   I just bought more eth,2,2
techlead does not top you being a Fool   ,1,2
Hi tech lead from uk    I ve been watching your video for a while now  I have confidence if your knowledge and expertise   PLEASE MAY YOU HELP ME  I ve recently invested all the money I afford into a nft project on Xmas day eve  But a developer programmed a backdoor into the minter and Stole all the presale money   I 100  BELIVE IN THE PROJECT AND OWNER    he say stood into of the problem and wants to rectify for the people and project   Can you help  Please I will go into further detail on another platform   I HOPE YOU REPLY   THANKYOU,1,3
ex bullshit,1,2
This is so wrong on so many levels  Current direction of ETH is to become internet money to the detriment of new and emerging apps  Agree with the prognosis  but analysis of the sysmptoms is wrong  ETH is currently looking to displace Bitcoin more than anything else,1,2
This man makes terrible financial decisions,1,2
This guy should name his channel vice versa ,2,2
Maybe Kadena ,1,2
 aaa moon rabbit layer 1 blockchain,1,2
Dumb video  Don t listen to this guy  He has good points  but his overall vision is wrong  Just fyi  Matic polygon runs ON Eth  ,1,2
I need that shirt ,1,2
You ve demonstrated complete stupidity at best  Ethereum will run strong into 2022   If for no other reason than the hype behind the  Merge  combined with ongoing token burns from EIP 1559  it has a VERY high probability of further upside  If the crypto market goes up and BTC breaks approximately 54k for continuation there will be a ton of money to be made  All eyes should be on that BTC level not Ethereum  The only way for Eth to fail is for the whole crypto space to have a bear market    that would have been a more logical argument ,1,2
Look into KDA,1,2
I don t understand his view on Ethereum price falling when it will upgrade to ETH 2 0   Why should price fall  it will bring even more adoption with ETH 2 0,1,2
buy HEX PLSX and PLS       that will be a great place to be  ETH can t get its miners together to scale,1,1
Lmao this guy just lost all credibility when he started shilling million token ,1,1
Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list  in some months time you ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today ,3,0
I only clicked just to have a look at your sweater  finally something different   Hehe   Nice theme too with the Christmas keyboard ,1,2
Uh   ETH has literally been the only true consistent crypto the past year     And 2022 will be explosive ,1,2
There was an nft drop a few days ago  Costs  03 eth  But the gas fee to mint at that time was 2 3 eth ,1,2
Oh yea and your just looking for views it s so sad the sheep that believe people who say anything,1,2
Just buy gold  guns and ammo ,1,2
At some point Ethereum and Bitcoin will fall   Neither one represent an actual practical currency   Hopefully  2022 will be the year when Crypto value is based on function and not on hype ,5,6
Fall in value  Very possibly  But BTC for sure will not go away  2 Countries have legit adopted it as there currency   lol  Its always being traded and used ,1,
I ve never seen so many bad calls on one channel,1,2
Truth ,3,2
As a millionaire,1,2
Why ,1,2
My dude claim to fame is he s an ex Google tech lead ,1,2
I think these IT tech google  Elon silicon valley guys full of crap  All these ethereum things like polygon chain link etc  etc  are complete rubbish  They don t scale  their fees are crap  The only thing that can do what he wants to have happen is BSV  Its been conceived by Satoshi  Cheapest fees and highest throughput  Its proof of work as its green  The block subsidy is coming to an end  Fees on millions of transactions will be the future  microtransactions fractions of a cent is already possible on 100k tps BSV ,1,2
I am glad you have come out and said ethereum is junk  BSV is the only coin that has utility,1,2
ETH will be the clear network effect winner once ETH2 brings the 100x speed up and zkrollups bring a 100x to that ETH2 100x,1,2
Alien   Crypto https   youtu be 3154OFu5xmU MUSIC,1,2
How does this guy have a million subscribers ,2,2
He has lost his mind,1,2
This guys a joke must be a tool who likes the asia government  If you want to be poor do what he says  ETH is the most staked crypto  News flash everything is mostly built on ETH ,2,2
This guy doesn t give a   about the content he posts as long as it s controversial and gets him a lot of YouTube views ,2,3
I m Booollllisshhh on you ser  that s why I m boooolllish on MM,1,2
 I totally agree with what you are saying   I started in crypto in February 2018  and I bought in   I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85  during the ensuing 4 year bear market   I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 3 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do   I wish I had bought more   I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience to do exactly what you have said in this post   I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor KEITH B JERRY who taught me how to make trades and increase my crypto daily  ive went from 4btc to over 12btc in few weeks   no one really knows what is going to happen and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past   It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research   ,47,9
 Rezaile Time So all this comments are fake as well  I contacted the guy and seems like really good deal  How did he took the coin from you ,1,
Not true  this Keith guy stole my Crypto  still trying to find him  Don t care about any gains anymore  just want my crypto back         ,1,
nice  how can i meet him ,1,
I wish I can watch this man sell his eth live  Also  I wish i could block users on YouTube ,3,3
What Happened to your million token  Your advice is terrible I just bought more Eth,1,2
I HAVE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRADING MYSELF   I THOUGHT TRADING ON DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET    CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST ADVICE ME ON WHAT TO DO ,63,11
My advice is don t type in all caps ,1,
 Kelly Michael what s her name with that watsapp number ,1,
Buy high  sell low,1,
If you actually want good advice  DO NOT buy cryptocurrencies  it is a gamble  And do not listen to TechLead  he does not actually know the market well ,1,
Trade with smaller amounts so emotions don t interfere   Or just buy things like eth Luna and avax and just hold,2,
             Trade with her and remember to share testimonies with others,1,
             Trade with her and remember to share testimonies with others,1,
Trading with an expert is the best strategy for newbies and busy investors who have little or no time to monitor trade,2,
Hey  have you heard of HEX   Please research on it and give us your technical view on it ,2,2
Despite the recent bull market  most traders still make complex mistakes while trading alone  I would advise traders to get more information with the help of experienced traders  Rhett Susan is a game changer ,1,5
This man fails to look outside of his own perspective and reflect on himself before making big statements ,2,2
I have a small holding of eth but yes it has issues   It has a first starter advantage over other smart contract platforms but Cardono is going to eventually steal its market shares if they do not fix those problems ,2,3
 Gas fees are simply way too high   That is a myopic view of Ethereum ,1,2
What about Solana ,1,2
SOLD THE BOTTOM  LMAO,1,2
This is not going to age well   ,1,2
Dud google fire you  Weren t u the janitor at google ,1,2
TechLead is one smart dude  He knows how to emotionally control people who don  like him  That is POWER  LOL,13,5
That s exactly the point  They already lost  These people are not crypto investors  they are crypto die hard fans  They re emotionally invested and most seem to have no concept of anything beyond  buy low sell high    If a youtuber can play them like a fiddle  then so can any shark with the stomach to leave them bag holding ,1,
One word  Luna ,1,2
Ethereum wanted  600 for an  80 transaction,1,2
Agree eth sucks,1,2
This guy s getting blocked,1,2
This guy said I m ex Google ex tech lead  now we know why gave the most awful advice then showed us how u lost money in bitcoin what     Lmao worst trader don t be this guy,2,2
He told us to sell it  so he could buy it cheaper  The audacity ,1,2
Smart guy over here  The fees are high on ethereum and 10 years from now you don t know if they will still be there  Watch HBAR  ,3,2
Thanks for being a part of a supportive community  Helpline ,1,
Hi,1,
harmonyone,1,2
While TechLead is nice to watch and you might learn something as well  there is a catch to it  If you don t have a prior basic understanding of the subject it s hard to tell when he actually markets a product based on possible financial reasons and not on specs ,57,5
He is being paid to promote different projects and pump his doge coin   Did you notice how he moved from naming the projects from 1 2 and then straight to doge ,1,
The amount of horse  sht  coming out of his mouth       ,1,2
Didn t age well  Don t take investment advice from a programmer,1,2
Best troll ever,1,2
I think you are really unhappy with your life  It makes me sad  I hope you get better one day and find something that makes you laugh ,1,2
this has to be satire crypto news    impossible to be so wrong      dude ur very funny ill sub for the jokes,1,2
It is a network which made all this possible  This guy is making the next biggest mistake of his life  P s  are you even Asian  Or some kind of imposter ,1,2
Sold at the bottom LOL,1,2
Best tech troll ever ,3,2
This guy is as sarcastic as they come  Entertainment only  Don t do anything he said  He started his own meme coin also that is designed to get him rich with your cash   Teach Lead  Big mistake   sold my BTC  Also Tech Lead  Sell all your ETH ,1,2
Guy is the biggest troll   Do the opposite of whatever he says ,1,2
Look at  IOTA ,1,2
Million doodoo    ,1,2
As an ex big tech engineer myself I can report that  tech lead  is generally not an official title  It denotes an engineer who owns a particular feature or project but isn t a personel manager  It might be good to put on your resume but I wouldn t be boasting about it on YouTube because it s not saying a great deal ,7,3
He sold  PUMP IT ,2,2
TechLead  My apologies for being rash  However  why would I take advice from someone who sold all of their Bitcoin too early  I own 33 ETH and I won t ever be selling it  Did your short position on Ethereum get wrecked  Good ,1,3
I thought the bear market was 7 months ago you said    ,1,2
nice sweater dude ,1,2
This guy doesn t have a clue about Ethereum  Listen to him sell it to me   Bitboy you and all the rest just use click bait to steer people wrong  Get lost  ,2,2
Ethereum is worthless but his scamcoin is good lol,1,2
New strategy buy what he sells  ,1,2
Please check IOTA,1,2
But the application code needs ETH to run,1,2
the issue is this market is not driven by efficient technical solutions,2,2
why does he have to add   ex Google tech lead  in the title  lmao,1,2
hey do you know that polygon is simply one of the the layer 2 implementation for eth ,1,1
Man your ex wife must be so happy she doesn t have to deal with you anymore,1,1
i love the part where he sold all of his bitcoin and regretted it and learned from his  greatest mistake of his life probably  and then turned around and sold all of his ethereum  I am sure it will work this time blech lead and thank you for knowing everything about this compared to anyone ever  typos intentional but I could have done better with capital letters and general punctuation ,14,3
good thing he sold HAHAHA its down 50 ,1,
What a tool,1,2
Yes  Million Token  right  Stop trolling  Many people will believe you  Ethereum will probably 4x  at least  in the next 3 years ,1,2
Dogging Ethereum and mooning his Million token 09 32   what team of people is actively working and intentionally focusing on Million token   what s the roadmap timeline ,1,2
He s a Chinese spy   I would not trust this guy,2,2
What is anybody s thoughts on Hedera ,1,2
No  as a millionaire  in title   Wow im impressed   baby steps my friend   baby steps     ,1,2
this is the reason why you are still a millionaire and not a trillionaire,1,2
I like Polygon  It s is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum  The transactions occur off chain  but are ultimately settled on the main underlying Ethereum chain  I like your spicy take on the reasons for the delay in deploying ETH 2 0 ,26,7
No lol polygon is just a side chain,1,
please shut up  and do not tell the people what they should do,1,2
but you still pay a small fraction of eth on layer 2 transactions  So that only imply eth will continue to provide the utility of gas fees as adoption of layer2 increase and so the number of transaction ,1,2
TechLead is knowledgeable with application development  But his understanding of where Ethereum will be 5 years from now is flawed  Just as his prediction for BTC was wrong ,7,3
You listen to him for fun  you are ok  you take him seriously   you are dead,1,2
Plenty of items are better than the next but people like the buy the name  The ETH name alone is worth several billions  Many people will buy it because its ETH ,1,2
but why not just hold ethereum and avoid the mistake you made with the 38 bitcoins  just hold and move forward    ,1,2
Enough about crypto and tell us where to buy that sweater     Thanks for all the trolling  if ever in Croatia  I m buying you a coffee   a proper one  not that instant stuff ,1,2
you are wrong  as a millionare ,1,2
polkadot will take its place to 2th under bitcoin,1,2
Hold up  When did etherium become litecoin ,1,2
NEO is the best tech in the world  Best do your research asap,1,2
Hello  where did you get that amazing sweater ,1,2
BAHAH this guy is the WORST crypto channel YIKES,2,2
How can you you say ETH is worthless but is going up all the time      But yet you premoted your Million coin which went straight to the toilet,1,2
Should not make videos like this man  could easily make someone take this seriously and sell all their crypto  ,1,2
This guy admit his biggest mistake in life selling 20 BTC in 2017   Now the second biggest mistake he is doing is selling his ETH    ,1,3
and before that he was the dude who lost a shitload trying to be a day trader lmao  This guy is too smart for his own good  he moves too quick ,1,
Wait  dude  I thought you exited crypto a year ago   Shut up already ,1,2
Bitcoin is the only option that I continue to buy on BFX ,1,2
Actually you are very wrong about conflict of interrests regarding ethereum  Devs will have interrests to lower fees because they know they will attract all consumers on the network  so    more people will use network  for each user will be getting a small fee for using network  but scaling to large user base  the network usage will be huge and all miners later stakers will get probably even more ethereums to contribute to network ,1,2
ETH is being replaced as we watch ,1,1
interesting that you have such a large following  yet as I m reading through your comments  Ii seems that your negative comments put a shadow on you positive comments      Please explain,1,1
one of the best things about this channel is that you never know if the techlead is joking or not,244,13
That s because he is bi polar and doesn t know that himself,2,
Schr dingers youtuber  He is both an entertainer and going to prison at the same time ,2,
I really thuogh that he was joking some times  The more watch him i slowly realize that he hasn t made a joke in his entire youtube career  he is actually serious 100  24 7,8,
 Snowball Effect you convinced me  I m buying 200k Million Tokens,2,
 jahsilent1 nah  he s entirely serious  he s a major shill and totally full of himself with a distinct lack of empathy ,17,
 Carl Ruppert he has to be doing satire,2,
 Kevin V  if he s really joking  then I m certainly not amused ,1,
your a con artist bro ,2,1
Been saying this for months  I refuse to do anyhting on etheruem ,1,1
 ,1,1
Truths mixed with shills  Difficult to assess unless you are on the ball  Still entertaining if you like this kind of stuff ,2,0
The Market Is Bad Right now  Everybody is Practically Crying  It keeps dipping  That s what you get when you feel you can navigate the process on your own  Big thank to William Henry Morgan   I m not bothered with how bad the Market is because my assests are insured due to his advice and I still receive my profits ,50,4
Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it   Show me a man who doesn t have an investment and I will tell you how soon he ll go broke   Investment is building a safe haven for the future  with the right choic of investment that has at least 1  minimum risk and with an Expert guidance  profit and interest should be   guaranteed ,26,14
Hey TechLead I got a sincere question for you  were you able to make any friends while working at all those illustrious companies  Or when you left they did nt want to hang around with you anymore  Is making real friends possible at all those companies lol,9,1
Ex fb Google    If the Rucker is so good they will pay him millions for him to stay    complete bs wasted 3 mins of my life on a China man who can t even speak properly,1,1
Buy KADENA  KDA ,1,1
I do agree that if ETH 2 0 doesn t resolve the high gas fees  it ll be a slow death starting in 2022  I agree that platforms will just use whatever blockchain is fast and has lower fees ,2,1
At least he knows how to involve us to get more money from youtube and buy more eth in our back ,8,1
Excellent piece   I have long doubted that Ethereum was the horse to back but was never brave enough to say so on any forum   surely these are the killer Ethereum facts about what is only a 2nd generation technology   keep up everyone  we are now on 3rd generation technology  ,2,1
THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE IN MY LIFE WAS INVESTING IN FINANCIAL MARKET  TRUST ME GUYS  IT PAYS ,8,6
 Briana spann Please what are the requirements to get started in bitcoin trading and how much is his service charge to help me trade and make profits ,1,
 Johnbosco Peterson I came across him on Twitter  bet never knew he was this good  just happened I met him and decided to give him a try ,1,
How does this whole Bitcoin thing works  I m interested in it and willing and ready to invest heavily but I need an assistant to properly guide me through on how to make good startup and be successful in it without making mistakes ,2,
He helped me recover all I ve lost trading by myself ,4,
Many of us don t know where to invest our money so we invest it in the wrong places  and with the wrong people,5,
You re right  to be a successful person in Life requires him or her hard work and time,7,
ChainLink  ,1,1
Agreed  ETH is straight  trash   Costly  friction loaded  slow  outdated   still on PoW consensus ,1,1

Ex Google   ,1,
At 00 07 21 you say    ethereum 2 0 has taken 10  years to ship    What are you talking about  Ethereum went live on 30 July 2015  about 6 years and a half ago  What 10 years are talking about ,1,1
Ethereum 2 0 ,1,
BSV is the  only  blockchain that works  you were warned,1,1
He is  selling  while wearing a  HODL  Christmas sweater    ,184,9
Second layer level trolling ,3,
I assume that s meant as a subtle joke  That along with   Selling bitcoin was the biggest mistake of my life  So  I sold all my Ethereum   lol,3,
lmao,1,
Let s not forget about million token  smh,2,1
He completely ignores the fact that many of these projects  Polygon  Arbitrum  Optimism  are build ON TOP of ETH  which still means ETH is a necessary base layer   I personally don t own any ETH  but I recognize it is a solid and battle tested base on which to build ,733,58
 J B Gas fees won t get lower that much in ETH 2 0  that idea is just a myth  but it s true that speed transaction will get better ,1,
But see ETH isnt solid  The fees enough are why ETH is on its way out  Then there is sharding which they havent done yet AND Eth 2 0 isnt done for at least a year,1,
Ethereum as a technology vs Ethereum as a network needs to be differentiated ,1,
 WYDELL ARMSTRONG  Eth wont release eth2 0  becaus eit could cause the price to tank    No  I think he meant that it has taken 10 years to release Eth 2 0 and it shouldn t have   They should have released it 3 years ago to maintain their Metcalf s law advantage  but they are releasing this spring  3 years too late because the original Eth is far too profitable for those collecting gas fees ,1,
a solid battle tested base    you tryna build on sand  eth has hacks all over the place  centralized  and broken  its a yolo developers sandbox ,1,
Etherium will go down  Even if gas fee lessen  It is the tech that it promise  Imagine saying it is decentralized  And yet the author is constantly changing the structure of the coin without asking the community  As if the sole control of the coin is on its author only  It is decentralized ,1,
 J B Ethereum has been hacked multiple times and no one talks about it  Solana is brand new tech and has mostly sustained itself amongst millions of users while being faster and cheaper     Eth is not sustainable with those gas fees and everyone says  Just wait for Eth 2  when they could just invest in something that s already solved the issue   Eth was never meant to do what people are using it for  so I can t blame Eth itself  But saying Solana isn t secure enough is a streeetch ,1,
 J B Why would you invest in Ethereum when Solana exists lol,2,
 B Gavin  Is this legit  I talked to him  he explained to me everything  I did trained with him  but I am not sure if I can proceed it ,1,
I don t think he even understands that  this guy has no clue what he s taking about ,1,
 Rob Mac The update has been delayed because they were troubleshooting on the beacon chain  They have actually moved on with phases so there is notable progress   It ll come eventually  and with it the technology will see increasing adoption from various institutions   Big banks are already running tests to implement the blockchain tech internally for their customers  and so far eth has been the clear winner   Personally I am hopeful  Once eth 2 0 comes online it ll boom   One thing that is not very well known  Amazon has opted for IOST for its APAC services   It seems like chains are really seen as the tech of the future by big banks and tech corps ,1,
 J B The ETH team is leaving member by member  Moving to proof of stake means it s no different than AVAX or SOL just slower with older tech ,2,
 Antiteshmis I guess but it was supposed to arrive about 4 years ago from memory And when fees are lowered it will bring the network revenue and probably price down with it Plus eth stakers will be able to unstake their eth and sell,2,
And Eth2 0 is coming  promising insignificant transaction costs ,1,
 Ai Elrond eGLD,1,
let be more specific please   all security of all layers relies on eth  nothing exists without eth  so few people understand this ,3,
Etherium gas fees are crazy  You wonder where this money really is going  Polygon is  built  upon ETH but performs better with lower gas fees ,4,
  J B thats exactly what he said about eth,1,
 J B BTC was hijacked  BSV is the real bitcoin and does 100k tps,3,
coff coff said kadena and elrond,1,
He said that haha  Eth wont release eth2 0  becaus eit could cause the price to tank  So most people wont use eth for much since the gas fees are higher  unless they release 2 0 but they still havent  Hes explaining these are the chains  reguardless what they are built on  that this is where it s most likely to be profitable functional for more people   If I m understanding the video properly  ,4,
He is just a delusional parody  Guys taking him seriously are real fools here,6,
BAHAH this guy is the WORST crypto channel YIKES,9,
Dude started out by saying he sold  a bunch of btc that could ve got him two million  Def not taking financial advice from this guy  eth is king  Flippening awaits,22,
 Alex Leung what layer are speaking of  Just curious  ,3,
Polygon  Arbitrum  Optimism  all highly centralized  I want an L1 with trustless nodes  low fees  high tps  not a broken L1 with centralized L2s which can t compose with each other ,15,
THat s his name in  TE LE GRAM ,1,
clintMorriSON,1,
Doesn t even seem to acknowledge that Ethereum is moving to proof of stake and utilize scaling strategies  which will lower gas fees and increase transaction speeds  The Ethereum foundation is not just sitting on its hands like the Bitcoin community     But that s kind of the value of Bitcoin  you can trust that it s not going to change but with Ethereum it s valuable because it will innovate ,54,
TechLead is trrash ,3,1
This video is why Cosmos is the sleeping giant   ,1,1
Selling lights  eth crap,1,2
You sold BTC at  25k  That s all I needed to hear ,336,14
But he knows the tech  bro         D,1,
 GB That s so funny  ETH 2 0 is not a big deal   Better investments are surpassing in importance while you gas lovers learn the pain the hard way   Just because he sold at a loss has nothing do with why he s right about eth    Following stop loss rules means he had a strategy and was man enough to admit it ,3,
Hes the troll king  Can t stand his videos,15,
No  he sold Bitcoin at a loss in 2016  That s even worse ,29,
And still is confident     ,12,
Ethereum 2 0,2,1
I used to watch his clips but at some point I realized he is just playing with narratives to be controversial and attract traffic  I unfollowed him but YT still suggests his clips  It s actually first time I m looking for  mute  or  block  feature on YT  To cut off noise narrative manipulators and focus on good content   ,1,2
Tech lead  take care bro  I just noticed that your physical appearance has changed a lot since I followed you 3 4 years ago ,1,2
Loopring layer 2 is the solution for ethereum  He should be knowing this,1,2
I clicked don t recommend channel  ,2,2
Hes just doing this so peeople can sell their etherum prices goes down and he s able to buy them now,2,2
I felt no holiday cheer  How ever I did like the sweater of Tech Lead ,2,3
would have been interesting if this was a debate between two opposing views  with similar technical knowledge  ,2,2
The market is constantly changing so he changes with the market  He s right about polygon ,4,2
Something tells me you haven t been paying very close attention on this one    ,1,2
By your logic of value on application layer  AWS should be worth very little  for example ,1,2
Polygon is really Promising,1,2
What about Cardano  Could that be a competitor besides Polygon and Avax ,1,4
Crypto boy 2 0,1,2
finally a video trashing ETH   love it,1,2
video sponsored by polygon,1,2
Uh  Polygon is a sidechain that checkpoints with Ethereum   so why so bearish   Edit  Ah  got to the Million token shill  Lmao  I like TechLead but he s pretty bitter about selling that BTC  Don t listen to him regarding crypto ,2,1
Since you re an ex Google tech lead  can you shine some light on Google removing the dislike count from Youtube   It s been weeks now and I still haven t used Youtube  apart from complaining about the dislike being removed  ,2,2
 techlead where did you buy that sweater  so cozy  pls post a link ,1,2
very interesting  i am going to adopt this  walking forth  as an unofficial present from this channel  thank you  happy holidays,2,2
Watch how he just left decentralization out of all this bs lol  Way to paint a very blurry picture for noobs  What a piece of work   or proof of work    Buy ETH  This guy is a walking regret ,1,2
It isn t trash,1,2
And hbar,1,2
Hbar is the future,1,2
Tell that to the thousands of developers building cutting edge apps on the Eth network as we speak,13,3
Lol his whole entire video is ridiculous  ,1,
Shilling SOL  while shitting on ETH    Too bad downvotes are disabled ,1,2
This will age like milk ,2,2
This is just a manipulation   ,1,2
The market cap is so high for Ethereum and so many tokens and utility exist already that it s going to be years before any real change happens  Until then the price will keep going up  Also look at the history of crypto and you will see that BTC and ETH have been the only 2 crypto that have been profitable over the years   BTC and ETH are the bread and butter of crypto  but sure you can eat your salad  When will salad be the new bread and butter   Not any times soon   but the crypto market is getting smarter and smarter so in the future salad might very well be the new bread and butter   Then again  everyone loves their bread and butter  so I see the future being bread and butter and salad and then your top 10 coins ,1,1
I ve been watching you for years   anyone that talks like they know what crypto is or it s values is an absolute fool  Some have utility and some don t   Some have big money behind them   others are the meme that makes no sense   rug pulls as well   You are a fearful guy with too much ego   Trading isn t for you   You think too much and what s worse you think you know better than the markets    The markets expose our character flaws  Specifically our greed  need to be correct and our fear  If those aren t in check you will always be paying to be in the market and take big loses  HODL   not made for the markets  Hold and hope is not a strategy     Some ppl aren t built to be in the market and your ego is tricking you into thinking you belong there   Being a successful Google tech and transitioning to trading didn t give you a leg up  Yea you made money before   but you gave it all back to the market   why   Fear and the need to be correct   Just be a Schill stuff and sell your time   Tough love is needed some times ,36,3
So did he make any good calls in the past 2 years    Just curious  stumbled on this page ,1,
You don t need a blockchain to do a smart contract  blockchains and decentralisation are ineficient by nature  You use it when you really can t trust people in the system and were history has shown that trust is not sufficient to keep the system fair  You can t trust people with money  you can trust a server with a web application ,2,1

Great piece and enjoyed the tech concepts more,2,2
Tech Lead creates some interesting and entertaining videos  but he is probably one of the worst traders on YouTube ,1,2
RSI  Downtrend continues  StochRSI  Approaching oversold  MACD  But maybe a few more dips  VI  Converging but no crossover yet    ETH is still one of the strongest charts though  Bears are in charge short term but this too shall pass ,1,2

Guy is clueless lol,1,2
I agree with your statements on ETH  Also  Thanks for this insight  it s much appreciated  You opened my eyes to something I hadn t thought about   The relationship of the application layer and layer 1 protocols  As well as the potential price point of each layer   Very interesting ,6,2

was this a troll video  in the beginning he criticizes other yt bers for shilling coins and then he goes on to shill million token  lmao i m not sure if this is serious ,1,2
1 18  hodling is actually incredibly difficult work    yeah you re not joking  I bought Million token at  31 and now it s  13 63 so I m just trying to forget I own it at this point ,29,6
Lol million token   The only profit was to buy the release and sell the hype   Rip holders  this guy took your money,2,
 mixjon76 I saw it hit  223 with my own 2 eyes   It happened at 2 00am ish like you mentioned   I was kicking myself for not buying   Now   not so much ,1,

This guy is full of shite I m afraid  to trust a guy who sells Bitcoin at a loss and you expect me to take an opinion of eth  no wonder he s ex Facebook ex Google  ,1,3
what is this  you sold out dude ,2,1
Can someone tell me why is he wrong ,1,1
First layer in Crypto matters   The programming language matters   Only DOT and ETH use Solidity   Solana s Rusk and C is better   For storage of value inflationary rates matter   Utility tokens  prices depend on their popularity  which is not related to real value  like shares   So this analysis is futile   lol,1,2
sell eth buy lion coin er millian tookan,1,2
I thought it was gonna be  10k,2,2
OK WE GET IT YOU ARE AN EX GOOGLE TECH LEAD ,1,2
So glad I found your channel ,2,4
you found it  ur lost,1,
ETH   is a giant  ETH is almost everywhere ETH is the principal ecosystem of smartcontract    GOOD LUCK to take the place of the actual KING  We will see in few year   when he explose,2,2
I like the way you go into things  though  of course  one neeeds a much broader software engineer vocab to grasp its entirety  However  could you please do a piece  or another piece  on NFT s  It seems that they are attached to ethereum and may well be a driver for ethereum ,1,2
Up until mil dollar token shilling  the video actually made sense lol,1,2
What you think of Binance  Has it a future ,1,2
1Million token is better then ETH  Right ex google ex Facebook   ,2,1

nice shilling bro,1,2
iPhones are trash,1,2
 Let s talk about Ethereum   Ethereum is trash    I m loling   thumbs up ,1,2

doesnt matter  you cant stop ETH  why don t you come out with a better coin crypto platform  you wont  thank you,1,2
Comes down to the crypto trilemma  Ethereum can lower gas fees if they so desire   but they do not want to compromise their decentralization unlike other networks such as Solana,18,4
Ethereum can t lower its gas fees  Validators always get the highest paying transactions to be processed first   So because of Ethereum bottleneck  lower fees will not be possible ,1,
 Tyler Jo De Block eth vs etc  Do some research buddy,1,
decentralized as the time they rolled back transactions from the Dao hack in 2016 ,3,
ETH is here to stay  gas fees are high because even with expensive slow transactions  people choose it over other chains  No use  no high gas fees  Check how much ETH was staked for 2 0   thats how many people believe in 2 0  Yes  it s release will likely create a short term down trend in its price  Short term  As the application layer vs  network  layer   chains are not simply a network layer  they are the whole infrastructure layer and you can t own a piece of TCP IP or speculate about it    Trillions of dollars don t depend on it quite in the same way as they would on ETH  So there will be value in the infrastructure layer  Big value  Not only in the app layer  I m no tech lead but I m a software developer too btw  not only a speculator ,4,1
shhhhhh  he obviously is playing dumb because want to acumulate before the merge ,1,
All cryptocurrencies are equally worthless as investments  though one could bet on them  the way people bet on lottery  ,1,4

eth2 0 coming out soon  not saying it would be better  but why wouldn t it because all they could possibly do is copy implementations from either avax or polygon,1,2
Honestly this video serves a powerful ETH buy signal to me  why  because I m not Ex tremely stupid  10K to 20K next year for those who understand what ETH is  Better get your keyboard ready TL  ,21,7
 Cabbage McGraw Well if it does hit even just 10k  a 65  drawdown puts it right back at the same price it is today    soooo NBD ,1,
 Cabbage McGraw true but first BTC and ETH hit new all time highs in 2022 ,1,
Ethereum is projected to go down  65  in the next two years,3,
can we ban this scamer ,1,2
Would you do a video in which you define all the terms you use in this video ,1,3
Thanks man,1,2
didn t get any of that but i ll assume it s because of the nft cringe,1,2
I think this Cyborg s algorithm is broken  all it ever talks about is how they used to work at Google  Whoever operates it needs to update it to the latest trolling version to get the bug fixes ,2,1
 While bitcoin s wild price movements might seem random  they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets  Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance  it s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin   Keeping all this in mind  it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world  Kelvin McCain has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 19 BTC lately He can easily be reached via telegram  kelvinmccain  OR search on google  kelvin mccain cryptos ,33,5

Eth fees are a sign of huge demand  The same way that high real estate prices in Manhattan are a sign of huge demand  Cheap     good,1,0
Im just holding eth till it goes up a bit higher against bitcoin  I bought over 200 eth under  100 in 2017  Hoping to sell it all for around 21 or 22 bitcoin ,7,1
Did I mention that i was a Google tech lead  ,2,2
How about ICP is suitable for Web 3  ,1,2
Also  adding to my last comment about why TL is wrong  ETH is indeed the network layer  and that s a good thing  not a bad thing  because unlike the web 2 0 network layer  TCP IP protocol   using ETH network costs money  Imagine you had a cent for each packet of information delivered in TCP IP  you ll have a trillion dollar a day  ETH is the internet  it s intrinsic value is a portion of the success of all apps built on top of it  You can try to invest in the app itself  but how  And when  And which one  How to pick the winner app  Instead of guessing  simply invest in the platform hosting all apps ,3,1
I m confused    You just sold Ethereum so it can become the 2nd biggest mistake of your life ,310,9
great timing to have sold 2 weeks ago,1,
 skalitstudio you are delusional if he can influence the price of ethereum lmao  That being said he is just creating content for entertainment and we are consuming it ,2,
50  chance,1,
Wtf bro spoilers lmao,4,
 skalitstudio Meet Kevin  Graham Stephan  Andre Jikh  etc ,1,
he s just trying to inspire people to drive the price down so he can buy the dip and make money on the suckers  like so many  influencers  do  whatever ,26,
He is all in on his million token  A few moments later   techlead is buying eth at a discount from the sell off,10,
lol he did,14,
Ethereum is for side chains  L2s is for transactions ,2,2
Dude Ethereum will last as long as there are shitcoins out there that greater fools wanna buy  The gas fees man ,1,0
As much as it breaks my heart  I must agree that ETH is kinda dead right now due to those gas fees   also the scalability is hindered by the low TPS  Moving on from ETH is like breaking with ur gf  always hard  ,7,2
Thanks for these updates,1,0
audio seems off  right ,1,5
Erm  wasn t your coin an erc20 token  developed over the ethereum network  ,1,2
What RL use do you see for crypto otherwise  So far I ve only had an offer for a lifeaboard on Maldives   ,1,2
6 months ago you said u quit crypto,1,3
So dumb  So so dumb ,2,2
Audio out of sync,1,2
Dislike,2,2
I wish I knew if the Tech Lead was actually being sincere or just Trolling everyone  I m sure he s having a good time  but it sucks not knowing what he actually means or think about anything ,139,32
He s looking out for himself  He tells you to sell ETH  the price deflates so he can buy more  He tells you to buy CRO  the price inflates  and he dumps ,1,
its simple  u ignore ambiguous creeps like this ,1,
 Sab S I wish you succeed because you ve assumed what I m making not  It s not my duty to explain how an immutable transaction ledger is superior in applications that require validation,1,
 Watcher if you pay closer attention to his acting you will see how much is blended with trolling sarcasm,1,
 Gaurav Bhardwaj he acts like he s the go to guy  he isn t in the slightest ,2,
 Gaurav Bhardwaj barely  Web3 is the future but his insight is just surface level at best ,2,
Short answer  YES HE S TROLLING  Good grief  who actually thinks they should sell all their Eth   ,5,
 Sab S If you guys cant see it  web 3 is the future  He is giving insights into the tech industry,2,
 Upgrayedd You right about that gas fees are a rip off ,1,
i was thinking the same thing  he starts the video by criticizing other yt bers for shilling tokens and then he shills million token lmao  so i m not sure he s being serious here  very hard to tell when he s joking or serious ,4,
 Sab S guy  he is selling his million token   No more tech talk,4,
Im unsubbing from Tech Lead  he s just shilling crypto these days and not giving any interesting insights to the tech industry,12,
Thanks for commenting Send a direct msg right away What sapp                     ,1,
Hi,1,
What do you think of Elrond,1,2
ETH had it s chance to succeed and flopped so badly with the gas fees etc  ETH 2 0 hasn t eventuated yet  and will likely just cause confusion  but ETH itself is finished ,4,4
What s your opinion on Elrond ,1,0
Thanks for great advice  I just bought more ETH  This man is a great indicator because he is usually wrong in the opposite direction ,2028,113
 James Hawkins Rice Versa,1,
 FOURTYSIX N2    hilarious,1,
And now eth is down lmao,1,
So    How is your ETH doing  How much have you lost during the month ,1,
 ANOMALIA follow one rule  but high and sell low  Jokes aside  if you need help  it s simple  Just stop trading  Hold your positions    ETH will inevitably bounce  but  we ll see how it goes during the 2 0 upgrade  Most of this fear in the market is really just a great buying indicator ,1,
   Eth tanked tho,1,
I hope you re fine mate after this crash    50   ,2,
how are u ,2,
Catchy thumbnail  click bait title  contradicts himself all the time   Next month he ll be like   Why i have HALF of my crypto portfolio in ETH  it will 1002828X ,1,
 Opsec Classified haha  True they butt hurt  But lots of thing tech lead says is true  I mine eth and would sell for other coins  Eth will just be same as Sol  Avax   poly and those other projects might even surpass,1,
 Simon Waddington ask again in 6 months when ETH is over double current value ,3,
Wrong in the opposite   so he s always right  ,1,
Yesssss lmao  his story is  the biggest mistake of my life is selling 500million dollars of btc for 2500     also  sell eth,2,
He called AVAX and FTM 2 months ago,1,
He sold bit coins  Enough said ,1,
How are ya holding up ,1,
Lol   how does it feel to be 20 25  down since you bought more ,1,
Prices are all time low buddy  He was serious,1,
The only thing I don t like about Etherium is the outrageous gas fee  I literally paid  175 Etherium to transfer over  800 gala coins from CRO  Ridiculous ,4,
Facts are stubborn ,1,
He is correct and a big sell off of Ethereum is coming ,6,
 Veggie patch lol,2,
How much did you loose in 2 weeks ,3,
how do you feel after paying alot of money on a  Demo  Coin   i hope Ether 2 0 gonna be useful when they Release it after 6 years  ,1,
Haha well right now he s looking smart sadly    ,1,
Some y all saying he crazy but what u don t know eth cost way to much the    fees and slow as hell the transactions     Yes he sold his bit coin to fast but it s still a win   because he made  ,4,
 Formidable Do you understand what he is saying  Are you blind  Ethereum is lower level that some higher level thing like Binance Smart Chain  Only a fool would directly use Ethereum when you have much cheaper  much faster options  Ethereum consumes too much power  In the future  Ethereum use case would become the same as bitcoin  Bitcoin would beat Ethereum ,3,
 warwicklichso shortsighted views mean nothing,1,
Lol how s your Ethereum gamble doing ,3,
Unfortunately for you  he was right this time  ETH is scraping 3K bottom now  Ouchhhhh ,7,
Congrats on  50 ,6,
so jokes those that know  know ,1,
 Rezaile Time no idea,1,
I have a few ETH to  just cos i expect it might go up  but he is right  it is useless  There are projects out there that are far beyond ETH ,8,
 Formidable and who made you king know it all  Either argue with a valid point  or stop talking  No need to throw insults just because he says something you don t like,2,
 Barack Osama     Brah  so Funny        I m sure every country has better spies than him  Maybe he works for Starbucks,1,

He is correct about Ethereum but incorrect about multi chain being viable  That being said  ETH will still continue to appreciate just not as fast as some others ,1,
Yep buying more ETH now  he started the video buy showing you how he screwed up by selling bitcoin           so why the hell do I want to listen to him because he got fired from google   ,10,
 ANOMALIA         jus hold my friend  Don t let the bear scare u   no matter what it s doing today  we all kno etherium is going up eventually  Jus hold ,6,
Agree long eth,1,
I too  bought more ETH  I had it when it was  20 and sold  Rebought at  4k  I need help ,7,
Thanks  I just sold bc you just bought,3,
True  he makes most of his money on You Tube,3,
Commonly known as a  reverse indicator ,7,
 Formidable agreed   Not selling my ETH ever,3,
HAHAHA yoooi was thinking the same thing  Sentiment things  Scary how this guy has so many loyal followers,3,
LMAO RIGHT,1,
It s funny to watch all you ETH fans get butt hurt about someone dissing ETH        ,30,
Who knows  Diverse portfolio is required  all new tech  hence Sol down 4 times with no one even batting a eyelid and not effecting costs,1,
 Rezaile Time I was wondering too ,2,
Yep I bought more too,5,
Eth has its issues  No denying that  Also purely from a   gains perspective  people can make more money by riding L1s and even L2s ,8,
How is it that this guys has so many subscribers ,16,
 The crypto market has been favourable in the past weeks  I keep missing out on this opportunity  I m most certainly very impatient how can I ever make a profit in the crypto market  ,10,14

As an engineer I agree tbh  the most value will be at the application layer Similar to how most of the value in today s most advanced societies comes from Services not Industries  the knowledge to build a car is more expensive than the metal to build it ,57,15
As a self taught engineer  I disagree with this statement  Atleast in terms of the value of eth  eth will always be have value since its a requirement to interact with the blockchain  there is no way around  so even if eth wont be used as a store of value  it will be the gateway to use the applications built on top ,2,
 Life s A Beach what i understand is the network model of eth is peer to peer  Which usually we are using client server model  In which case  all will still be built on top of internet protocol  Please educate me   I would think cryptography exists even for data in transit instances between nodes  Currently nobody can break aes128 as of yet unless with a quantum computer  If that happens all will be in the gutters  Eth uses udp for discovery ,1,
 jeremy cheong blockchain technology is way more robust   fast  and secure than tcpip and udp therefore   it s being used in financial transactions   Think of it as the next generation of today s internet   So  you invest in ethereum hoping it will  replace the current internet protocol   Million token he is selling has no practical use like dog coins,3,
 Winged Hussar yea what I m trying to understand is what do we need a second road for  We have the internet and our isps pretty much did the job for us    edit  just found out crypto is layer 8 above all that we know of  It s already application layer  TCP or UDP 30303  Osi 7 layers still apply  We shouldnt pay for the nodes if there s no reason to  Things like crypto games shouldn t exist  a simple Id to identify an item or object would suffice ,2,
What are the applications that would need to be built over these other networks instead of just over the usual internet  Why incur any fees at all if there s no need for the validation  Unless we are are able to share computing power otherwise what s the point  I m new to crypto  but so far what I m seeing are nfts  used to launder money probably  and crypto games   Trying their best to mimic second life   Also  if most of the applications can be cloud hosted  we already solved the infrastructure portion  I see crypto as an upgrade to the current swift network ,1,
 Budget King I m a fulltime web developer with computer science background  ,2,

Mate  you may be wrong   to build a car in Europe could be very expensive it the Russia does not sell their gas cheap  and it won t    This is what actually is happening   ECB printed euros during Covid  but Russia increased its price on natural gas markedly it sells to Europe  retaliation some would say    How come Russian people live worse that people in Switzerland   because Russia sells its resources way too cheap to the world ,1,
Are all smart contract tokens then all going to be poor performers in the long haul since they will be commodities pushing the price down against each other ,2,1

Tech Lead  the biggest mistake in my life is selling Bitcoin too early  My advice to you now is  sell all your Ethereum,1190,45

That had me laughing  My investment strategy  invest in these other blockchains until Eth gets it s act together and lowers gas fees  Then plow back into Eth ,1,

Now is the time to buy,2,0
As a dapp builder I find it extremely weird that everybody is saying eth is the future  It is simply unusable  To mint an nft I had to pay over  300  And if you think eth 2 0 will fix all this you are in for a huge surprise  Yes the fees will be lower and the netword will be faster but nowehere near enough  The best they can get is a 64x increase  But they have to shard the chain for that and that brings a lot of security concerns  Also they will want everybody to run a node on their personal devices which is great and all until you realise that you will need at least 500gb of storage and  nasa  internet  The blockchain will dies sooner or later ,7,3

Jesus man  it s like you re completely oblivious to not only Polygon  but your own damn Million Token being  on Ethereum   now you re just shilling products too ,1,2
Most layer 2 chains in the future will have no gas fees ,1,0
Did you research Pulse Chain  Coming very soon  World s the largest airdrop to help Eth gas fees ,1,0
what about decentralization  It s not worthy anymore  Ethereum can be slow expensive and and have inferior tech but it s one of the most decentralized smartcontract currencies if not the 1st one  and it s not trash  we are not here for tps  or for having a single entity controlling the network  we are here for freedom  I m not defending eth specifically I know it s flaws  and having vitalik as it s  guide    but rather confronting the idea that all that matters is tps  this idea is wrong and can make many people that are not millionaires lose a lot of money in the future  like it did in the past,2,3
Who tf cares for decentralization when u have to pay 150  of fees for one transaction ,1,

Ethereum is the only crypto that s vaguely popular and has a chance of not using insane amounts of electricity to mine once 2 0 launches  Trading crypto is a losing game,1,0
You missed an important part of the tradeoff between tx s and security  Yeah  chains can have very high throughput  but that s at the cost of security  If security is not a concern  why even use blockchain  Why not just use old fashioned databases which have so much more throughput than the Polygon example you used ,8,5
Because they are still decentralized to a greater extent   Security will always be a challenge   nothing will be perfect because the tradeoffs exist  Believing in the purity of bitcoin has some noble qualities I suppose   but real practical adoption of the best parts of crypto will have to compromise in order for mass adoption to occur ,1,
Well  I think the benefit of Ethereum is that you ve built Million Token on it   ,3,0
nice sweater  ,1,0
Thanks for the eth buy signal,4,0
No mention of XRP as usual   ,2,0
Getting ready for Pulsechain launch eh ,1,0
