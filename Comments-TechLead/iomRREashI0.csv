Sorry but your analysis is very vague bases on guess if  You didn t convinced me  Bitcoin won t go zero my friend but you got a view and a comment on your YouTube channel ,1,
At some point the FUD becomes reality and reality drains your life savings  Lets be smart about all this  China has basically banned all Crypto  Let that sink in  Other countries might follow  The US is hinting some form of regulations  At the end of the day  BTC is still exchanged for Fiat and without the ability to easily exchange BTC for Fiat it kills the entire Crypto experiment  I m not saying people should sell but people should be well aware of the dangers lurking on the horizon ,2,

Great video and some nice tips This is a scary time for new investor but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions  This could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount  Wealth is created during bear markets  not bull markets  If your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk  Let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon  I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 16  btc from day trading with ALEX VALENTINE in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearishy,109,16

Suggesting that stable coins is an ideal store of wealth is ridiculous  Stable coins  like dollars  lose value every year to inflation  This is literally the reason to use a store of value   Suggesting that the primary use case of Bitcoin is as a global currency is in direct conflict with what it is actually used for  A store of value    Also suggesting that the FBI can t track down crypto transfers is demonstrably wrong  It is MUCH more trackable than cash    Also stable coins like Tether and USDC can be used for ransom attacks just as easily as other cryptos currencies  The actual transfers of the currency on a blockchain are anonymous and decentralized  It is primarily the backing and audit policies that are centralized ,1,0
National digital currencies are a horror   They allow the government to seize your money for any reason  and control how much you spend and what you spend it on   It is pure slavery ,1,0

For crypto to fail the majority of the planet has to believe its no longer profitable  No one person can do that by himself and crypto is still relatively new and only a small   of the population is invested in to begin with  Its potential is to high to fail  At least for the next 120 years until bitcoin has been mined 100 ,1,0

  Nice video I m new to cryptocurrency and I don t understand how it really works  Can someone guide me on the right approach to investing and making good profit from cryptocurrency investment  ,4,4
  I totally agree with what you are saying   I started in crypto in August 2017  and I bought in   I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85  during the ensuing 4 year bear market   I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do   I wish I had bought more   I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Richard I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor Richard Golod who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past   It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research      I left his contacts in the comment below take care ,30,6

If Bitcoin  went to zero  at least a FEW people in the world would want the entire supply  if for no other reason than historical purposes or perhaps a nostalgic resurgence of interest in it   Doge coin anyone    Thus  there would be a market and technically  would never be worth zero,9,2

Great video  I agree that it is likely that bitcoin will not be the one universal currency used by all nations  It s a wonderful idea with great fundamentals  to a libertarian like me  but as you said  absolute financial data and surveillance is far too valuable and powerful for governments to pass up  Changing their fiat into blockchained fiat means that they will be able to control it as they already do  but also track every transaction  which is priceless information  and way too much information at that  I m stocking my bunker and getting my  tinfoil hat out for the day that happens and everyone swallows it  BUT  bitcoin doesn t even need to become the global reserve currency  or the one worldwide universal currency  It will still have the 5 traits of money  making it a good store of value and a viable asset that will always have a demand in a world of continually devaluing fiat currencies  because of governments and banks that create fiat out of thin air via debt  and manipulate and control it  Bitcoin is not going to die because of this  the same reason as gold will always have value  aside from the industrial and jewelry uses of gold ,5,1

You re missing the fact that Decentralized Bitcoin is limited property  cbdc is not  It s not going to zero ,1,0
so here  7 months ago  you say bitcoin is going to zero and digital regulated governmental currency will replace as china did    but yet you continue all your videos talking about the cryptos to buy and sell  a bit hypocritical   wouldn t you say ,1,3
So to sum it all up you saying we should trust the government and support CBDC s with the only prime argument on decentralisation and privacy being bad for the government    So the government is here to protect us common citizens and do not favor those who are not common  Cool yes BTC is going to 0 yal     SMH ,1,0

The way I see it s   Government and institutional power  will fight against anything that is taking away from them   Government administration  and other power figures  you put names here    Won t give up easy    The issue is not that crypto is bad or not  It s the power taken away from banks and government is the issue    Suppose government can t print more money   Well who are they going to steal from   to pay what they owed   or to buy what they want  We go to work invest try to do something to get extra money    Flash news          Government produce nothing   But use a lot    So  I love the project I hope one day works but    Maybe a hard Battle to take away money control from them   They will lie  jailed you even kill you for money  ,1,0

I also feel bitcoin w ll start to decline  Only china has banned bitcoin but so its safe atm but when more countries start to do the same to protect itself from cyber attacks  then eventually there will be no use for it  Alot of people say it will be a store of value like gold but gold is accepted worldwide and since bitcoin will not then its gonna fail in that aspect as well ,1,0
Then how is million token useful ,2,0
i only got into Bitcoin like 10 months ago but i think it ll always be valuable in the blockchain era  people will trade their different  casino chips and have tons of different protocols and stable coins but those 21 million bitcoin will have value  it stores value well  and is good hedge against everything ,1,0

HAHAHAHA    Is this video a joke    The biggest threat to the absolute best  most secure  most decentralized  most incorruptible form of money ever created is the worst form of money ever created  Where they can do whatever the hell they want with your money   If countries were going to ban bitcoin then they would have banned it already  It s already way too late because crypto has become too popular and created so many businesses and jobs  And they want to collect billions in tax revenue from it  Why else would they be letting it get more and more popular  Why are they waiting to ban it  The longer they wait the harder it will be  And if they try to ban it in America it will go all the way to the supreme court where the constitution will secure our right to own bitcoin   The lightning network makes bitcoin transactions practically free and instant ,1,0

Pretty horrible  especially the part about total government control  Now I really want Bitcoin ,1,0
the US monetary system was printing money causing inflation  When the US decides to have  its own stable coin it will be no different  They will keep on creating a unlimited amount of stable coins as they cover national debt causing more and more inflation   The main reason the cryptocurrency revolution started was to combat against inflation and protect a individuals from spending privacy  In addition it was to protect individuals financially as they can still have the ability to have access to their finances no matter what economic crisis we are in  If you recall in 2008 financial crisis   nearly all banks were about to close their doors because people were withdrawing their money like crazy  Had the feds had their way  many people would Severely suffer  So yes it is obvious that initial cryptocurrencies was created for this basis point  Therefore I don t see bitcoin or other decentralized cryptocurrency s ever going to zero  There will always be a cryptocurrency to protect the people for those basis points I mentioned above  In addition  corporations and the rich surely would not prefer to keep  their money in the central bank system whereas the inflation will make the money worth less over time   Though  I will say you ve made some compelling arguments ,1,0
Man I m a believer in BTC  ETH and some other coins and tokens with good projects  but you information is very rich  Good work  And to all people who bash this guy  you should stop trading  u know nothing about trading if you want to bash someone who s opinion is against you  listen to them  get their point of view  combine it with urs  and use it in ur advantage  if you can t do that  quit trading in any form  crypto  stocks   ,2,1

The fatal flaw is power consumption and the jacking up of costs of GPUs creating a double negative  Current Digital currencies like Bitcoin  etc  are also increasingly more centralized using forking and dedicated Mining Farm server centers  This puts the whole thing in a limited control rather than decentralized status  Plus the power consumption   increased levels of pollution with most countries still dependent on fossil and other fuels that destroy rather than preserve ecologically sensitive locations on this planet  These factors will cause the hype and bubble to burst and the only ones trying to still push it are the millionaires and billionaires that are using these as a money grab compelling the global masses to  get in now  so they can grab more funds and then pull out just before the meltdown and use the excuse  its a high risk  game and you simply didn t know the game   Those of us who been around for the whole development of technologies from way back in the days of  arcade cabinets and consuls playing Pong seem to be the only ones aware of these issues and how things really go  This stuff is going to be a dead end soon  Its best to just stay away from them all together ,1,0

This point of view is simplistic   1  Bitcoin is a Store of Value  not a currency   2  USD paper has been used for more crime than can be counted  and that will continue   3  a stable coin of any kind will be endlessly  printed  just like the USD fiat making it worthless  and  4  Facebook can t data gather Crypto  well too bad for Facebook  in time Facebook will go the way of MySpace  no one under 26 even uses Facebook    F    Facebook   but Bitcoin will last forever  Rock on ,1,0
I hold BTC and I m not impressed with it  It s a beta run  not the final stop  So many people don t have a long term vision on this topic  This video is excellent  When governments regulate all exits to cash out BTC to anything else  you will see it die  Meaning all exit ramps  exchanges  etc taxed into oblivion that s it for BTC  The future of crypto is CBDCs  payments  gaming and NFTs  BTC ain t it chief ,1,0
The only way Bitcoin will go down hard is when governments have a reliable and transparentt monetary policy  Which is only possible with a government that is small that only does core government duties like protecting free speech and property rights   I don t think that will ever happen without Bitcoin  So most likely Bitcoin will become the standard and then governments will have no choice but to comply and return to its core business   I think the separation of money and state is inevitable ,2,0
You seem far off on this ,1,0
A lot of what he said was true but Bitcoin will never go to  0  CBDCs and alt coins with real world utility like xrp will take over the financial system  however Bitcoin will always be used as a store of value like gold  Just because people won t be transacting with it in their everyday lives doesn t mean it won t be used at all ,34,9
Bitcoins is worth only as much as what group of people agrees on   so it does not stores the value   it reflects some agreement  It can not be compared to gold or other physica unique securities which stores the  real  value due to their utility   gold has utility value and speculative value  Bitcoin has no utility value only speculative value  It is just an agreement and agreements between people change ,5,
Its market price and it s value are linked but not necessarily the same  You will likely always find someone willing to exchange for bitcoin at some price greater than  0  Doesn t make it a good investment ,3,

One problem with your thesis   The US is a democracy and so laws are passed by voted lawmakers   China can do whatever China does because it is NOT a democracy   Case in point  you don t have to wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle in California because voting motorcycle riders would be damned if you take away their right to be as dangerous as they want   Think about it  the US can t even ban GUNS   You think they can ban Crypto currency ,1,0
CDBC are NOT money  There are not a store of value when the bank and the government hold the private keys  Who would want to accept digital yuan when the Chinese government can just take all your money  Even in China adoption is low  and it is only adopted because the government is forcing people  Worse this money is programmable so it could be set up to ration  your  own money to you  This is similar to the scams run in the 19th Century where mine owners forced miners to work for tokens called chits ,1,0
I think you mistake BTC for what it is  it s actually not intended to replace or to be used to pay for goods and services  BTC intention is store of value  Now wheather you agree or not is your own opinion  but BTC its self is not intended for that  If they ban crypto then that means their going to bankrupt regular exchanges as well  Also Robinhood could loose revenue as well as they hold crypto projects already on their exchange ,1,0
You forgot to mention why Bitcoin exists  Fiat money will end in disaster  You can kick the can Down the road but when it explodes it will be worse   Final settlement  is the only way out to create a future  There will be resistance  but in the end truth will manifest ,1,0
The greatest irony of Bitcoin is that in its attempt to create a currency outside of government control  it opened the door to currency that maximizes government control ,11,2
What your saying is really smart  So here s the only way it works  Everyone comes together and erases all debt in the world instantly  Countries don t owe anything to each other  all wiped away  a restart  CBDC based on last year GDP  CBDC per country supply has a ratio to gdp that either inflates or is burned annually    This is never going to happen  NEVER    So I hear  A new digital version of the broken system  Sure  Bitcoin is the first rule based monetary system ever created but it s not a currency of the world and if it ever is that means the world has ended as you know it  Btc is a store of value when value as you know it is gone and it s going  Let s see how this plays out when the fiat s start crashing ,1,0
Bitcoin doubled in value since he made this video  Sometimes what the governments of this world want isn t what its people go along with  Most people of this planet aren t governed like the people living in the most populated country  China ,3,0
That s what I said  How can bitcoin ever replace fiat money when it can rise 50 times in a few months and crash in another  This is just the gimmick of the compunerds   A revolution if you like   For them to create an asset out of code and make money out of thin air   And  decentralization  is just a flimsy sales talk by these compunerds aimed at suckering in  Gen Y and Millenial lower class retail investors who have been blocked out of every other traditional asset class  Yet who are the ones who benefit the most  The creators of every coin  And the ones who jumped on the bandwagon early  But damn why did I not join the party earlier  Is the party really over already   So BTCUSD will not rise to  100k as predicted ,1,0
Every Bitcoin can be tracked throughout its entire life and every transaction is known to all  Bitcoin is not in any way anonymous  it is actually more like the Orwellian CBDCs you were talking about ,1,0

My take  fiat turns into CBDC and no longer exists  CBDC integrates with blockchains  Eventually something new joins the duo or one wins over the other  The transition away from physical fiat could be the elimination of coins as a start  People will lose money when using cash so they d prefer the other digital alternatives ,1,1

The idea that any industrilized country would allow a decentralized digital currency to dominate their financial system just doesn t make sense  Stable coins issued by each country are a given but I feel  BTC is a decentralized store of value like no other  It sounds far fetched but I could see BTC as the world reserve currency controlled by no country and used as a medium of exchange by which each country measures the value of their digital currency on the world market  The world is becoming ever more connected and if each country is to remain with and independent currency we need a decentralized basis upon which to measure these digital currencies ,1,1

Opinions like yours are very much appreciated  However  we are in extreme different times with many other key factors in play that werent in previous markets      They  now own the market     yes  read the charts  however  ZOOM OUT and think of the WHY s  regarding the action of the last weeks and going forward  Everything has changed and will change fast in these months ahead  Cant be ignored if advising I will say we all should prepare for any scenario as the market has always been volatile I have played safe by putting my assets into active trades so I don t feel the price if the declination continues I have made over 16 btc since early november till date from implementing trades with insights and infos from Jamie wangs I will advise everyone to stick to this method instead of just waiting on a pump,25,11

You make a lot of great points and I think you are right about what the government wants to do   However  I think you place far too much trust in the government   We were scammed out of 8000 dollars by fraudsters through the US banking system  The banks don t care about the little guy  Nothing was reversed  I would rather not have them selling my financial information  It all depends on the resolve of the people    again to your point  people are extremely weak these days ,1,0

government issued currency is built to fund wars  So that citizens kill other citizens across the planet they would have otherwise been friends with  And since you need that currency to feed your family  you have to go to war    what happens when you no longer need a government issued currency  well then you no longer need war  Instead you can trade your service for universal decentralized currency  That can not be tampered with by government    And for that  you shall now be labeled as a terrorist by tyrannical governments and prosecuted to the full extent of the law    the road to serfdom  ,1,0

Your video lacks any real insight  is full of misinformation and im pretty sure you dont know s    about bitcoin   1  Bitcoin is not a currency and shouldnt be perceived as such  2  Governments print money  inflation happens  fiat money loses value  Fiat currencies are not a store of wealth as you said in your video  i mean that is just a stupid thing to say  On the other hand  Bitcoin in a store of value where the value is in the limited number of bitcoins that will ever be in circulation  21MM Bitcoins  Bitcoin is a commodity and should be considered as an asset that appreciates in value  3  The security that the technology provides  proof of work   enables the highest levels of security  which increases trust in storage of value and wealth as an asset  4  The technology behind bitcoin is a Fair and Just technological solution for societies  A simple example would be political elections   the way the technology works means that political elections cannot be manipulated or rigged with the highest levels of confidence  5  A key reason governments are creating their own digital currencies is fear of their citizens holding digital USD oppose to their domestic currency so their citizens have an opportunity to maintain value in their personal wealth  Just look at countries like lebanon  greece  venezuela etc  the government basically stole citizens money  Digital stable coins are an answer for people in corrupt countries where value in local currency see substantial loss    Im neither saying to invest in bitcoin or that it doesnt have its upcoming challenges  but theres a lot more positive reasons to believe in it  which you completely overlooked   And btw  China did not ban cryptocurrency  as you said in your video  China banned exchanges and made trading activities illegal   p s  this is the last video i watch of yours cos you talk B S ,1,0

the problem is that most countries that have their own currency have a currency that is growing weaker against the dollar  this forces those countries to do two things  tax or print more  since it is easier to print than tax its own citizens  printing more  or in the case of a CBDC  minting is likely what they will do   will not fix the inflation problem  i dont see this as being any different from the current system  this is why bitcoin is so important dont you think ,12,1

 stable coins where they just print them out of thin air     You mean   Like the US dollar     lol  The USD is the biggest junk coin in the world  and when it crashes people will be looking for a store of value somewhere else  and crypto will be a part of that pie ,1,0
Spot on commentary   bitcoin being sold as a decentralized currency will ultimately be its undoing  you can t necessarily  ban  it  but you can make it impossibly hard to use  In the end  we are all creatures of convenience and no one will want to go through the bitcoin hassle   the sheep will follow a central bank digital currency while others will stick to the bitcoin  or other blockchain  and the like  Sadly there are more sheep ,6,2
I love watching these  predictions  at exactly the right amount of time later   I E Bitcoin will plumet in 3 days  I come back 3 days later to see it skyrocketing again     6 months later after your video Bitcoin Skyrocketing again    The only place I see Bitcoin going is to MAX Market cap  once that happens the dollar will be almost obsolete and we will be in a new erra of currency  That s my  prediction  for the next 50 years  I ll be 80  and still poor but rich in comparison to some who didn t invest,1,0
There could be a high incentive in the future for countries especially capitalist ones to attach their currencies to something like bitcoin  So  in my mind bitcoin would  as it does now  act as a store of wealth  I do not see this changing  But this is an interesting point you bring up with countries seemingly wanting more data control rather than trading it for something of sustainable  stable growth ,8,1

Ya buddy  I think you hit the nail on the head  the world bankers are not going to idly stand by and let decentralized currency wipe them out  they want to stay in control  and what better way than to make your own centralized Fed Coin  giving them total transparency of every transaction  No one is talking about these corporations  banks  and other countries behind the scenes developing digital gold currencies that can be broken down into the smallest increments  Personally  I think digital Gold and Silver will be the new form of currency in the future because the digital assets will have to be backed by hard currency for lack of manipulation  Better stack that God money  it s been here for thousands of years  and it will be here when we re gone  Hence the term  God s money  Great content  keep up the good work ,1,0

Oh man  My friend I think you are vastly misunderstanding a few things here  Stable coins function as actual currencies whereas Bitcoin is actually an ASSET  An asset is something you invest in  usually long term  that ideally increases in value over time  exactly like a Stock  Stable coins are currencies similar to FIAT currencies such as the USD  GBP and Euro that are simply a STABLE store of value  The clue is in the name  We simply use it to make transactions and we dont expect it to grow massively in value  although that would be nice  but we dont  Basically Bitcoin and Stable coins are two very different types of cryptocurrency that are not really meant to be compared  However  I do agree that Central Bank Digital currencies could have many advantages  with scalability and even prevent inflation but only if they are created with a fixed max amount of tokens  ,1,0

         Thanks for the educative video         I still see cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investment  and i totally love the technology when it comes to the largest crypto  asset Bitcoin  even though the asset has been exhibiting some bearish  performance of lately  The good thing is that bitcoin bulls has been  able to successfully defended the  40 000 support level strongly which  is a clear thoughts that the short term correction is seeings it s end  soon and willing to trigger a strong uprise towards  50 000 resistance  region  However bitcoin trading has been a success story for me ever  since i trading  with chen strategy and signals   You can also  become a winner today  We should follow the way of earning more  regardless of the current market  bulls or bears   which is trading  Buy  the dip and trade   i have made over 6 8 btc profits not just buying  the dip but implementing trades with him  You can easily get to Mr  Carlos is reachable on here   W h a t s A P P        4  4  7   8  2  8  4  5  0  7  6  8         e    e  g r a m     chentradingi ,1,0

Oh you mean 0 for you because you sold it all  K gotcha   ,1,1
you re saying bitcoin will fail because of countries trying to control or outmaneuver it  the reason this won t stifle bitcoin s adoption by the masses it because IT IS DECENTRALIZED  one of the main reasons why it s used is because no one governs it  it governs itself  what would be the purpose of creating a japanese e coin if there is no different from the yen    moreover  there are some aspects i believe you missed  1  bitcoin s first layer cannot be changed  that s why innovations and adapations will be applied on the second layer  creating a improvements through consensus 2  the fees and the costs will be lowered through add ons to the second layer  lightning network and taproot will both be adopted during 2021 and will revolutionize bitcoin  hell  lightning network is already useable  download blue wallet   3  the anonymity that bitcoin provides cannot be matched by any governed or centralized coin    bitcoin is not only a currency  it s a revolution ,2,0

Central Bank digital currencies aren t crypto so how are they a threat  They are just digital fiat essentially  Bitcoin can be tracked anyway  Privacy coins are the future,2,1
 Bitcoin is anonymous no one knows what s going on   Wow you clearly have no knowledge of how bitcoin works     bitcoin is the most transparent data on the planet      And it always amazes me how some people don t see the difference between an authoritarian spy like and censorship currency compared to the freedom economicly liberting decentralised currency like bitcoin    We have seen so many examples of governments failing at stopping bitcoin    if bitcoin could be stopped it would have happened by now  Instead it s getting stronger and stronger with more powerful groups backing it as bitcoin protect then against the inflation caused by fiat currency which is easily manipulated  If we could actually trust our politicians to not inflate away our purchasing power than we wouldn t need bitcoin,1,0
Fiat currencies go to zero as goverment keep printing  Bitcoin has a fixed supply and it s value in fiat currency will keep rising as has been the case since it s innception ,1,0

this guy looks stressed because his shorts have been going to zero,3,2
I disagree with your initial statement that Bitcoin could go to zero  Stable coins have there place  but not as store of value  What makes Bitcoin attractive  is the fact that it is not pegged to inflationary fiat currency like the USD ,2,1
Lots to think about    Thanks,1,1
If the people in turkey would have bought bitcoin before there currency crashed they would have been thankful for its existence   Who knows what the future tells  all I know is that it s currently the fukin solution to a problem we are facing,1,2

If stable coins are 1 to 1 with the dollar at any point in time  then the stable coin is devalued at the same pace as the dollar  Whats the point in that  And how is that a store of wealth  Its not even a store of value  bitcoin sidesteps the money changers  are stable coins safe from the money changers  If not then what is point of that  The only thing you missed is that real people really need a new  better and safer way to live day to day life  especially in unbanked countries and everyone wants to earn value for thier time spent trading time for a paycheck at work  The dollar doesn t provide that anymore  People will fight  push back over too many restrictions or bans  Especially if crypto affords them a better lifestyle  that cant be taken away from people and expect them not to say something ,1,1

I have been looking at bitcoin for months and have always though it will not survive without banks this is its only flaw  If banks ban it  will become worthless  I am not tech head but just  do look at problems with a rounded view  Thank you  you have confirmed to me that bitcoin will be a waist of time in the long run  but i have to say money can be made for awhile in crypto,1,1

Bitcoin can t be stopped  It will always have some value due to its limited supply ,3,1
Yes you missed one thing    Bitcoin is not a currency  Bitcoin is an asset that competes well with gold  real estate or other asset class,19,13
 Latvijas Runa ok is it worth  12 000 or not    Your point that you buy and never sell has been disproved by the recent price action  If you sold at  60k you could buy back 2X what you sold today    If intrinsic value is  12k like you said the  Why not sit on cash and wait for a sell off   If You are suggesting the intangibles are worth infinite  which is a ridiculous notion  why not mortgage the house ,1,
 Latvijas Runa how is it a store of wealth when it just cut value in half in a few weeks  That would seem to me to be the opposite of store of wealth ,1,
 Latvijas Runa exactly  You said it competes well with other asset classes like gold and real estate  As examples   I derive value fair value of gold on marginal production cost and real estate on relative or historical cap rate  I have yet to figure out how to do same for Bitcoin  What do you use  ,1,
Interesting comment   please explain how bitcoin comepetes with real estate  How do you create a fair value calculation of bitcoin ,1,
 sharplikecheddar2 ok  do what you want to do  but Bitcoin don t need permission,1,
 sharplikecheddar2 Bitcoin is up 50  yearly  you don t look at it short term  No one can stand against or manipulate Bitcoin  Property can be confiscated and gold can be confiscated  Your property is yours as long as your government sez so  Bit coin is ultimate invention for wealth storage  I like to invest in certain types of properties I got nothing against it but safest place to store my wealth is Bitcoin  I don t trade Bitcoin I store my wealth there ,2,
 sharplikecheddar2 jajajajaja  Save this comment please  so you can see in a few years the short term vision of your comment  Bitcoin is bank killer baby,3,
My cash flowing real estate always generates me income  even if the housing market pulls back I make money  Bitcoin has lost 70  of its value in the last few months and is heavily manipulated   Do not confused gold and real estate  both which have actual physical uses and demand with a subject storage of wealth    Crypto is here to stay but not until the central banks get in front of it  Before then your gambling and riding waves ,3,
I can t believe how many people  including the smart and successful ones  do not know what cryptocurrency is supposed to do and why it was created to begin with  or maybe they simply don t want to discuss that   I won t write too much here and not the type to make comments a lot but I will say this as a very experienced  crypto guy  from 2013   Btw I literally spend all my money I had saved over many years within 1hr of discovering bitcoin  which is a significant amount even today   The cryptocurrency was created to create freedom  independence  security safety and privacy from the governments and powerful companies and entities who seek control over the PEOPLE  I said governments  not government  Yes  all of the governments or such entities who seek to control and monitor people     That was the only goal of cryptocurrency when it was created before any exchanges listed any cryptocurrency  We did not use  and still don t for the most part  lousy exchanges to buy cryptocurrency  Going thru any exchanges defeats the purpose of crypto   They will report it to the governments and to certain powerful people entities  So  this is the response to this video and any video that treats crypto just as a product  It s not so much about the  product   It s more of a revolutionary tool to gain independence etc from the things mentioned above    The real people who understand crypto  not a lot of them though unfortunately   are willing to defend it by ANY MEANS NECESSARY     Any means necessary includes any and all methods no matter what s at stake     Will crypto go to zero and stay at zero  The answer is no or at least hopefully not  The sad part is  cryptocurrency is no longer decentralized and anonymous and any anonymity left  is about to get lost  Please don t respond and say it is decentralized  It s not decentralized if they know where the locations of minings are  Okay  And its not anonymous if they know who owns it and how much   Can you still make money with crypto  Probably so  However  the goal of crypto was never for you to make money  not the primary goal at least   It was for you to literally spend  1 or  50 million without literally anyone  including your bank   banks are right there with governments and powerful entities  knowing where this money went    I don t think this will be the case anymore  These entities loss the battle to completely destroy cryptocurrency  Now  they got smart and decided to own and control it and basically turn it into any other product they can monitor  Sure you get an encrypted code when you buy crypto but what purpose does it serve when they know what this code means  who owns it  how much they paid etc etc    I m not a social media guy and am not here to debate with anyone  What I said is non debatable so go ahead respond but the chances are I will not respond to your response  I m simply teaching whoever reads this some knowledge  If you are very very very interested in learning  you can contact me directly and I will teach you some stuff for free ,1,0
I agree  Im a crypto OG and have had these thoughts exactly  Transaction times are way too slow to be a global currency  Nobody will want to accept Bitcoin when it will take 2 weeks to a month to receive it  Also  we already have digital currencies  I click the buy button with my USD on a daily basis  And there will always be a paper to back it  An asset can never truly be an asset without a physical being  Currencies will remain the same but the way they are distributed via Swift will more than likely change in the future ,1,0
this why Ravencoin is the next big thing because it is designed with legal requirements in mind  RVN is Bitcoin 3 0 and came from best Bitcoin developers  ravencoin inherits Bitcoin features   assets and complete ecosystem  RVN is rising and it is on 43 exchanges world wide and recently joined SEPA and OpenDAO ,1,0
I d imagine the implementation of centralized cryptocurrency could also be good for bitcoin   the central banking system has always been less than perfect  but as far as the ransom goes   it could be the driving force   I don t know if that is a complete game changer  especially if the rising popularity for decentralized currency increases ,14,2
 I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like mr Chen lawrence  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 9 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy  You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM    chentrading1,2,0
I made about   60 millions with Bitcoin in the past 9 years and I sold most of my Bitcoin around April this year  2021    I have known the issues with cryptocurrency since day one  The 2 main problems are  first of all  energy consumption  which  for reasons that I won t explain here  cannot be solved by advancing mining technology  secondly  it s value can be easily manipulated  Joe Biden s stimulus check increased the value of crypto  while the end of COVID 19 pandemic will cause the crash of crypto and I won t even bother mentioning Elon Musk ,1,0

I feel like this video didn t address the fundamental principle behind the creation of bitcoin  the desire for a decentralised ability to store  transfer and spend a digital  currency  without government or banks dictating rules to its users   There are millions of people who truly hate the idea that they are financially beholden to bureaucrats  Also  institutional investors have ploughed billions of dollars into bitcoin  and these guys don t usually flip flop over shorter timescales with their investments ,3,1

Centralized  Stable  coins pegged to the banking cult s monetized debt are the enemy of  humanity   This is a none issue   You know what s funny about Tether tho  Tether is 100  backed by cash and physical assets  That s far more ethical and legitimate than  any fractional reserve bank   FYI  China never banned crypto  They d look like drunken fools if they attempted to enforce such a weak policy   FYI  China owns Facebook  they have absolute control of Google  Hollywood  Ports and Logistics  Washington DC and even commercial sports      Your alarm of China     Is very late   You are forgetting the basics  Capitalism does not care about politics  Capitalism is evolutionary positive behavior   You can use any agreed upon trade in any voluntary exchange without third party interference any where in the world   You do not need permission to live your life  You do not need to be so rule following  You ll worry a lot less when you learn to ignore obsolete systems and irrelevant institutions ,1,0

People act like Bitcoin doesn t have a track record   after everything that s happened in the last 10 years  people are still using the same arguments on why it s going to 0   even though we have more Bitcoin tech and infrastructure today than ever before  Not to mention adoption isn t stopping   Bitcoin will continue to do what it does ,1,0
Great analysis,1,1
I understand what you re saying  It s definitely something to keep in mind  But I think people want currency that can t be controlled by central banks ,11,3

The value of the CBDC s are still tied to the value of the underlying fiat currency  If those go into crisis  which they will due to printing people will still need a store of value  So BTC would be the reserve asset  and then currencies via CBDC s would run on TOP of that  The world still needs a stable asset  Michael Saylor explains this really well I encourage you actually hear him out ,27,2

I admire the efforts you put in your videos mate   digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally  it s hard for anyone going against them these days  though from a trader s perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the community works  crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come  lots of people are skeptical on when to buy in the market and whether it isn t too late to buy an asset  when you re holding it could be but when trading its never too late to buy  a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price  bulls or bears   I trade using signals from trade expert Patrick Timothy   with his signals being copied in my trade  I am still growing my holdings daily despite the current market crash   Tim can be reached through his Telegram   patricktims   or what          1585 2018593   for inquiries into profitable trading  ,246,8

Tether is basically counterfeit USD  used to pump BTC  What could possibly go wrong    ,1,0
Regulation has always been the Achilles Heel of crypto  One does not simply let an anonymized payment network go mainstream  That s a Libertarian pipe dream ,4,3
 chillwithSha True  but cash also has inherent limitations  due to it being physical  and it s also not a  payment network   Moving storing laundering large amounts of black market money in the form of cash is a huge challenge  and regulation has evolved over the years to induce maximum friction to that sort of thing happening  Doing so with crypto is basically a breeze  It offers a path of least resistance to organized crime  Thus  it s not in society s interest to just let it go unregulated ,3,
Ok  but isn t cash anonymous   ,1,
Sharing a few opinions   1  The main objective behind creation of cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currency is completely different  While cryptocurrency transactions provide a citizen with full privacy of his her transactions  central digital currency is just another continuous monitoring process government can impose on citizens to track their every step   2  Bitcoin more likely serves the individual interests while central digital currency would serve the interest of only one party that s the government  3  Pegging central digital currencies with cryptocurrencies could be an option  In that way  countries partially may monitor internal transactions while also enabling citizens to make exchange for cryptos and make payments unanimously  Governments will still be able to track that how much an individual have exchanged into cryptos  ,65,6
 Ron Snow more likely ignored  Cryptos use as a speculative asset is extensive but it s use in business transactions is minimal  The government doesn t care how you buy your groceries or even your car  And crypto transactions are not as anonymous as people think due to the network being decentralized and open  The value of crypto is based on perception that it s value based on fiat currencies will increase  When that hypothesis fails over time  the market will respond accordingly ,4,
like the event we are living through right now  there will be more and more events that will ultimately lead to the outcome the video creator presents  new laws and new enforcement techniques ,3,
Full privacy  The Blockchain is public  Once I know your wallet ID I can see everything ,3,
The number of exploitative business practices that will emerge in a decentralized environment  Big Data allows for social political manipulation on large scales for revenue  It is in your best interest for the government to launch Digital Currency  At some point  the data will to large    crypto will be have to be outlawed ,4,

The only problem with this is that the United States isn t going to allow for the one world currency because United States will go to war with anybody trying to drop the price or do without the USD   For instance  Qaddafi   Hussein to name a few meet there death for trying to do without the USD,1,2

Sorry to tell you  but the problem isn t what you think  You ve been fed the big banker propaganda and they like that you don t know the truth  All major world currencies are pegged to the dollar  We are already there  Look up the Breton Woods Agreement  Look up the executive order that President Nixon signed the completely took the dollar of the gold standard in 1971  two years later that country suffered the hell of stagflation  The cabal banker behind the FED were behind taking him out of Qaddafi because he tried to peg his national currency to gold  which makes it real money  They made up story to make him look bad  but his people loved him for how he was making his country better through sound money and used of resources and being independent and sovereign  Question what you think you know    everything ,1,

Why do I have a feeling that with BTC s advantage  and finite supply  banning by some countries will only send it to the moon ,1,3
 87037244 The problem with that argument is how traceable BTC is  how slow the transactions are  I waited two hours  once  and the fact that we don t know who is responsible for its creation coupled with the fact that most of the mining is being done in China and no  I don t think BTC will moon  I think the OG investor whales are already liquidating their accounts and moving it someplace else   Monero stands the best overall chance of succeeding at the moment  As far as a clandestine currency of the  people  goes  It s highly fungible and can be used to convert into anything without a trace  That s really appealing ,1,
Banning in more countries limits its use and demand therefore not sending it to the moon  ,1,

 I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Dr  joe Olsen  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 9 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy  You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM    joehackbtc   ,3,0

I wonder how many people watch his videos for  educational information  lol,6,1
The  network effect  means BTC and ETH are not going anywhere  BTC s fixed supply makes it valuable in the eyes of the holder  Adoption by retail investors and institutions is also what makes those coins valuable  CBDC s will equal the value of an inflationary dollar printing economy with the added bonus of tracking where you spend your government issued digital currency  If anything your video makes it more important to buy and hold BTC because of the impending issuance of CBDC s    Remember  The government wants to keep the middle class and the poor where they are forever  laying down and accepting CBDC s without waking up and investing in crypto will help them accomplish their goal   Lastly  the CIA uses cryptocurrencies to finance and support their dark ops missions in other countries  The decentralized nature of crypto is exactly what they need  Try telling them that CBDC s will be all that they can use in the near future and see how well that goes ,1,1

One year later a new video with title   Why bitcoin is going to be ZERO  SERIOUSLY  ,6,1
I disagree with the stable coin argument  We would be in the same situation with stablecoins that were in with US dollars  There would be an infinite supply of currency from the gov t hyperinflating  economies and stealing people s wealth  At least with a Digital Currency there is a finite supply and a distributed ledger where the people can keep track and make sure nobody s illegally manipulating the market ,25,4
You what happen when you have the finite supply  Economics dont works  people will delay to buy stuff  it will create deflation and the price keep dropping  supply alot  but less demand  business died,1,
He just ignored that decentralized currencies don t get their value by being a payment system  Zhey get their value by being a possibility for people to store value ,1,2
I know it is just a clickbait title but with around 20 percent lost coins  BTC   including satoshis 1 million btc  that never moved from the address  coins transacted to the wrong blockchain  mined on private pcs and then got stucked in a nicehash account  it is summing up  those most probably will never be sold  going to zero or even under 10 000 dollars after being over 60 000 dollars is just hardly possible  Add the  rare but existing  ultrahodlers  Max Kaiser  who are in gather mentality  where bitcoin got more precious than anything else and you reach a possible price floor around 14 000 dollars  Might be a little too optimistic but close  And Tether is not printed out of thin air  That s it ,1,2
Now it seems total nonsense  Comparing Stable coin to Bitcoin is itself making you a big joke ,2,1

The safest and cheapest way for governments to issue their own digital coins is by tokenizing them on the Bitcoin that Satoshi envisioned  today in the form of BSV  which is ready  already  to massively scale and compete with the old payment and data systems  All data and money get traceable  unhackable  pseudonymous  not anonymous   auditable  on a public ledger that acts as a global source of truth originally built to incentivize honesty ,1,0
Seems like all the downsides for decentralized crypto are simply the same downsides currently for fiat currency  Implying that s the fault of crypto makes no sense to me  What am I missing ,1,0
He appears to be talking sense    Crime using people to transfer Bitcoins or any highly traded crypto which has value in the market and liquidity   without getting traced just by asking the person to send it to some wallet will become the order of the day since it is not regulated and is decentralised    So all these may see the downfall of Bitcoin  Just my view  may be wrong but I dont own any bitcoins   Cheers,1,0

He doesn t understand bitcoin at all lol  It s like 2017 all over again lol  He is right that CBDC is not crypto  it is just Fiat based coin  The reason people buy btc is not because they want to revolutionize payment system  they want a trustless  permissionless  hard asset  The more CBDC or stablecoins become relevant in our lives  the more bitcoin will thrive because they can just exchange small amount of btc every time they want to buy something with it ,1,1

Yes you missed Bitcoin Satoshi Vision  BSV  which is the original Bitcoin  a decetralized universal ledger  The price of BSV doesn t matter because it is only relevant to the use of the network  All the apps being built upon BSV are within the law  not outside the law like BTC  BCH  ETH  XRP etc  ,1,1
That was excellent  thank you for your perspective ,5,1
If this is a manipulation attempt  good luck buddy  You re not elon,1,1
The only problem I see right now is the US government really has no problem with how much you make or what you do unless you don t give them there cut and the government has a big problem with bitcoin investors because they are not giving the government there 40  thanks to your new president that s right 40  ebay was running wild for close to 20 years government said  we will shut this site down today unless you 1  Collect the sales tax and give us all the information on every single seller with a yearly transaction over 20k and if you can t provide that we shut it down  They can t get any of that information from bitcoin so it s like a time bomb  If everyone pays their taxes bitcoin will be around forever  If the u s  Gov is not profiting from bitcoin it doesn t need to exist ,1,0
Man you got this a little wrong,2,1
For me government intervention is bullish for crypto   ,1,1
My take from this vid   1  You really are obsessed with Facebook  2  You have no idea what you re talking about  Which might explain why you were fired from Facebook  3  Your merchandise looks extremely cheap ,1,1
Who said YouTubers aren t in on the Manipulation    ,74,5
 MAX KRYPTO Yeah   Really   So Johnnie can t share his opinion on manipulation   People in society get along with having different opinions    It s not only the Youtubers who have opinions  Use your own logic ,1,
 MAX KRYPTO I hate to be the 1 to tell you  but  your response reads pretty silly  Especially  if you DO NOT believe YouTubers are being compensated to play Devil s Advocate in regards to thee entire Crypto Market Manipulation Scheme ,1,
So it s manipulation if you have a different opinion  don t make it a cult  People in society no longer accept that others can share different opinions and still get along,7,
  DUMP YOUR BITCOIN NOW    This advice has been brought to you  courtesy of Communist China   ,99,15
You guys are acting like children  just hoping that bitcoin will make you money as a tradable asset   Less that 1  of you want it to be a usable currency  you just want to make money on the market   How   By trading it for fiat   So you guys try your  rah rah go team  bullshit over and over   Is Bitcoin worth a lot   Yes   Can you make money on it   Yes   Is it a   Good Idea         NO   ,4,
Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation  but it is also a critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger  It is performed using very sophisticated computers that solve extremely complex computational math problems ,12,10
Despite all the economic crisis  this is still good time to start up  an investment,1,
What will those CBDC be backed by so that their values are not inflated away like fiats ,2,0
7 15  again  it s not anonymous  You can track all transactions,18,4
 Arvind Puryag the same way you can t restore gold and silver that s lost  Does that mean they re dangerous investments  No    You just keep them in a safe place ,2,
But can u restore bitcoin if u lost it  Once u lose it so u lose it no one will be able to help u This is the danger of bitcoin,1,
Except a wallet adress cannot necessarily be linked to the holder  Sooo    ,3,

They are letting crypto run to bring humanity on board with the concept but once all the bugs are worked out the Nuvus Ordo Seclorum will create and issue their own crypto coin that is the official store of wealth of the world and each entity will be issued a number that will be needed to buy or sell and no  person  without their number will not be allowed to buy or sell                ,1,1
You are wrong  LOL CBDC yeah  is the future of the Fiat money of the Central banks  but i stuied Finance and you missed all important things about the history and how the goverment have been using fiat like a weapon  in fact against their own population  inflation  transfer the money from poor people to the rich  and Bitoin fix this problem that have been been with US during thousands of years  yeah  you are wrong ,1,1
 TechLead It seems like the part you might be overlooking is that Bitcoin use case is not to be a currency  And looking at it from a legal standpoint most country s are treating it as an asset  property  like real estate or gold  subject to capital gains  therefore it doesn t make sense to asses it as a currency or to use it to transact  Its real use case is preserving wealth  top level institutions  investors and macro analysts aka people who are much smarter than me believe Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation  Stable coins are great for day to day transactions BUT they do not resolve the main issue we are all facing  the real cause of inequality  inflation    And possibly even Hyper inflation ,20,3
Absolutely spot on  BTC will not be used to make day to day purchases  it s an asset  not a currency as such,2,
I think this reply makes a good counterpoint  Historically people have regarded silver gold plus various collectibles and swap cards as  valuable  Bitcoin might not ever be used to pay for anything I agree but as an asset it has value if people think it does ,4,
The US Dollar will appreciate in value by 10x over the next 3 years mark my words ive never been wrong  as a millionaire  invest in the US dollar ,1,2
Finally found someone else who is seeing what I m seeing  I m nervous for Bitcoin  It s outdated and proving it s not a store a value ,1,0
You re really gonna argue that digital coins pegged to the dollar and other fiat currency will take over for bitcoin       That s such a silly statement that it s not worth further response ,39,5
This guy is a cunning troll,1,
 TheTayz i like your comment      you think they gonna give up their power without a fight    A lot of people didn t think about this tho,2,
Yes  it s unforgivably ignorant  It s like ten hours or less of cryptocurrency education that produces a fumbling utterance about fiat coins being a threat to Bitcoin  Ironically  they only strengthen Bitcoin  The more Stablecoins that exist  the stronger Bitcoin becomes    Now  the first Stablecoin that pegs itself to Bitcoin might supplant Bitcoin as a means of transaction  but the stronger thar coin becomes  the stronger Bitcoin becomes   There s no escape ,2,
Sounded more like he was arguing that central banks and governments have an enormous incentive to maintain the status quo and increase their power by issuing digital currencies and then pushing them onto people by banning legal use of bitcoin or starting to pay in UDSC  etc  You re naive if you think they are going to give up their power without a fight ,22,
Bitcoin is not anonymous but rather pseudonymous and CAN be tracked by governments  Stable coins are tethered to fiat and are the ones to go to zero  BTC s advantage is its fixed supply  In the end it is the perception of the public that will determine winners and losers   just look at Doge coin if you don t believe that ,1,1
Sold BTC to buy doge  ,1,1
Until someone can explain to me how bitcoin isnt decentralized and other coins are  this is all nonsense  Thats the main point that people like him dont seem to understand that   We might as well just digitize the dollar and call it fools coin ,3,1
lol this is an example of how some the smartest people are also the dumbest,1,1
You dont understand bitcoin if you think digital fiat is a threat,2,1
Yeah I think you missed the value prop of bitcoin    it s designed to react to central bank balance sheet expansion    store of value medium of exchange then unit of account that is the route of money and it s path dependent     block chain analysis is also pretty good ,4,1
Meanwhile Nano be like    Transaction Fees  Slow  ,7,1
Why would I want a coin which value is pegged to a currency that prints trillions of dollars at will  Remember Zimbabwe  That s the US dollar future,1,1
well when there is no incentive to mine and the transfer fee is too high  of course people will stop using it  but its not the end all be all of crypto,11,2
Try research Ripple the company and XRP their crypto currency ,1,1

 Bitcoin wipes out all that data  Duh    I begun listening with interest but couldn t continue after this point  Bitcoin s ledger also has all this data  You just have to associate accounts with physical identities  which is already being done   Man  way to lose your credibility ,2,2
Spreading false information  Don t sell your crypto  he is just trying to get views  The same thing happened with crypto in 2017 2018 ,1,0
So basically   I think BTC will crash because it s being used by bad people   Phew  haven t heard that one before    They ve been saying that since day 1  I agree the Tether issue is kinda worrisome but we also have been hearing that for years now  why would the bubble explode all of a sudden ,2,0
How many adverts do you need in a video man ffs  For a start bitcoin is not very anonymous  And the reason people get into crypto I e  bitcoin  other than get rich quick  is because countries endlessly print currency  inflation theift  and stable coins I e  digital dollar etc  will not solve this problem  bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply and does not depend on the fortune or misfortune of a nation or any potential tyrannical government who could in theory switch off your digital currency wallet at any time if you are deemed undesirable by the state  This video was not very thought out ,1,0
You just described all the reasons why no one would want to use CBDCs  All your points just leads to the private coins future ,2,0

Wow this dude is not that bright   Talk about being seriously full of yourself   I guess he will find out the hard way next time BTC hits another ATH    This is why bitcoin is not for everyone  and it certainly was not for this guy   Stock market is what you need bro  keep away from technology you do not understand    Save this video for yourself so that you can see what a fool you are later ,1,0
I think btc will always be an asset  It s simply the first one  It is like art or a great history story  There will always be some rich peops playing and bragging with it  It will be something for the rich to have  It will be difficult and very expensive to get some  So some people will want to have it  Even when it doesn t give them profit ,1,2
Bitcoin with not exist one day  Precious metals will ALWAYS exist ,1,
BTW  I don t have btc or eth  I am only in the stable coin providers  And some nft ,1,
BTC might drop in price  never to 0,1,1
IQ means nothing when it comes to investing,1,0
Makes sense  But their is one thing that I wanted to point out  Some people appreciate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin  specially because they are decentralized and unregulated by a state  For this reason  these people may keep being interested in these currencies  and may not quit them completely for central banks coins ,1,0
One of the best logical reasoning of why bitcoin is going to zero  Well explained  I don t think anyone could ague on these points ,9,3
 Puck Yeah Spread It What are you actually investing into  The idea that the next fool will continue to buy and boost the value ,3,
Not even scratch the surface,2,0

Very simple to understand  The sellers of Bitcoin are accepting dollars yet they are promoting Bitcoin  They will accumulate    and sell dirt to us ,1,0
No stupid  corporation coin  or stable coin will ever be able to replicate the utility of VeChain  ADA or XRP just for some examples      crypto will be built out on  global scale based on one blockchain foundation store of value  limited in supply and decentralized to guard against hyper inflation   gov t financial irresponsibility   so BTC is the frontrunner  then the actual blockchain systems will run on the advanced utility coins    this guy s brain overheated by overthinking every idea that ever entered his brain    he s fried   ,2,0
Scary to think people would allow Facebook to get involved in crypto don t trust that company what so ever thats why id never sign up for Facebook  It s all a front so they can just track people and find out everything you do and what your beliefs are  I have nothing to hide but its just concerning to have a company that would have everything thing about you tracked and where you spend your money  We are already there but don t want a company like Facebook having all that power,1,0
Lol some people are here joking and down playing what he s saying because they have lost a lot of money from BTC or crypto so they need some kind of hope     And are scared  ,1,0
A week after this video this guy made another video where he says he will buy Bitcoin again when it goes down to under  20k  He said he was still bullish about it as it was a good store of value   He s very confused  Checkout his comments around 9 mins 30 seconds in  It s the latest video from him  posted on Saturday  titled Crypto Carnage Bitcoin Bloodbath ,1,0

Bitcoin and most coins are completely traceable and at least us exchanges are under severe surveillance but The us government and most others have become completely illegitimate and have moved at light speed to enslave and destroy its citizens while transferring all wealth and power to the ruling class and it won t be long before nobody cares what the government says or bans or the taxes they impose on their people  people may have cowered in a corner when the banks went bust with the people s money and gold was outlawed but with what s been going on lately nobody is gonna put up with illegitimate government anymore  It may ruin bitcoin but ultimately people will transact with whatever they see as valuable soon,1,0
Lots of butthurt crypto holders in the comments   If the usd coin can tell the IRS and US treasury literally everything that coin was ever spent on  as you say  then they will know EVERYTHING about us   USA will probably ban all other cryptos  like china   Great points but you ll get a lot of hate ,2,2

Hyper inflation  paper money yes is in your hands when it comes to transactions but only had merit because it was backed by what is valuable  gold sliver  Etc  So paper money is only actually paper unless we believe it has value behind it    Well the inflation is going to make it so paper money is once again paper but we need a system on currency to still have control and like that crypto currency comes in and that is the great  reset  crypto currency will be starting from the beginning and physical money is no longer  This is a huge experiment because the theory goes the rich are rich and the poor are poor  If you were to make a poor person rich it would just end up with the rich person once again  They are making a lot ALOT of people rich  we will see if the poor can move up or if the saying is true  This could be a huge turn around if everyone figures out how to multiple their money ,1,0

If governments issued stable coins wouldn t it be the same as their current fiat currencies  Nothing backed by nothing  Thats the whole reason for BTC an others  This would also still allow Gresham s Law to be in play  where bad money  gov  Stable Coins  chase good money  BTC and others  out of the market  therefore making them more sought after and raising their value  You know  like what the dollar did to silver and gold when the US went off the Gold Standard    Usually when things are banned by governments the value of those objects go up ,1,0

Agreed  It will  BTC is totally over as it s useless  it s just a gambling coin now   BSV is the real bitcoin that can be saddled with fiat currency ,1,0
Useful point of view  but I m afraid you have a limited understanding on the subject  Noone is seriously contemplating that BTC or any Altcoins are alternatives to fiat currency   BTC is store of value  ETH  ADA  DOT etc are hypercomputers  substrates to facilitate tokenized wealth and novel financial instruments  VET etc handle macro logistics and FILECOIN STORJ etc are cloud hard drives  Moreover all of the above are facilitating the Web3 0  This technology is already here  it has and should  be capitalized upon    too late to stop it  get on board or get left behind ,1,0

Very logical answer I am with the same point of view specially about criminal behaviour with cryptocurrencies and the future of competition of digital currencies,1,0
Very intersting and thought provoking  I think most central banks will be looking into creating or buying into a fully tracked crypto system  It will probably be the final nail in the coffin for cash  I terms of Europe all EU countries will use the same crypto so it means full transparency across all EU countries  Plus eventually other blocks of countries ,1,0
The problem with cbdc s is the fact they won t solve the liquidity crisis  Costly and inefficient correspondent banking will be replaced  How  By the supranational  neutral  bridging digital currency called XRP  with the company Ripple leveraging it  Through their partners  300  big banks and central banks  using Ripplenet  XRP will be used for cross border payments  Liquidity will eventually be provided by marketmakers and liquidity pools  Banks will be able to make international payments without trust and leveling the playing field  XRP s value is decided by the market and hence not backed by any nation which makes it the ultimate cryptocurrency of the future  Together with 3 seconds settlements it will open the door towards the internet of value  XRP will be the standard in my humble opinion ,2,1
That sounds like a huge deal Imo  I guess that would work if xrp would exceed a certain market cap to be effective for illiquid corridors like for example The Phillipines and Brazil ,1,

 Rucker Carlson Your 0 04  figure is wrong and includes exchange wallets like binance which holds crypto for over 100 million people  But yes there are some big bitcoin holders and this will probably distribute over time  The USD is mainly possessed by a small amount of people too  Your stable coin theory is also not fact  We don t know how much of tether s market cap is backed by real USD  They say it s fully backed and they have been investigated by US authorities and they have never made any charges  I personally do not hold stable coins  Even if they do lend out some of it  that s no different to a traditional bank which lends out most  if not all of your money as well  You also don t understand the definition of a ponzi  Bitcoin promises no guarantee of returns  It s just an asset that is early in it s adoption ,1,

 Matthew Castillo You keep mentioning to people that they don t understand blockchain technology    In your biased  closed minded opinion  what are the inherent flaws they fail to see in blockchain technology specifically ,3,
 Matthew Castillo If you mean reverse crashing you would be right  Keep your money in USD and enjoy losing 7 25  of it s purchasing power every year,2,
 David Certainly possible but seems unlikely now that regulators have allowed publicly listed companies to buy BTC as an asset and also allowed banks to build crypto products  although none have yet  but must surely be in the works   There s also a Canadian ETF and plenty of highly regulated financial institutions buying BTC,1,
 Matthew Castillo Man  we the people have to have more power than a tiny bunch of people  You seem to be surrendering already to them which is a big mistake  We the crypto hodlers are not giving up  We are not surrendering  If we fall  the we fall fighting ,2,
I think hes saying the US treasury will ban crypto like china and would love all that coin history in the usd coin,1,
 Jake H   Sounds like your the one who is new to the crypto market  Apparently you know nothing about blockchain technology  Cryptos are crashing as we speak  Next year they will be down significantly  Why do you think Facebook hasn t moved forward with its cryptocurrency Libra ,2,
 Matthew Castillo You must be new to crypto  China has banned bitcoin every year since 2016  Has that stopped bitcoin being used by Chinese people  No  Has it stopped the price appreciating  No  There s only so much control a government can have over a decentralized currency  The tax situation in the US is why I don t like bitcoin as a currency  also no one would want to spend an appreciating asset   I see bitcoin as digital gold  but not a total replacement as I believe it s always smart to diversify in case of a black swan event   Even with the increased tax  you only pay tax on capital gains  It still performs better than any asset in history  Bitcoin mining causes much less pollution than Gold mining or the current financial system as I already said  and it s only going to improve with more renewable energy ,7,
 Matthew Castillo what a bunch of silly reasons Bitcoin is doomed  China banned it lol  Tesla doesnt accept it hahahaha  Irs is gonna tax  it newsflash it already is thus making it less likely to be banned  Biden trillion dolla printed from thin air climate plan  Those seem all bullish to me,9,
 Jake H   Damn millennial  You really don t pay attention  China banned all cryptos last year  Elon Musk stopped using Bitcoin as a payment method for Tesla products  The Biden administration is more than doubling capital gains tax on cryptos and stocks  Not to mention Biden is hiring 100 k IRS agents to go after back taxes  There s at least a trillion dollars of unpaid taxes  Biden is spending trillions on climate change  Since mining cryptos causes a lot of pollution which also might be the reason China is banning them  China is the next superpower and have a lot more influence the American ever had  And there s probably a lot more important factors than these just to name a few ,1,
  Matthew Castillo There is nothing unsustainable about Bitcoin  The fact that there are still some coal powered miners isn t directly Bitcoin s fault  It actively encourages renewable energy since that is the cheapest way to mine  eg  last resort hydro power that would otherwise be wasted energy   Renewable miners are gradually taking over and eventually coal miners will be priced out of mining and then you have a fully sustainable system  Bitcoin is also an order of magnitude more efficient than the current financial system  which has layers upon layers  and don t get me started on gold mining   I would love to know the other factors you speak of and what your better solution for preserving wealth in the future is,5,
Apparently you don t understand blockchain technology or the fact that it s unsustainable  Not to mention all the other factors  You really need to Pay attention,2,

 Crustyrat put a timestamp in   he says alot  but at the end he is right btc is a big risk  i was dreaming too i had alot btc but at the end they will do what they did 20 30years ago with gold when it gets too big,1,
The fact he thinks bitcoin is anonymous is all you need to know how deeply man has looked into this,2,
What was he wrong about though  The current establishment has an enormous incentive to maintain their control  Issuing a digital currency to compete against decentralized coins would be a huge powerplay move for govts and central bankers  It makes total sense that they would try this  He didn t say it was a  good  outcome  but a logical one ,4,

You said that no bank in China will allow someone to convert their Bitcoin into Yen  But who says they have  to use a bank to do that  The person from China just simply uses a crypto exchange such as Binance etc   and convert their crypto into fiat currency from within that foreign exchange  Then from there they can transfer it to their bank account in China  Did I miss something  or did you ,1,0
I had to  unfortunately  take the pain to watch this video out of sheer curiosity  11 25 minutes wasted which I wouldn t ever get back ,17,4
  Shaz Ahmad  Out of respect to the content creator  no one is asking you to watch his content if you consider this a waste of time  He ll do just fine with a million of his followers who appreciate him sharing his opinion to which  fortunately  average ppl know they dont have to agree with,4,
Luis Morales He made absolutely ridiculous points IMO   He doesn t understand Bitcoin  Just increasing his views ,2,
He made a good point,3,
HI man  I love your video  right to the poin,1,0
Thanks for all these great videos  TechLead  I click ALL your ads  ,1,0
Good to see you back  the stable coin tracking and opportunity apple pay has is scary for technically getting insider information  on company performance   I don t believe however in bitcoin zeroing  in fact  I can see it perk back up and exceed its all time high  Cryptocurrency has got to be the best thing you can day trade   the market is like an extreme yoyo   Also  not everyone will be happy having everything they purchase tracked  Bitcoin will rise in value because of this  and the fact it is in limited supply proves it to be a good store of value ,1,1
He s just explained why BTC is here to stay,4,0

 Joshua Ableiter what did he say about his ex wife  And why does that make him a  dirtbag   Doesn t almost everyone trash talk their ex ,2,
Strange arguments  Am I missing something   isn t it a FEATURE of BTC that it s not pegged to a inflationary fiat  The logic in this video should lead to the opposite conclusion  USD is going to zero while BTC appreciates ,4,
I am thinking that there are too many rich and powerful people that are so deep into BTC that they will put up a very good fight if all the governments of the world tried to ban it                potentially a significant number of those rich people deep in BTC being top government officials of course ,4,
They may be able to stop individual cryptos  but never all cryptos  Go where the freedom is,1,
He also used to trash talk his ex wife in his YouTube videos  this dude is a real dirtbag  However  his technical knowledge and experience is invaluable ,5,
 Jeff Inglestat damn it  BTC is really too good to be true  That bieng said the elites  the powers that be are never going to allow  the people  the ability  the peace of mind against inflation and the POWER to control thier own currency  to control thier own lives  Aarrgghh   this really pisses me off  It s going to get alot darker before the people say enough in a singular voice   ,8,
You re doing EXACTLY what the puppet masters want you to do by missing the forest for the trees  Yes  the timing of getting out of crypto is not now  or you d be a fool  but in the long run  if FIAT goes from cash  decentralized  to digital  centralized which means controlled by government  you will loose your decentralized investments  if they decide to ban them  and it would be easy for them to do because they d be able to enforce it  Dudes  you have to take this seriously and think about it  not because you need to worry now  but in a few years you might be in serious trouble  Just make sure you understand this and support voices and people that stand against it ,17,
hahah,3,
did you listen to the video   It was the one crypto currency he owned that wasn t being pumped by tether ,7,

Questions  Why would anyone want this kind of future  Why would anyone want this future where central banks would be able to track all of your transactions  Why would people want to participate in this    And I don t think bitcoin is turning out to be a currency as in you re not supposed to buy things with your bitcoin  because you risk that bitcoin one day being worth a lot more in the future and not to mention  when you buy things with your bitcoin  you incur a taxable event  An actual viable strategy would be to buy and hold your bitcoin and use it as a hedge against inflation like say  how gold is used now  In fact  we bitcoin holders believe bitcoin will challenge the market cap of gold one day in the future    And also  if stablecoins are pegged to a country s currency  then if that country inflates their currency  then the stablecoin will go down with the currency  And that s why you tie your wealth to bitcoin over stablecoins ,1,0
Comparing stablecoin to crypto futures is like comparing usd to gold imo  Agenda at play,82,2
gold was banned alot of times  the same will happend to crypto if its gets too big  i hold a little bit of ada xrp but not for long,3,
Regardless of what happens in the end  central banks aren t going to hand over their power easily ,239,48
 christopher Macabre probably have a lot more resources too   not that the uh 10 000 neck beards and 20 year old  entre bro neur s  don t have vast political capital at their hand and centuries of entrenched power structures ,1,
A lot of you are missing the fact of how bitcoin and other defi work   If govts create a digital currency it will result exactly like our current fiat  they will issue more and we ll be subject to inflation  deflation  and all the other BS   There is a need for change   Crypto didn t just pop up and remain here bc ppl wanted it  its bc we NEED it  If we re going to live in a word where we exchange goods and services for currency then we have to get away from fiat ,2,
  The globalists and bankers have think tanks that create goals and plans that fit there agendas such as the destabilization of smaller countries with there devalueing dollars  and pegging them to there central bank system  its there global agenda to enslave ALL economies under there money system ,1,

 Matthew Castillo maybe     Or maybe not  Time will tell ,1,
 Matthew Castillo you keep banging on about all of them will crash  what you don t understand is that there is only one  Bitcoin is so damn hard to kill  you really need to study it inside out to understand how hard it is  Infact you can never really kill it because it is an ideology  It is freedom  You can keep your current views and not embrace btc  but I warn that by doing this you are inversly opting for inevitable oppression and totalitarian rule  Is that really what you want  Because btc will succeed if enough people know what it can do for the world and how important it is to restrict absolute power of govt  Most people want freedom right  Like really ask yourself that  and think about that   Because the great thing with btc is that no central entity can kill it at this stage  they have missed their window  and the people will decide what they want to trade in  By people i m also talking about govt reps  congressmen  they are people too with kids and fmaily and they better than most know full well the dangers of where cbdc are heading ,1,
 Matthew Castillo  china has banned like 30 times now  Catch up ,2,
 Matthew Castillo El Salvador just became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender  Paraguay is up next  Soon  many other countries will follow suit  This is bullish for cryptocurrencies ,1,
 Matthew Castillo you re a fool as your comments haven t held up well  Bitcoin is back on the rise  and altcoins are following  I can guarantee BTC will surpass its all time high of 64K  Not only have I been holding my cryptos  I bought a lot more during the dip and have seen nice profits  Go ahead and hold onto your decreasing USD  You must love inflation ,2,
You don t understand the definition of  poor  apparently  being poor means lacking money to live comfortably or having the basic needs  How on earth is 400k poor  thats 6 times the average US yearly income  Investing in crypto is not thinking like the poor  it is saving your hard earning money in an asset that will increase in value over time and because we are still so early with the crypto adoption there is still massive upside   I do not know you  I don t need to know you but what I do know is that you should take education and learn some basic economics instead of coming up with stupid thoughts ,1,
 Matthew Castillo Quite bold to make such a claim without any evidence  Your statement on only the poor and middle class holding is just plain incorrect  There are multiple high value investors and companies entering the crypto scene ,2,
 Matthew Castillo Honestly most Bitcoin holders couldn t care less about the volatility or the influence Elon Musk has  they will still hold Bitcoin and other crypto s  And who cares if it loses half of it s value  Bitcoin is deflationary and will retain its value over the long term  China has banned crypto s  oh boohooo it has done so in 2017 and look at where we are now  Once countries start accepting cyrpto s and other countries realise they don t want to be left behind because of the scarcity in deflationary currencies we can change the system  And all the CBDC s are the same inflationary currencies we have been using for years  but with a different name  we don t want the inflationary bullshit anymore we don t need the totalitarian control of the goverment to transact ,3,
 yourignoranttube Pretty sure Michael Saylor and Max Kaiser won t let that happen  ,3,
 Matthew Castillo    China mines 50  of Bitcoin so if you can t decider propaganda from the CCP  China band Bitcoin   laughable  then of course you would take this uneducated view ,4,
 christopher Macabre If you think the federal reserve had more intellectual technical geniuses then blockchain crypto  I m not sure you understand what s going on in the space right now     The federal reserve will simply have no choice but to accept that crypto is changing the face of currency  and many ppl will follow ,3,
Nothing last forever  Everything changes it just takes time no one wants to wait ,3,
I smell weak hands,2,
 Matthew Castillo do some research on xrp and you ll know what Steven bond is talking about  Xrp is legit being used by banks and is the only crypto that banks are using and testing  and they have a lot of partnerships  They have a network and it would be so stupid if xrp was removed when it s good for the economy for the future don t see xrp dying besides Bitcoin and the other coins  XRP has too many good fundamentals,2,
 The Paladin Family   You re a fool for holding  Just the fact that China has banned cryptos is enough to influence the market  Elon Musk also has Major influence  Apparently you never watched the movie Wall Street  ,1,
Yes  Either way they are gonna control the world because they can  If they can t ban crypto  they are gonna buy the way in like it s happening now  Once they own most of BTC and regulate all the exchanges its game over ,7,
 Matthew Castillo read read read china banned cryptos four times its part of the game    Just HODL,15,
 Steven Bond   You re a fool if you think buying any cryptos are a good investment and a greater fool if you are holding  All cryptos are crashing  Apparently you re not paying attention to what going on  China has banned all cryptos ,8,
 Steven Bond what if you can beat em though,10,
If you can t beat em  join em  Buy XRP  Banks are already adopting CBDCs  central bank digital currencies   Ripples  XRP will be used to bridge these currencies across borders ,16,
Facts ,6,
This is something everyone should agree on  and they have people far smarter than the average player in the game  ,23,
Lmao  You just made a strong case for the reasons exactly why we need crypto      This is what happens when you when you take 5 hours to research about something ,58,3
Just watched this thinking exactly the same   like   does he not understand WHY it s not just digital assets   it s DECENTRALIZED assets ,4,
He will endlessly keep on thinking why b c is going to zero  ,4,

Disclaimer  I stopped watching at the 2 15 mark  If you think stablecoincs or CBDCs are going to make bitcoin go to zero than you don t know anything about bitcoin and what it s fighting for  There s nothing different between our current financial system and CBDCs  Maybe  more centralized   It s going going to be the same story  Your take won t age well ,1,1
Ah man  I guess the 12 786 Bitcoin I own will become worthless  Guess I better sell now then  Thanks for the heads up ,1,1
I m coming back to this video in 10 years ,1,0
seems like you completely failed to understand that BTC has a fully transparent ledger  and that every transaction can be traced  and with the coining of data using AI  the CIA can easily tell the owner of a wallet just based on the confirmation of a single transaction  which means that if you buy anything even just once  or if you are part of a KYC project which is necessary for all major exchanges  then your identity is clear  and transferring from one wallet to another is traceable  This is why CIA loves Crypto currency like BTC  its the privacy coins like Monero XMR which they fear   Having such a strong opinion with so little information is hubris ,1,0
you are a FUD Superspreader,2,1

Good points  but there s so much FUD  I can only imagine as more people wake up to the idea of decentralization  they would want to move away from centralized currency lol  I dont see much of a future for centralized stablecoins  it s cringey and corny as hell  I think a lot of drama will unfold and we are living thru some exciting times and paradigm shifts ,17,5
 SCUD correct    The only reason the USD hasn t collapsed is the hostage take over of oil fields which we then force everyone to only use USD to purchase oil    The USD is backed by war and oil  I don t think it s gonna last ,2,
Why do you expect the central bank s digital currency is going to change anything  We already have digital money platforms right now such as Zelle  Quickpay  Venmo  Paypal  Google Pay  Stable coins  and Bank electronic transfers  Those platforms are much better than the central bank s digital currency in many ways  You have to understand the central bank s digital currency and digital money platforms are the same things so they complete with each other  But  the central bank s digital currency and Cryptocurrency is a different target group  Please  don t confuse with blockchain technology ,1,0
Impossible  if it did I would buy loads of it,1,0
With paper money  they printed so much it is inflating to infinity at this point    You think some government backed digital currency will be any better   When they can mint billions with minimal effort   IMHO the purpose of a currency is to efficiently correlate with some effort or work that I do  If that is not possible  then it will be equally useless ,1,0
you are incorrect   the bitcoin network will successfully resist any and all attempts to shut it down ,1,2
What if I told you that you can buy central bank digital currency with Bitcoin ,1,0
Thank you for outlining the investment thesis for BTC   stable coins are derivatives of a broken fiat system that is going to zero in real terms  The best way for a free flowing economy to function is to allow information to flow unencumbered and independent of central authorities    Take the exact inverse of what this guy is saying and you get a Crypto backed financial system that is far more efficient and dynamic  The internet flourished because governments were too unsophisticated to regulate it  Crypto will triumph for the same reasons  Diamond hands everyone ,1,0
At that point  our normal fiat currency would be better at that anyways  It would still give control to the govt without publicising all transactions ,1,0

Fantastic video          The major challenges investors face may range from controlling impulsiveness to the frail of compulsion  Most newbies and would be investors often undermine and most often neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading  Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market  Essentially  the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements  I would encourage investors out there to trade with the little they have or copy trade alerts from a professional trader as I have been doing with Tony konrad strategy daily signals since the last bear market  increasing my portfolio daily  With his stra egy signaIs  I have been able to grow my portfolio to about   100K with an initial   20K  Tony konrad makes you learn while earning massively  He can be contacted via  e egram    Tktrade7    on how to trade crypto profitably ,45,8

You r right bro    I don t even know why this channel is even existing    I mean just look at him  his face is so depressing    The way he talks and everything    Idk why people still watch him,1,
You make some great points  though I think you are missing somethings  i e  layer2 solutions  altcoins  etc    I think the crypto market is a lot bigger than Bitcoin  and that will undermine CBDCs  but beyond that  private markets move faster than governments  so you can expect cryptos to move around regulation as long as there is a free market somewhere ,2,0
What a troll lmao,1,0
The biggest ponzi scheme we have is fiat currency    and it survived 50 years,1,0
 David Koziar thank you for the compliment  Regarding bitcoin  a reserve asset doesn t need to be moving at trillions of transactions per second  It only needs to sit in a savings account and do precisely nothing  As in point 1  Bitcoin is not a replacement for fiat as a transactional currency  it s a replacement for all stores of value  primarily 401k s and equity    The lack of a proper container for value over mankind s history has lead to certain assets being monstrously overpriced    Stocks  for example  are meant to be cash flow vehicles  except we have so much extra money that they have effectively become glorified baseball cards  When a  normal  P E ratio for an average tech stock rockets into the 40 s I think it s safe to say nobody is buying stocks for the cash flow anymore    Real estate is meant to be lived on  except due to being used as a surrogate piggy bank it has grown into a cost of living crisis    Gold is supposed to be a commodity  except due to being used as another surrogate piggy bank it is massively overpriced as a production input  making all of the relevant goods we buy on a regular basis artificially overpriced  There is no shortage of gold for any reason other than man s tendency to misuse and hoard it as a substitute for money    Bitcoin however is the purest form of money that has ever existed  It does absolutely nothing but contain value in such a way that everyone can count on it still being there the next day  despite the initial volatility that s natural for any form of newly established money  It does not need to be transactional to fulfill this purpose   Monero is chasing privacy  and in my opinion this is neither desirable from a practical perspective  nor wise from a regulatory perspective  as it is pure antagonization of the government  Not necessary  not beneficial to society  and not generally smart imo   ADA is a generic replacement for ETH  as will be the next competitor to ADA  and the next  and the next  and the next    The thing about blockchain is  it s free  Aside from being completely cost ineffective and unreliable as a way to handle paperwork  Ethereum  ADA  etc are only selling people overcomplicated engineering under the guise of future utility  except in my view  smart people don t worry about what other people might want eventually  Smart people focus on what they themselves actually need  and what actually works  today  I have about 12 reasons I haven t even listed for why ETH is terrible  but I ve already written a novel here,1,
 China knows what s up   Oh  so you don t have any credibility ,13,1
Stable coins are pinned to  us dollars  when inflation comes in  the dollar looses value  so the coin looses value    we need a currency that has a limited supply to battle oversaturation    bitcoin has limited supply and cant be diluted,3,4
we already do  its called gold   ,2,

 Jo o Santos   Well  at least you were warned   don t complain when Bitcoin and all other cryptos drop to zero  ,1,
 Matthew Castillo just chill   Sell your bags and move on  Bitcoin is not going to zero  crypto is here to stay ,10,
 Jo o Santos   Damn millennial  You re wrong  They are only a speculation asset  The government is coming out with it s own digital currency  Once that happens all cryptos will be worthless  They are already crashing for various reasons  I bet you can t list some of the reasons  ,4,
 Matthew Castillo crypto goes up a lot  goes down a lot  but going to zero    Not gonna happen  Crypto is here to stay ,9,
 Jo o Santos   I have some cryptos  I haven t sold mine yet  Was hoping maybe they might go up a little ,1,

Sounds like stable coins have all of the disadvantages of fiat currency with none of the annoying advantages ,271,22
What about stablecoins backed by Gold ,1,
China will allow crypto again  Bitcoin is still bought and sold by people in china  Also mined  When something becomes illegal it makes it more desirable ,2,
  This guy is clueless  This theory applies to China  sure  because they don t allow their citizens any meaningful control of their lives     certainly not with their finances  Imagine their citizens putting their BTC in cold storage   hey presto  no control    no wonder they banned it as a totalitarian regime    Regimes like this have one goal   to maintain the regime   that s it ,2,
 mrzack888 if it allows the unbanked to bank  I m all for it as an OPTION ,1,
 I ll Be True Official He s just explained it   they can be tracked at every transaction unlike cash which cannot be tracked at every transaction ,1,
I get 10 percent apy on my stable coins though  That s the best advantage of a stable  Its enough to pay my rent every month but I compound it,5,
WRONG   stable coins via central bank digital currency bypasses banks   Meaning you can be in a rural area and not have a bank account and still have access to a checking savings account and use it for commerce   China s digital coin you can also transact with others without needing internet ,2,
they are created by bundling   of different assets to balance the price of the stable coin value   it represents 10  Nike 10  Tesla ect  the   can be changed in the bundle to keep the value of the cbdc stable,1,
Broooo your making the assumptions that crypto isnt a scarce asset unlike your company coins  Right  If something like visa backs company coins then it will be backed by credit  Which in collapse  inflation  scenarios is worth as much as usd  Also your banking on countries being Authoritarianism like china in their introduction of legislation  When the innovative lead the support will follow in the right direction let s hope for dear god ,1,
 Noah to a certain extent it already happened with everything cash almost completely being phased out  It s just that now the information is more scattered around and hard to analyze ,1,
Yah it is the same as flat currency   I government coin wouldn t be a threat to bitcoin because the purpose of bitcoin is it is a non government controlled currency,15,
 I ll Be True Official its handy but yoz practically loose all financial independence  freedom and privacy to the gov  ita a truely distopian vision  much more distopian than if everything would be decentrelized and a few hacker try to attack some people,11,
 I ll Be True Official The only advantage is the government can see everything you spend money on   It s an advantage for those in government  not for you   And any hacker that comes along   Oh  it ll be grand ,31,
The end makes a ton sense  about each country having their own currency coin  however bitcoin going to zero   It makes a ton of sense the value drops  as you can t use it if other countries make their own  currency      Bitcoin going to zero    Not likely imo ,1,0
Stable coins infinite supply   No different from paper bills ,1,0
I think you missed the whole point of Bitcoin  Decentralized  limited supply  privacy  store of value and nobody can banned it until there is internet in the world ,73,26
Bitcoin doesn t protect privacy though in fact it s public ledger makes transactions even easier to trace for anyone who wants to do it    Limited supply on its own doesn t guarantee that something is valuable either  there is a limited supply of old Nintendo entertainment system cartridges but it s not like every single one of those games is valued at a higher level adjusted for inflation than it initially sold that in fact some are much lower    I honestly think the fanaticism and ignorance of the average crypto user will continue to drive the price up for quite some time but at the same time it s appalling how little most  know about their own investment  for some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin I don t think they really have a long term future  for others like aetherium who s smart contract capability actually give them use cases I think they may have a future but at the end of the day it s just speculation so i can see why boomers stick to stonks ,1,
 Sandman Fu And  using cash has more privacy than any crypto ,1,
Stop repeating what other are saying  Why do you want limited supply  also here is news  Owner of bitcoin can increase supply anytime   Privacy  really  are you using your money to deal drugs  why are you worry about someone knowing you bought apple juice from Walmart  Ban   Ban US currency  Store of value ,1,
 ThePhilosopher i meant LOL   bitcoin being Decentralized  It pretty much has proven to be centralized by China,1,
When they shut down your internet  guess you can go into digital space and grab your bitcoins huh  Already got you in checkmate and you don t even know it ,1,
 Richard Lazo I m not sure if you re trying to reply to someone else  If you re replying to me  i never said BTC is centralized  Legacy Finance is going to make their own  that ll work along with BTC just like other Crytpo s  They re hijacking it and ppl are in denial ,1,
 Aaron Young   Catalyst  You can almost compare what they are doing to the housing market creating products out of bad loans  ,2,
Lel  privacy  you can track each transaction on the Chain  EACH TRANSACTION,1,
Think your on to something here but I think this was becoming obvious  What s worth more investigation is the alt coins  They are now crypto  When they are project or business based then what s your take on them   They are just stocks turned to coins right  What s your opinion ,2,
No one thinks about how every time a new coin comes out the creators somehow have already  mined  a huge amount of the coin they are now offering      Of course they want you to buy and hype it up     It helps them cash out on something they created out of nothing    ,4,
But it doesnt have privacy  it precisely shows every transaction ever ,2,
They are going to dry it out over time   The normal internet is more and more controlled by the very big players  China cut it s people out  russia in the making and we are going to face similar strutures step by step  All big countries are already in the making of these new digital centralbank currencies  First they push for full digitalisation and dry out cash money paying and some day they are going to do a currency move in the new digital central bank money  And then it is easy to forbid cryptos and metals like gold  simply not being able to change it in the new currency and because no cash no shadow economy like in historic days   Some super technial  experienced people will be still able to bypass it but huge majority of 80  not and that is enough in number to implement the new structures ,4,

Yes  the whole reason I went into crypto was so my money could not get tracked  Why would I want a government to know what I do with my money  Only a fool or a Chinese would want to use a national digital coin that can be tracked by their government ,1,0
I heard your point but I think you totally missed the bitcoin value proposal and that why no stable coin can win against bitcoin  here you just took a particular case but bitcoin is more resilient than that  That s not something governments can stop,1,0
