Love your videos and you re definitely my new go to sifu for information  However  most of the actions you recommend are not for new investors with small amounts of money   1000  looking to leverage crypto  Your advise seems to be focused on established investors with lots of money to play with  This isn t a slight on you  again  I love your videos but I want to know how to participate in crypto as a  normal  human who doesn t have thousands of dollars laying around to play with  Just a regular person  working a decent job trying to squirrel away some money in different assets including crypto ,1,1

 I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling  Tradlng went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 2 BTC when I started at 1 5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Jayson Elwood  I would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about  ,187,7

I want to personally apologize to the Shib community  No sooner did I buy my 100 million tokens when the market then collapsed  I accept full responsibility  I am not sure how  but somehow I crashed the crypto market  The timing is just too coincidental  Of course  I could sell everything and restores sanity to the world of crypto  but I just can t bring myself to sell at a loss  But at least now I have said it  It is my fault  I just had to get it off my chest ,1,0

The best way to find growth stocks  key features to keep in mind is as follows  1  Ensure gross margins are greater than 50  2  Ensure P E ratio is less than 100 3  Buy companies that are PROFITABLE  very important irrespective of sector  4  Debt to equity ratio is less than 30  5  Current ratio is above I 6  and a Float under 100 million One stock that fits the bill is FLGT  Fulgent ,29,23

Bitcoin recent price action shows evidence that a bottom may be forming   denying bears any further movement lower  Ethereum price has developed a ridiculously extended hidden bullish divergence condition on its weekly chart  warning of an imminent bullish reversal  XRP price hammered with two major short setups  but sellers failed to push XRP lower  At this point Diamond hands are showing cracks as people start to panic  if you are losing in the current dip or you look forward to start the best way to go is trading with the guidance of an expert  Tracy Goodman has been one step ahead of other analysis  with her strategy I was able to accumulate 15 BTC in 3weeks ,51,10

While bitcoin s wild  price movements might seem random  they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets  Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance  it s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin   Keeping all this in mind  it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world  kathleen  rife Signals has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 19 BTC lately ,2,1

 CRYPTO CURRENCY IS THE FUTURE INVESTING IN IT WILL BE THE WISEST THING TO DO ESPECIALLY WITH THE CURRENT PRICE NOW  ,30,42
  I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Hudson Owen ,94,5

Hey  neat to see Charge show up on your channel   Worth noting  the APR you were show casing for static BUSD was if you use the farm  if you actually stake it for 48 hours in the boardroom   the APR is a decent amount higher  even when under peg  A lot higher when above peg and static expansions are actually happening   I am more interested in accumulating Charge holdings over time than just trying to grind out    through static busd LP compounding on itself  but that s just me ,4,2

Most wise investors with crypto uses the opportunity of when there is a drop in the market to buy and day trade with a working strategy and a plan to navigate the market system using the low price in the market to trade daily speculating the increase in price  Get a working plan today for that profit making  fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is the right time to invest   Before jumping into a conclusion I think you should take a look at things first for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can t tell if its going bearish or bullish  while others still continues to trade without fear of losing  others are being patient  For me trading has been going well because I use a day trading system that helps me with signals Get a working strategy with the help of an Expert  Mr Armstrong whom with since late last year  I have been in the last 2 groups  but with the assistance of Armstrong whose trades I have been copying for over 8months now  netting in more than 8 5btc in profit already  Learning never ends and I am still doing so with Armstrong  He can be reached on telegram   Goldsfolio  STAY SAFE  ,65,0
