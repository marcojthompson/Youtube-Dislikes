If there is one thing I have learned recently about  cryptocurrency is to remain calm  especially when it comes to Bitcoin  Learn not to sell in a panic when everything goes down and not to buy in euphoria when everything goes up  It took me years to truly feel comfortable charting and it s not really something you can take a class to learn so many times emotion comes into play  the true successors of day trading are the non emotional investors with small consistent strategies goals  I advise y all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses  The market is not predictable and you can not tell if it s going bearish or bullish  While myself and others are trading  without fear of making  loss others are being patient for the price to come up  It all depends on the platform  you trade with  I was able to make 1 6BTC from 0 3BTC  by implementing trades and  information  from Mr Christian   he guild and  trade for  newbie who don t understand how trading  work  You can  reach him on Tele gram    christian uk for any crypto info ,3,0

As a newbie about to invest  you must have these three things in mind 1  Have a long term mindset    2  Be willing to take risk  3  Be careful on money usage  if you re not spending to earn back  then stop spending  4  Never claim to know   Ask questions and it s best you work with a financial advisor   I made it as a newbie by working with Alex Valentino and today I can show alot of my achievements ,230,15

You should talk about how Coin Market Cap LIES   They don t actually list coins by consistent rules   Look at what happens when you get past the second third page   They don t rank coins correctly  They put coins that BINANCE doesn t like down below their correct ranking  even if they re good    Binance owns Coin Market Cap  hence  people are only being shown the coins that BINANCE wants them to see   Take a look  tell me I m wrong ,2,1

I totally share your oppinion about Bitcoin and all the rest  In the long run all that will be left will be Bitcoin  maybe one or 2 more and the rest will be stablecoins  Money has 3 functions 1   way of transaction   all cryptos  some more slowly than others  do this functions and even the superslow BTC is getting faster and faster due to all hubs  layers and all the interconnectivity being built up there   2   unit of measure   all cryptos really suck in this except for stablecoins  3   Reserve of value   I can only see Bitcoin and stablecoins doing this function  but maybe one or two future coins will do this  So yes you are absolutelly right  thank you so much for consolidating my trending oppinion  Ahh and one more magical thing about BTC   it is not owned by anyone  New fan from Portugal,1,0

Could someone please explain to me how buying Bitcoin today  is any different from buying a random stock in terms of an investment  Seriously  could someone please explain this to me   This is how I look at it  There is zero guarantee that Bitcoin specifically will be the crypto of the future  There is zero inherent value in Bitcoin itself  it s not an asset   It is as volatile as anything  What am I missing could someone please explain ,1,0
I literally just watched a video of yours saying Bitcoin is going to zero  How can we take you seriously man ,2,0

Greeting everyone    Staying calm through the daily market price changes isn t an easy feeling to bottle in  although I still strongly believe BTC is going to enter the  70k SD record before its year ends  although that s my personal opinion  A lot of my friends who are holders are currently going crazy over the sudden drop in price and a follow up rise  Firstly  you aren t supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts   price  This is a good realization I worked towards correcting early last year  so it was never second guessing when an opportunity as crypto trading came my way  With much energy channeled into trading bitcoin daiIy with the guide of an expert via graphical and statistical signals    my portfolio went from approximate 3 2Bitcoin to 34 4Bitcoin within a year  I will always suggest to newbies or old holders  Trade with an expert people  It is truly easy  only requires your time and guide with a mentor like Gomez  And he can be reached via telegram   Goldsfolio   STAY SAFE    ,111,0

The stock market has been a really tough one this past months  but I watched an interview on CNBC where the anchor kept mentioning     BELLA ADAMS      This prompted me to get in touch with her  and from October 2021 till now we have been working together  and I can now boast of  540k in my trading portfolio ,52,24
Wow  Kubler Ross  Where d that come from   I would never have guessed I would  see her on a tech channel ,1,0
Has your opinion on bitcoin changed since you posted this ,2,0
I heard Bitcoin was going to 100 000 by December of 2021  This was more than a year ago    today bitcoin has just crashed face it ur just  another Kung Fu con man   probably a spy for China,3,1
You are acting like Bitcoin has never crashed before  Relax ,1,

Haha really going to 35000  just opposite to what u said  bad timing bro,6,1
The way you described the ending where bitcoin is acting like a consolidation for the rest of the coins makes me think in a way bitcoin is an index fund tracking the entire crypto space  Hmm ,2,0

Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life  life was hard for me until I started Bitcoin and I m now earning  9 500 per week ,3,1
It s truly amazing that a government allows people to fabricate currency out of thin air  What could go wrong  Cryptocurrency isn t backed by anything  or anyone  It isn t a proxy for ownership of another asset  like a share of stock  I understand the technology  but allowing private individuals to fabricate currency or securities that don t represent anything at all is foolhardy  It s pure speculation   Crypto is not stocks  bonds  gold  silver or even diamonds   It s value is based on pure speculation   Stocks are driven higher based on fundamentals more than speculation  but stocks do have fundamental underlying value   Crypto has zero underlying value except what someone else thinks it has  but if you had to liquidate crypto what would you end up with ,3,1
Only thing bitcoin needed to start dropping was for tech lead to jump on board and start pumping it  Lol,1,0
I m actually tired of working about stocks   it s driving me nuts these days  I think crypto investment is far better than stock  ,4,2
you mean 10k or 100k  looks like it will be 10k soon   ,1,0
I want to point out that your idea of consolidation might be correct but don t forget that the dollar size of crypto market is growing as well  I see the market grow as more and more regulations for institutional investors are coming in future   Another factor for market growth is a increasing crypto awareness among regular people    So there may be consolidation at some point in future but for the next few years I see people and institutions throwing money at crypto without looking deep as you do ,1,0

Hi love your content can you make a video on shiba token what are your thoughts I see it a lot but not sure thanks keep making videos I ll keep watching,1,0
Question what stops bitcoin from going to zero and it consolidating into something else,2,0
cypto have no use in real world   no government accepted it   you can not exchange much of any commodities with it     the only reason why it rise its rest on who the next guy willing to catch the falling knife      if market is all cherry ok    if market tank    it will go along with it  ,1,0
I think consolidation in BTC is expected but we all play with time here  How long has it take for FB to consolidate  A decade  I think it is not wise to put wealth on gold and only gold since you ll lose opportunity cost on oil and metal and other commodities  I don t agree with people put money into BTC and ETH only neither  It s not a good enough of a risk management to me  To ignore BTC  however  is also unwise ,3,1
Hi  Techlead  I just want to ask  what is your  say  or opinion about the  Monero   this coin is the only one being promoted by Jeff Berwick  I had high respect and trust to Jeff  he is one of the earliest adapter of  Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency  Economy  as a whole  I want another knowledgeable and a trusted person and opinion who can give me a sound information about this coin  And I want to ask also about the Blockchain Technology  Hedera Hasgraph had a blockchain that has it s own architecture different from the blockchains of Bitcoin and Ether Ethereum  what is your opinion and commentary on these different kinds of blockchains  ,1,0

 clark  Entry is everything  ,3,
I have been trading for about 6 months now and just about every trade backfires and slaps me in my face  Nearly impossible for me to catch more than a few points    I try to do top down analysis but it doesn t work for me   I say to myself  clearly I m in the 90  that lose money  so I open a demo account  do my analysis  then take the opposite of what I would normally take and get the same result  I m starting to feel hopeless  any advice for a struggling trader ,46,12
Get out while you can ,1,
If you are new to trading perhaps to not trade in crypto  These are always high risk highly volatile trades in a market plagued with insider trading and plain old scams  Really learn investing by learning about the industry you are investing in  read financial newspapers to get to know the companies and understand what they are doing  Treat it like hobby  Once you understand the market you are about to invest in you can start to predict what is going to happen  Turn a guess in to an educated guess if you like    If you just buy random crypto by gambling on them going up you have a better chance of just going to a casino and put everything on red  at least then you have a  almost  50  chance to double your money ,2,
 Amir betts You re correct  I don t lose money every single trade  but my main problem is trying to let my runners run  Very rarely do I catch big moves   Instead they go a few pips in my direction  then go against me if when I try holding them  Also my entries could use a lot of improvement  A mentor would be amazing  but getting one is easier said than done  If it s not too much to ask  do you know any legit ones ,1,
 Elizabeth Armstrong Don t listen to her  don t give up  Trading takes time months  even years  to master  even the pros learn everyday  Never the less  if you lose money no matter which side you take  maybe you need to look at how you are managing active trades rather than how you are entering them  My advice  find a mentor   And also  try incorporating the use of oscillators  Bollinger and pivot points into your strategy  And most importantly move to higher TFs 4h or 1D preferably   you ll thank me later  ,2,
Your problem could be your stop loss is too close or you re watching your trades too much  Place it and walk away  Or you could just give up  trading isn t for everyone ,3,
 once everyone starts talking about a specific stock and it s all over the news   the best time to have already invested in that company has already passed  avoid hype  you don t want to be paying more for stock than what it s worth  ,92,5

Great video as always   The problem with Bitcoin is that now it is just traded like a commodity     the difference is that commodities are supposed to actually have something physical behind them   Bitcoin does not  It also seems to just mirror the tech market index these days   However  there is a chance that it will be valued at 100 000 USD if hyper inflation kicks in   Prob won t be this year though ,3,1

Really compelling argument  I ve been feeling for the last few months that I should reallocate back towards bitcoin  I had gone more into ethereum this summer since it had dropped to 1700 and that s where my main entry point is  But thinking about why I even invest and my personal time horizon  bitcoin does seem better for my purposes,16,4

And this is coming from you    The same dude that made a video how BTC will go to 0 for sure,1,0
You re the guy saying bitcoin is going to zero  aren t you ,2,1
don t be fools guys    bitcoin are going to 10k  in this year with snp500 markets down to 2500 level  and even lower     my target for 2022 is about 6k  ,1,1

I need more bitcoin,1,0
LOL,1,0
Pretty good analysis ,2,0
So you are reiterating why Bitcoin is great  but this has all been true for years now  How is this thing going to cause that precise price estimation precisely in 2022  Other than hope and 100 000 being a nice rounded number and 2022 being the present year,1,1

I don t really agree with the conclusions you make  You but do make some interesting points for sure  BTC seems to be on a continuous down trend against the rest of the market  Now a lot of those projects will disappear but I don t see BTC ever recapturing the   dominance that it once had ,1,0
Lmao  bitcoin is dead  and now it s King     Welcome back to the Bitcoin side  ,1,0
I came across your channel while I m driving listening to news about crypto in general  I really want to thank you for sharing your thoughts about bitcoin and it made me realize stuff  I need to rethink my portfolio and prioritize soon  Thanks again,2,2
hey techlead  as a millionaire  why do you not have better control over your emotions  more friends  more happiness  and more joy in your life ,1,1
Don t forget the true decentralised cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is  proof of work  rather then  proof of stake  as with the majority of the other coin s   ,1,1
Used to love watching your channel until you pretended to be an expert on Crypto  You know nothing  as a millionaire  ,1,2

Hey Patrick  I hope you and your family are doing well  You really helped shift my mentality  I ve always been labeled as an  introvert   when in reality the times I ve drifted away from a friendship and focused on my goals  we re the t times I ve made the most personal progress  I like the way you bring up real conflicting questions that a person should be asking himself  I wish I could collaborate with someone like you on trending topics  or grab a coffee and talk business ,7,4
I began buying VIAC   T   BBY and T for 2022  I picked up T at 22 40 average   BBY average is 99 40  VIAC average is 30 55  I have most of my capital in cash at this point  I m up 78  so far on the year due to a good trade in BPT which got me up 60  in week and I m out and clear on those gains   So 2022 is starting off a good year  MELI is another I have a good position in   I began buying at 33k and I have acquired 20 shares at a 33 400 average  I was able to raise over 18 BTC  in November from implementing trades with signals and insights from Daniel Peter I would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about ,51,4

I don t know the exact amount but my weekly profit ranges from  25 000 You know it depends on the amount you invested and coin price fluctuations in the market ,1,
Great  Personally I love proving people wrong  Friend investing in bitcoin for me has not been impressing  how much do you make of it  if you don t mind me asking ,4,
Well I m not surprised seeing this cause I m a huge beneficiary of this woman s top notch tactics and skills ,1,
I met Rose Robert last year for the first time at a conference in BELGIUMI  linvested  30 000 and traded in one month  making close to  200 000 ,1,

Make a note to Rose Robert regarding your interest in investing in Bitcoin ,2,
My first investment with ROSE ROBERT  gave me a profit of 80k dolars and ever since then she has never failed to deliver and I still stand by saying she is the most sincere broker I have know,1,
Wow   Impressive you trade with Rose Robert too  I thought people don t know her that well     She s really awesome ,1,
 Just bought  7K Ethereum and  14k bitcoin with the recent dump in crypto I was told it s the right time to buy and get ready for a skyrocket ,2,
How does this whole bitcoin thing works  I m interested in it and willing and ready to invest heavily but I need an assistant to properly guide me through on how to make a good startup and be successful in it without making mistakes ,1,
Crypto trading is very profitable when you trade well ,2,
Exactly  at the moment bitcoin is the best and profitable coin to buy and invest in ,4,

Everyone said during all of 2021 the BTC would reach  100K by the end of the year    now it s at  47  49  down from  70K  So I agree it is digital gold  and I agree it is highly volatile with an upward trend LONG TERM but you need the stomach to tolerate that much volatility or you will get wiped out   So if you can stomach the trend NOW it s the time to BUY more  so mortgage your home and go for it  make the payments on that loan and wait for mid year   ,5,3
BTC does nothing  smart contract platform coins are used to pay for transaction fees on the chain,1,0

I agree tech  You re on to something  This market will consolidate eventually ,3,1
Very interesting perspective  It s always good to get a techies point of view on the crypto space ,2,0
I agree with your statement on the metaverse  especially the virtual reality side of it   No one wants that  at least not anytime soon   However I do see play to earn and NFT gaming here to stay   I think people are still super bullish on those as well as various altcoins this year  but once things get hot again It s probably a good idea to trade these in for BTC,3,1
Million token will never be the biggest token,1,0
You was just bashing bitcoin for million token a few months ago lol,1,0
You know it s serious when tech lead makes no sarcastic jokes ,1,0
What you re not mentioning is the network effect that bitcoin and now also ethereum has  The ethereum network transacted 6 trillion usd during 2020  bitcoin  only  about a trillion usd  What s more  ethereum handles 1 2 million transactions per day  bitcoin  merely  260 000  Bitcoin has a long term viable  use case  however ethereum certainly does too  This is why ethereum is the proverbial oil to bitcoin s gold  50 50 split seems like a pretty dang good idea ,14,2
I dont think so  All  predictions  are pretty much a toss coin  Too volatile for much investment taste  I ll rather go old school and buy blue chips ,1,0
Normal people buy in at high prices the stock market goes down  companies buy stocks back cheaper by introducing some disaster Stock rises after a disaster and the cycle repeats  Having a good entry and exit strategy  will make you succeed in the stock market ,2,2

t s coming back up 20zz    history  but comparing Btc to 2013  2017 it s like comparing the 1800 s to 2000 s  It kinda sounds good but it s apple s to orange s  I have been holding since 2018 and I am hoping just like everyone else that it will assess before 2022  but some believe while others don t  Too many instuititations waiting for new budget allocations  Suppress the market for the real money to come in  ergo the lengthening of the cycle    I wish I had bought more  I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience to do exactly what you have said in this post  I have learned from you and other s especially From David Mayor  who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 6 to 15btc that no one really knows what is going to happen and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past  It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research,5,14

Ethereum s worthless  but you re now a BTC maxi  I don t get it ,1,1
Dismissing Ethereum by saying it ll be replaced by a network like Polygon misses the obvious in that Polygon doesn t exist without Ethereum   Also  it s hard to take you seriously when you shill milliontoken with a  14m market cap at the same time saying that the smaller coins will all go to  0 and consolidate in the bigger coins   14m market cap doesn t even come close to the top and only puts it just inside the top 1000 coins ,1,1

BTC is a fad and it makes no sense long term   This will not last  It s illogical ,1,1
This was good,1,0
 love the grounded reality of this channel   TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC  More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market I have made over 8 5btc from day tradng with Micheal Richard  insights and signals in less than 2 weeks  his is one of the best medium    to backup your assets incase it goes bearish ,55,4
Men You like Flexing lol remember We are all millionaire,2,1

I don t understand how anyone could question where crypto and block chain technology is going  If you hold fiat your losing money every minute  if you hold solid alts or bitcoin your making money  That simple   not trading for short term  but investing long term  You cannot lose,1,1
I m sorry but if BTC is going to 100k  which it is  then ETH will surpass bitcoin s market cap eventually and have better return on investment  ETH to 10 12k easily in 2022 ,2,1
Your thesis has flipped since 7 months ago  when btc was going to zero according to you   Key difference in network layer is staking rewards and transaction fees vs the internet rails so  people will need and hold eth sol whatever it s not a race to the bottom yet  it a race to adoption,3,1

Bitcoin bull run   expected to take off again in 2022  and overlap with the run up to next years Litecoin reward halving    Previous run ups had a huge effect   ,4,13
First mover advantage and network effect    It would be difficult   though not impossible  to replace Amazon or Apple for example    Because Bitcoin is decentralised around the world the difficulty is compounded ,1,
Because it s decentralised around the world  and has no central authority it s much more difficult to control censor or confiscate ,1,
Nothing wrong with Gold  But as for Bitcoin it s already wiidely established  decentralised and its value will be decided by the usefulness of the system    Already legal tender in El Salvador and used for remittances and or payments in Cuba Venezuela and several US states and numerous businesses etc   Will see what happens  Thanks for your feedback  Regards ,1,
  per cent uptime  zero downtime over 10 years and a new Smart Contract and NFT platform just released  3rd most used crypto for payment  purchase transactions after Bitcoin and Eth    Adoption by numerous banks and processors around the world and the world s top two movie chains    Upcoming fungibility  update for Litecoin could be a game changer  Too much more to mention ,1,
The security of the system  decentralisation  scarcity of  coins  and usefulness as a means of value transfer  payment  and store of value  underpins the demand for value of Bitcoins around which the  price speculation  occurs  ,1,
Hmm    interesting perspective I must say  Would love to revisit this video after 10 years,3,0

honestly  this is a sincere question  why would you care about investing in something that can at best  5 10 15x returns in like  10 years  with the amount of money you invested in bitcoin  how much will you make if bitcoin goes to 500 000  ,1,0
Great video  And thank you for sharing your thoughts   I think Bitcoin will gain in value because the eco system within other token projects will succeed and grow their ecosystems  enhance their level of sophistication  and convert the worlds currency to be fully digitized    Real world assets will have digitized world counterparts  and fully digitized assets will have its own value agreed upon by the people participating within its ecosystem  commonly referred to as DAOs    Bitcoins  rise in value will not be due to consolidation  But  through multi coin adoption ,10,1
It took me a long time  but I m a btc maximalist at this point  It s the only crypto that I know won t crash to zero  Everything else is garbage in my opinion ,20,4
The altcoins have always out performed it as an investment ,2,
ETH won t crash,3,
You are wrong ,1,
That s    Interesting ,1,

Crypto is a commodity  like gold or beanie babies  not a currency or money  It s easy to think that currency gets it s value from it s supplier  but unless there is a drain on that currency  you just have another commodity  The drain for the US dollar is US federal taxes  The supplier of US dollars is the US federal government  So  they print and then collect the dollars they create  They can give everyone stimmy checks  or institute a new tax  They completely control the US dollar economy  whether they realize it or not  This is how all currency has worked since forever  The gold standard wasn t around as long as people pretend it was  Rulers of the past used to change the value of gold whenever they wanted  Basing your economy around the supply of a commodity is silly  Stimmy checks might have angered some  but it showed that at least there is some give to the system  Once everyone understands how currency gets it s value  they might do a better job electing people to run the economy  The people in charge of the supply and drain of the currency you re required to pay your taxes in  it one way or another  have control over you  They decide whether you re rich or you re poor  They decide who gets new money and who loses the money they already have  This will always be true  Until Bitcoin can pay taxes  it s a commodity  and only a foolish ruler would allow taxes to be paid in a currency  they can t control ,1,0

 every  1 you invest today is a little bit of time that you buy back in the future  the more you invest  the more free time you can afford  in the future  having time and the freedom to choose what to do are the ultimate investing  goals  ,5,4

I m an equities precious metals guy  but I ve always said that once bitcoin loses steam at the end of this multi year rally  I ll pick some up  But honestly the sole purpose in all of this is finding investment vehicles to lower your wealth entropy  over time,13,4
You should add now  because if you look at bitcoins history chart it jumps from 6K   60K then from 60K back to 30K and jumped to 70K then back to high 30s low 40K  right now   I doubt it would just drop down below 30K  I guarantee the price point you re waiting for  losing steam  is not going to happen because the lower it goes the more people will buy back in  If anything it s likely Bitcoin hits 80 85K drops back to high 40s low 50K  Then returns to 100K after that ,3,
By the time it loses steam it ll be in the six figure range  If you were interested you should ve bought some when it was lower to begin with,6,

Glad you have moved to Bitcoin  When I heard your video about crypto going to zero I thought this guy needs to listen to the Saylor Series about what money is and the role of Bitcoin   I think you are right about the consolidation  With Ethereum I think it might be the  Microsoft Windows  of Web3  The layer  Operation System where applications are being built upon  And Microsoft still exists today right  Maybe the value of that operating system is going to be greater than Bitcoin  As Bitcoin is only the monetary layer orvthe store of wealth layer  I mean the property layer   So I m bettting on the top two  Bitcoin as digital gold and store of wealth  or a savings account  And Ethereum as the Windows platform where all the applications are being built on ,4,2
The market is gonna follow the early 2021 rally  just a guess  Not a fan of rise and fall anymore  people think Investing in crypto is all about buying coin and leaving it to rise      common it takes much analysis to be a successful crypto trader  i trade with Edward James  his skills set is exceptional  A portfolio I got into the strategy with 1 3BTC is growing to 6 6Btc    ,45,6

The  store of value  use case    will likely consolidate into BTC  Other coins tokens will stay around proportional to the utility value that they deliver   similar to the stock market where there s thousands of stocks out there  though  within this space  there will be  blue chip  and non blue chip assets   the lion s share of the market cap will go to the blue chips  But this doesn t mean that all mid caps and small caps will evaporate ,41,4

I think bitcoin is a safe bet and won t be surprised if it doubles this year   But i also think that other  tech  tokens are also competing with bitcoin from an investment point of view  I completely agree that there will be consolidation happening between the blockchains with more value being locked up in these dominant chains  In this case bitcoin is also part of that competition  people that have their money bitcoin may decide to move it to these consolidated chains in order profit from that growth  So even though bitcoin is not a  tech  token  it is still competing financially with the other chain and could lose its value too ,4,0

Totally agree with you on Etherium 2 0 but I m not sure about BTC  Why should BTC remain The King if there are other potential stores of value that offer newer  cleaner tech  less fees  faster service  etc  Bitcoin is like Blockbuster  You think it will be around forever because it s a household name and  too big to fail   And then suddenly it does fail and the next generation of products seize the throne  The entire world saves money by switching from bitcoin to a better coin project  The people who get screwed are the retail investors ,1,0

Comparing Bitcoin to gold is kinda stupid  Gold you can not create it in your home  Bitcoin you can as many time as you want maybe you can make more scarce Bitcoin by changing 21M to 1M like your million token which has no value other than you and your follower believe it has value  Value of Bitcoin is coming from the believe of people like you  as a millionaire   and Bitcoin maxis who work hard to bringing people in  And from miners who make profit by not allowing Bitcoin to scale ,1,0

I agree  though to be honest  I need a cheat sheet or signal to tell the diff  I m on the spectrum and have a really hard time telling when he s serious or trolling    Like all good trolling  and advice for that matter   I deeply suspect that s the entire point  However  it makes me super leery to trust anything because I don t want to get burned   As for me  I m going with ETH BTC split even though I am bullish on ETH for exactly the reasons he outlined  There will be consolidation  It s going to be a bumpy ride regardless  especially once BTC threatens fiat and  the controllers   BTC will NEED some of the other coins and they will all need BTC to make it through  The elephant in the room  in my humble opinion  is going to be decentralized  democratized  leadership that is somehow immune to dis misinformation ,1,
Hey any advice   I m new to this put 300  dollars on bitcoin and so far is going up by the dollar   been doing my research and it seems like I right a good choice by investing   should I put more   Or should I just call it  ,3,2
anyone who is an avid coin collector is cringing so hard when he dropped those coins together and rubbed them in his hands  ouch  and to those who don t know  you don t need to drill your coins  you can use a machine to test them  everyone in the coin community knows what a sigma machine is  gold and silver will always have a value its good to diversify ,1,0
My concern with bitcoin is mostly the high fees  Even to send it to a different wallet there are fees  Everybody buys it and owns it but does it actually have any legitimate use other than people just hoarding it because of the value going up ,3,4

Won t touch bitcoin  Even if it did become digital gold  so many other projects are upcoming with different use cases that I d want to be a part of that growth way more than the 2x that Bitcoin may do  And frankly  any Financial sector focused token is not on my books  The Gaming and Metaverse plays have a easier and faster path to wide adoption and I m involved in it now  not 10 years from now ,10,11
 DEJ yeah  i know you havnt  Which is why you need to research more about what bitcoin actually is  and what it isnt   A valid strategy i suppose but   why wouldnt you buy now when the price is as it is   then you win with the olds and the new gold ,1,

     I respect the work you put in your videos  I find it truly baffling that all major crypto you tubers just look at pure wave and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems  It s sort of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC  We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps  narrowly avoiding a long term bear market  this is the worst possible time in history to hodl as so many don t back up their crypto assets  more emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  i have made over 9 btc with 2 7 btc from day trading with Daniel s help in few weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish You can reach Daniel on  eI    m Danielwrightfx ,1,0

you ve just described every crypto influencer I can think of  The  experts  are just as clueless as everyone about where things are going ,1,
How can someone have a consistent opinion on Bitcoin if Bitcoin itself is not consistent ,2,
Maybe his opinion changes frequently  Mine often does as well  The more I learn the more that knowledge shapes my opinions  Having consistent opinions is probably a sign of a closed minded individual,7,
He probably loaded up on BTC so now he wants to pump it,4,
The Internet networking layer never had a coin behind it that could hold the value by people purchasing and holding it  while I agree with you in most regards that s one portion of why you were wrong about the value of the networking layer,3,4

Excellent,1,1
You just proved your not just a coder but a technologist ,4,2
After 10years there are BTC  but the rest of the coins could be dead  It s impossible to name any other coin that will be there after time will pass  Maybe one or two technology will survive like  Eth  Avalanche  Solana  Ada   but we don t know yet which one got developed best and got mass adopted  It s too early  At the moment there are so many shitty altcoins and most of them will die when time goes on  in short term  you can make or lose money with alts while peoples try to figure out which ones are working  but this ongoing  test phase  won t last forever  It always goes that way with new technology   trial and error  but only the strongest ones will survive  BTC is fundamentally different than other coins  it s hard to think that BTC suddenly disappear  but it s not that hard to imagine if some other big coins die because of poor leadership  wrong decisions  coding errors  etc   trust can be lost fast because we re talking about new valuable assets ,1,1

Bitcoin to gold isnt a great analogy  its actually better than gold by far  Think about it  you can make more gold  yes i said make  through modern alchemy scientists have figured out a way to make gold  And you can mine for gold  Well once bitcoin hits 21 million mined its done  Thats it  There will never be more than 21 million of it  And technically its worth more even still as people lose it  Lose access to it or just forget a password  your bitcoin goes up in value  Its way better than gold ,2,1

If people s investments in coins not called Bitcoin went to zero there wouldn t be anything to consolidate into BTC unless you think that after going to zero these investors would now pour more money into BTC  I find it hard to believe that if someone had a mutual fund that went to zero they would then invest new money into a single stock  I think they would no longer invest in any stocks  Just my guess  People severely burned tend to not like fire ,10,1

A lot would change if exchanges listed Satoshis instead of Bitcoin  It would seem a lot cheaper and affordable ,5,3
Vechain is a solid investment,1,1
TechLead  we love you  ,2,1
BTC going to Zero and BTC going to 100 000 USD are recommended just next to each other ,3,1
Barbaric metal hahaha,1,1
bitcoin is unlimited supply  they just fractionalize it rather than making a rule you have to buy a whole one   so unlimited,1,1
Love your videos and your progmatism   is that a word  LOL   Something I am curious about though is I see a LOT of videos on Crypto going back 4 and 5 years   Are we still really on the cutting edge of this stuff ,7,6
Yes  traditional finance is rather time consuming to disrupt ,1,

Make 100 bucks when bitcoin Hits a million cause u cant afford even half a Bitcoin or make 10 mil out of a 100 bucks with some altcoin lotterY picks,1,1
Mm holder,1,1
Better wait for the 85  Bitcoin dip,1,1
I love how you are smart  If you made a yield aggregator project like YIELD  SPOOL or FORM   which would find best possible yields across whole defi  I would immediately buy your coin  It would have best possible defi strategies  bcs you are smartest   So I think that would be much better project that Million token  which isnt that attractive investment  I think yield aggregator projects are the future and if you make one  i believe it could hit top 20 and become one of those long term consolidation projects ,2,0
Australia is consolidating around coal and cane toads,1,1
Awesome vid ,2,2
 That guy again ,1,1
buy 0 28 Bitcoin and you are the top 1  of all people in the world,1,1
consolidation  oh for sure  crypto reminds me of 1995 tech boom  choose wisely for it s software   and that software needs a market that will use the technology,2,2
if u have enough bitcoin  u can get a loan and the intrest rate to pay it back is cheap,1,1
Why do you have so many spammers in the comment section ,4,1
You contradict yourself too much,2,1
I dont like bitcoin tbh as i still think its just specuilation to extract even more money from ordinary people by rich ones  There is no real value in it  no work or real product in there  That bitcoin can be worth 1 cent tomorrow and i would not be surprised   Anyways  i miss your emitionless ironic content  that was awesome    Cheers mate ,1,6
yikes mate  you may be right     but your attitude about it leads me to believe you don t doc dive on what the tech is and why it does have value in its network ,1,
That s because you haven t studied it enough  No worries  you ll buy it at the price you deserve ,1,
It doesn t come out of nowhere  It takes energy to make crypto,1,
I like it when he says  quick pause ,2,0
So true  Been short on ETH since 4200  I did hedge yesterday 30 percent of my portfolio  What s the point  Bonds will do well soon  not this crap ,1,0
Michael Saylor would be proud,4,1
I think one of the big reasons why people look to alternatives to bitcoin is it s scaling problem  Or do you think any of its lay or two solutions have really solved that for the long term ,1,2
The internet protocol stack is built on layers  and so will bitcoin  Deal with it   ,2,
Lightening has solved this  instantly transfer BTC anywhere in the world for 1 Satoshi  But scaling isn t an issue if we don t use BTC as a unit of exchange  it s matured past this  more are seeing it as a simple store of value  The simplicity of BTC is what makes it soooo strong ,3,

I know for sure BitCoin is going to  100K    and that s becaue I m not going to buy  If I buy  then it s guaranteed to go back to  10K,47,18
It will never reach 10k to many people would buy it up before it got that low ,1,
Bitcoin will dip into the 30s this year,1,
Bogdandoff   he bought  Damp it ,2,
I am with you  Anything I touch  they will go down like a rock  100  accurate ,1,
Hahaha I agree  I always advise people there is only one guarantee when buying any crypto or shares  as soon as you hit the buy button the price will go down  Once you get comfortable with that it s easy to take the short term pain for the longer term upside ,5,
Layer 1 s like Edgeware that are built on top of modular frameworks will quickly begin to outpace last gen blockchain technology such as Bitcoin ,1,1
