Here s my related video on being an INTJ from my second channel  https   www youtube com watch v iKslmHfYYy8 but let me know  do you think I am more INTJ or INTP ,54,49
 N A I think he is ESTJ  INTJ can act like a lawyer and detective at the same time where they like search and argue at a person s weakness  INTP can act like lecturer and children at the same time where they like to talk and talk according to their logic but dislike criticism ,1,
As fellow INTJ,1,
As an INTP who worked with lots of INTJs  my 5 cents   You delivering things indicates INTJ  but might just be upbringing  being millionere  or ex Google FB thing  Your monologue seems to be INTP like   explaining yourself  reasons  INTJs tend to go to the point with confident concise wording  INTJ messages tend to be more simple        and thats all there is to it   If youre INTJ  then youre the softest one I seen  in a good way  ,2,
definitely INTJ,1,
INTP thinks people are stupid  INTJ thinks people can be stupid ,1,
Having used MBTI as a useful too for years  I describe myself as an INTP who values The strengths of INTJs  Having watched many of your videos  you strike me as a clear INTJ who is well rounded and appreciates strengths of INTPs ,2,
 watchvids100 ok  do you know about the cognitive functions  My point was simply that INTPs are stubborn only when they are immature  and INTJs can be stubborn too for the same reason  but each type will be stubborn about different things  INTPs won t listen to other people s reasons  because reason and truth are their responsibility  while INTJs won t listen to what other people want or won t budge when their point of view is challenged  because they feel responsible to define how things around them must be  according to their vision and mostly for themselves   but will nevertheless listen to reason because they see reasoning and reaching truth as something to be done with others  Anyway this just applies in immature people,1,
Absolutely an INTJ  Ni user is all about visualizing what themselves want to do  Te Fi is making decision that is good for themself  being rational  focusing on other people different perspectives and make conclusion based of that  intj doesn t believe there is an absolute truth while a ti user like intp actually think there is an absolute truth  their Fi however belief there is an absolute good,1,
As an INTP I can confirm that you re definitely an INTJ  The big difference is being plan oriented vs being theory oriented  Also  check out cognitive functions theory if you d like to go deeper ,2,
INTJ vibes  but knowing a person from the videos    and also remembering it s all a meme anyway   ,1,
If you didn t sell your cryptos bitcoin  you might save ur marriage  your kid    still working in a big tech company  instead of frustrated   proclaiming urself as a millionaire ,1,
I think you are more of an INTJ,2,
I test very strongly for INTJ  You are an INTJ  Yes  you are articulate  Yes  you consider other opinions  But that does not make you an INTP like some of the comments are saying  Notice the way I write  I am definitive in my thoughts  but I also know that I could be wrong  I am always happy to hear other people s opinion on why I am wrong  in fact I actively seek trusted people s opinion  and I will change my mind if they have convinced me I am wrong  I am  and you are  an open minded INTJ ,3,
5 28  I will let you fail   Lol  no empathy  assistance  or care for another human being ,1,
You re more INTP   You ve mentioned to rely less on experts and to  think for ourselves  Which tells me you value introverted thinking  generate self reasons through logical thinking  way more than extroverted thinking  wanting to cite expert sources  caring more about group reasons so that it can be accepted by all   Also  you are funny as hell  dry  sarcastic Ne jokes   INFP Edit  also I agree with Jen 33  The Ne in INTP makes them verbose because they can effortlessly generate ideas to discuss about  it s never ending  The INTJ is driven by efficiency and will make their point across in a few minutes and end the video ,8,
Don t fall into INTP territory  There is an objective Truth you should tell others about  Deus Vult ,2,
 Bimbambu tV Yep  got a whole book on it ,1,
Definitely INTJ  you are using Fi a lot  and of course Ni and Te  and exercise Ti but for the sake of Ni and Te ,4,
 Kobi 42 do you know about the 8 cognitive functions  ,2,
if youre asking that question you are probably an intj     intj wants to make judgments make sense of the world   and try to form conclusions of what an objective reality looks like waht is reality and what is not ,3,
Hi Techlead  The problem with INTJ and INTP types are that they are both introverted types and this gives problems with the order of the perceiving versus judging functions  compared with the extrovert types  This may confuse you  but believe me  this detailed analysis goes beyond the level of any meaningfull discussion of what these types encompasses  The problem with MBTI is that it is a non scientific typelogy propagated by a commercial company  It is dependent on selfdesignation and therefore immune to double blind tests  I had the  un fortunate experience of consulting a certified MBTI tester  and I can tell you she wasn t aware of this issue  so why bother ,7,
INTJ for sure,6,
You are definitely INTJ because I ve never seen you go to Burning Man despite you being a successful Tech Lead in Silicon Valley XD,10,

The reliability of a research paper s conclusions doesn t stem from the credentials of the researchers  it stems from the methods and procedures an understanding of the methods and procedures used to conduct the experiment  which are documented in detail within the actual research paper  TechLead says it himself   maybe 80  of research papers cannot be reproduced anyways   In other words  research papers that build upon and reference past experiments are all the more reliable  Research papers that have accumulated large bodies of evidence in support of their conclusions have  earned  their credibility  Anyone can find a few one off papers supporting some ridiculous claims  but knowledge from research papers is gained by assessing a particular body of research   as a whole   and identifying patterns that provide new insights ,2,0

I ve observed people tell themselves that they don t like making decisions so they just won t make any  The thing is  the decision to not make a decision IS a decision  So we better make decisions we can happily live with rather than live in avoidance  I love the suggestions in this video ,14,0
I think you re INTP  you value logic and critical thinking to create your own framework for things vs  trusting expert sources   Ti vs  Te   You seem to have Fe inferior  bad with emotionally understanding people  not influenced by mainstream values   and you seem to be driven by your curiousity  multiple projects jobs  rather than a definite view of your future  Ne vs  Ni ,7,0

I find it more like coming home to a woman that rambles   and after she is done talking you tell her   get me a beer  ,6,
Btw techlead  intj is actually more of an intp because their dominant function is a perception function Ni  while it s also can be applied to intp because Ti judging function   my argument is just how they should be labeled the dichotomy letters  and has nothing to do with their personality  one more thing don t just read from website like at 4 59   it s actually so vague what do you mean by complex problem  Does it require more rational thought or logical thought  To be honest the only way to solve complex problem is if you actually have both Ti Te to solve the actual problem as problem is never static   mbti is just a test not the actual science,1,0

I think you are INTJ  because you seem like someone with Ni as his primary function then someone with Ti as his primary function   Also the J P for introverted types is wrong ,1,0

Hey techlead  even though I ended up just shy on the INFJ side  I still sometimes lean towards being INTJ probably due to my family heritage  I do similar gathering of data points that lean towards a certain direction  but I have to wait and internalize that and try to pass it through the filters which are my priorities or morals  For example  I just left a very stable job to get into the tech industry with a startup  and while the money was substantially better  I tried to balance out the other pros and cons such as extra work hours occasionally and less benefits and stability   I tried to pass my ideas through as many trusted people as possible before I brought the details to my family  which were one of my top priorities  aside from my own sanity and need for challenge  to see what they thought about it based on my pre filtered and hopefully relatively balanced data ,3,0

Have to say through this channel  I recently learned that there s a whole thingy majigger about INTJ and other personality types    I think that a person is a product of evironment and up bringing  culture  events that mold you along the way  as well as innate personality   I started looking into it  not sure what I am   Interesting though ,2,0
Ha  I can switch between INTJ and INTP depending on what context I am in  but my baseline usually gravitated towards INTP   this is much wiser  My top values are joy  progression of joy  and freedom of choice ,3,2
Hey  I test half way between INTJ and INTP every time     agreed  I think that s why he switched to INTP now as well  even tho clearly his baseline at least has been INTJ  My values  supposedly   boil down to contentment  Consider all sides of a problem or situation  and find a win win ,1,
You are answering my question   Gracias ,1,0

My god what is this trolling  Tech lead is an exemplary ENTJ  INTJ P are never into entrepreneurship and rarely discard pure joy of creating analyzing stuff for money  I have an ENTJ friend and his has very similar world view to Tech lead  Money efficiency  more process based than system thinking  And he also is dead sure that he is introverted  People who need an urge to talk for hours with youtube viewers family etc are not introverted lol xD It is much easier to see what type you are looking at your weakest sides  For INTJ   weak control over willpower pushing from or to this person  cannot work under pressure For INTP   emotions  very depressed people by nature  cannot be optimistic For ENTJ   bad control over their body  health  weak feeling of being tired or rested etc Judging by your weaknesses you can better understand where on the spectrum of this classification you are ,2,0

 Fabien R I think you may be getting defensive   ,1,
 Fabien R actually infp do know what s good for them as the  perceiver  because they made decision based what is good or bad for them through Fi Te  it s called being rationale   they should make plans Te  for others to make their business succeed for their own benefit Fi   but because the Fi is more balance with it s shadow it also consider the benefits for other people Fe  because they can be susceptable to feel guilty if they don t do that compare to an entj or estj   it s the same as entj with Te Fi   that s  one example of how it usually goes with infp  don t type through dichotomies letter  ,1,

It s been a toss up between INFJ and INTJ for me  I m definitely a heavy Ti user  so I guess INFJ is it  As far as personality goes  I do tend to put others first at my own detriment  It has hindered my path to being in a much better place in life  but I know it s my own doing  Personality tests are great for helping people understand themselves in my opinion  Just try not to allow yourself to be boxed in by the results and use  that s just the way I am  as a reason not to grow ,2,6

It was very subtle to subliminally associate vaccine sceptics with flat earthers  Doing that  is using a logical fallacy called guilt by association  I like Techlead  but that was a pretty underhanded comment to make    Multinational vaccine makers are for profit stock market companies  It is not like they are some benevolent fairy tale pixie dust dispensing angels from heaven  These companies and their products should not be beyond criticism and scrutiny  just like anything else  It s really that simple ,1,

Tsubasa Hanekawa once said   I don t know everything  I just know what I know    For me  I think it is in the nature of things to feel uncertain about things that are uncertain    For instance  if a person were to know something  he can say   I know   If a person were to not know something  he can say   I don t know   It wouldn t be proper to say   I know  when in fact one does NOT know  wouldn t it  Conversely  it wouldn t be proper to say   I don t know  when in fact one knows   What are some things one knows  For starters  when one is seeing  one knows one is seeing  When hearing  one knows one is hearing  When hearing    tasting    touching    smelling   thinking    etc  etc   When one engages with concepts  knowing their tenuous  fragile nature  one is aware of such and apprehends such  Knowing the dis satisfactory nature of such phenomena  one is not involved    Anyways  those are my thoughts  as an INTP  not a millionaire ,1,0
This is interesting for me as an INTJ  I do think he is an INTJ as well  We are high conviction people  but we don t necessarily force our views on others  More prone to attempt to convince others when called upon  rather than push own views uninvited like some other types do ,4,2

As a previously incorrectly typed INTJ who is actually an INTP   There is a greater difference between INTJ and INTP than the last J P alone  Go down the rabbit hole a bit further gathering that knowledge  then apply it to your self and others for analysis     That way you have the full framework of understanding to measure it against  for the sake of accuracy  ,1,0

everyone who drinks alcohol and or pespi coca cola fanta  basically most people  most plebs and even some wine gulping aristocratic snobs as well,1,
I think in psychology  values  called as dominants   for example in some cults followers believe that wealth is evil  Basically it s a sin to be rich  and if you rich you are going to hell  And with such dominant people doomed to be poor because they will avoid any path that can make them to wealth such as getting good education  taking better opportunities and so on  Another classical example   people who believe that Earth is flat  There is no way to convince them in opposite if this knowledge is dominant  And this dominant leads for a certain pretty logical conclusions   for example that government is hiding truth  otherwise how to explain everything else   such people making pretty logical decisions and having this dominant will come to conclusion that zog exists and everyone is fooled by it or work to this hidden government   pretty sad setup  What I want to say is that these values or dominants are pretty hard to identify  even though it s possible  because they are set in childhood  but this set of values will define your whole life   it s like a first principles of your life  And it s pretty important to find those which affect your life in a bad way and get rid of them  As for useful values   listen what people  you want to be similar to  talking about what is important and make it as your new values and it s like a greedy algorithm  sometimes it fails but in general it will bring you to the goal ,1,0

With all due respect to the TechLead  you have to know about the 8 cognitive functions to really understand the difference between INTJ and INTP    It is very clear that you are an INTJ and not INTP  You are using Ni  Te  Fi,9,2
Agreed,1,
Def felt it when you took a depressed person as an example  I have a depressed friend who won t hear any of my advice  totally discard them without consideration  while I myself fought depression for over 10 years and succeeded at finding mental stability  You would think I d have something to teach  right  Yet some people are so stubborn and closed minded they won t let any light in ,3,0

Having 3 people to keep you accountable is wisdom    some times it s hard to see something when your knee deep in it where as some one from the outside looking in will be able to see easily the problem   usually   so I agree   getting more data points to make better decisions in life is what it is all about and going to people who have lived on this earth longer and experienced more of life and it s challenges to get their advice is key to avoiding obvious and foolish pitfalls and ultimately regret   how can you measure the success of a person     By the totality of regrets ,1,0

 There s an article for anything to justify any mentality that you have  right or wrong   This is why if you have a health problem  get it checked out and never Google it  You ll make it worse than it is ,4,4
 Chloe Anytime I Googled any little issue I had suddenly it got worse because of the fear and panic caused by looking at all the articles lol  I was like man I just had a little pain in my knee and suddenly I think I need to replace my knee ,1,
Plus they will always give you the worse case scenario  Because thats the nature of search algorithm especially when it s symptoms related,1,
There are malpractice claims against doctors every year  Putting 100  trust in a doctor who is overworked with student loans is not necessarily the optimal decision ,2,

Yeah  I agree with basically everything you said  I think people take pride in  living life for themselves   and while you should make your own decisions  I don t think there s anything wrong with conversing with people who are close to you like your family  In fact  I would encourage that  At the end of the day  your family knows you better than anybody else  and they can help you see things more clearly when you re faced with tough decisions  I think there s a concerted effort to destroy families and family values  and I think a lot of the problems we see today are the result of poor parenting  broken homes  and a large deviation from the foundational lessons you should learn as a child  I m not sure if this is a problem everywhere else  but I think that s the biggest problem the United States faces today  More and more kids are growing up with no real sense of morality or without parents at all  and so their decision making and human development are crippled ,7,2

I hope you re getting help for what you re going through  Divorce and the loss of a child is extremely traumatic  Personally  my family is toxic and my parents give terrible advice   so  it s not one size fits all ,2,1

 Remove expectations from people and you will remove their powers to hurt your feelings  If you don t like something  just take it away  it s only power is your attention     ,148,6
 Ro C You can still maintain deep bonds with people without having expectations,9,
This    thank you so much for this  I find myself stuck in a frustration loop with folks around me  typically just folks not being mindful or complaining with no want to find a solution or accepting there might now be one  but this is what I needed to hear  I set expectations far too high  and I let myself suffer because of it ,1,
This seems deep and all  But in the end you d just become someone who has no deep bonds with anyone around you  and there s no way that is a good thing  What you need to do is become able to endure and overcome when someone hurts you or don t meet up your expectations  That way  you won t stop bonding and will become a tougher person  at the cost of being hurt eventually  but not to the point of losing yourself ,16,
You make the decision  then self rationalize  I make excuses for avoiding my passion every day  I say  its too late  almost midnight    or  I need to study  then I dont study    or  I m just very tired today   I need to stop dicking around and get to work  not should  need   I m just writing this to remember it later  m kay    also thanks  wouldnt have realized it otherwise  probably  ,16,2
