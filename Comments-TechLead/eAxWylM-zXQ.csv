Come and live in Bali  I moved here since pandemic  The best decision ever  Many crypto traders just like you here  Cost of living is cheap  people are easy going  You have both mountains and endless beaches whenever you need to refresh yourself  No one needs to go to the mall here  No one needs fancy cars or clothings  Love your videos ,1,2
This guy is so lost in life  He sounds like a barely functioning adult tbh and keeps bragging about being a millionaire and being lonely at the top  Ok bud whatever makes you sleep at night  but seriously reconsider the priorities of your life  it s not all about the money,1,2

I don t know why is it so common  in Asian cultures that kids can t really figure out what they wanna do with their lives and keep hovering here and there to find what we really want  It s hard to talk to parents cause they can t really suggest much other than getting married or getting a job  kids keep wandering with limited options and thinking and look confused about their lives the entire time  This guy even after being a Multimillionaire keeps struggling with divorce and parental issues so you can imagine what it s like to be completely on your own and have no one to understand you because many people can t relate  me being a 23 year old Asian dude can somehow understand what he s talking about  Basically after doing everything our parents or society tells us to do we learn that it was all for nothing but a show just to fit in or prove to people that we re better than them but in the end you end up choosing what  you really wanted  but it become such a hassle to find that about ourselves as all our lives we re told to follow guidelines  without asking questions and it takes a long time to build this perception which he s talking about ,1,0
I don t want to spoil the party for landlords but so called executive suites cost about one fifth of Californian rent  and they only request very reasonable VAT ,1,1
Is there even such a thing as leaving your comfort zone once you have a cool mill in the bank   Furthermore  it would never enter my mind to live with my parents who are both extremely annoying in their own right   I appreciate his need to grow and explore  though ,1,1
Oh this made me laugh  cuz it s exactly what I ve been feeling about WFH and needing to get out of my comfort zone   Office and dim sum lunches  that s exactly what Silicon Valley living is like     ,1,1

Philosophical videos are back on the main channel  Nature is healing  Crypto was the virus ,1,1
It feels to me like this video came from a healthy place  Less cynical and still funny  taking life into an honest perspective  Wish you the best for your personal  and crypto    growth ,24,1
I ve never considered to go back and move in with my parents  for a number of reasons  But I can imagine I would be very addicting and hard to get rid of  Having to take care of all household tasks  100  on your own   And if you re traveling you don t even have your doggy  For some of us our furry friend is our best and sometimes only companion ,5,1
lol  he is on a run,1,1
I started watching your videos a few days ago and I m already a big fan  I think I am rebranding myself and it has helped me to put some things in perspective  Please stay fabulous and millionaire ,1,1
 So the other day I was driving   I wasn t actually driving my parents were driving   LOL,1,0
It is truly a strange phenomena how returning to the mother nest can really subtract your overall well being  I moved back in with my parents after graduating precisely for financial reasons and I too also became really soft  Even though I was saving boatloads of money it came at a high cost of dulling my character  personality  and energy ,6,1
Sounds like your parent s characteristics  personality and energy just rubbed off on you   You are who you are around   Remember that ,1,
You know that SOME countries will pay for tourists medical and dental visits       You re an admitted multi millionaire and YOU can t see that you could pay for a really nice traveller s insurance and US medical dental insurance  while travelling abroad   And that you could probably foot the whole medical emergency bill in a foreign country  if needed     No  I don t see you travelling outside the country any time soon  Luckily  you can say that s because of COVID   restrictions and self care  SOME people have NO desire to travel internationally   that s just how they are     You ve got too many excuses and not enough adventurous spirit  not that there s anything wrong with that     There s nothing wrong with no desire to travel extensively   maybe just admit it to yourself that this avenue is not going to make YOU happy and fulfilled   ,1,1
for me it s the opposite  i dont live at home my parents moved in to my home so i could take care of them,2,0
Living on the road is what Saint Paul did to spread the Gospel that saves souls from eternal hell    now that s an INFLUENCER ,1,1

    Oh man  that was good  I needed the chuckle      Come on  don t you think it was funny    He s an admitted multi millionaire for one thing and SOME countries actually will pay for tourists medical and dental needs   No  I don t see him travelling outside the country any time soon  Luckily  he can say that s because of COVID   restrictions and self care and not because he has no admitted sense of adventure ,2,

When you practice your daily gratitude habit  you should be thanking God for his gifts to you  He created you  gave you all your comforts and abilities  Your first class mind he gave you so that you could understand who he is and be thankful  Your life is not primarily for you to use for your own purpose  but for God s glory  Don t waste your life  Listen to a truth from 3000 years ago   Know that the LORD Himself is God  It is He who has made us  and not we ourselves  We are His people and the sheep of His pasture   Psalm 100 3,2,0
Next video   Why I stopped traveling and moved back with my parents even though I didn t actually move out from my parents  as a millionaire ,5,1
Lol was thinking the same thing,1,
This is the first time I ve seen tech lead cracked with the absurd things he s sprouting  1 58 I always find it funny when people took him too seriously cause he s obviously playing a character  making exaggerated statements while telling the truth at the same time  Mocking people while praising himself  It might be 99 9  of what he s really thinking but w  his Japanese bg  he s definitely not like that in real life  Or at least  not that tactless  But him mocking everyone and calling himself an influencer   lol  The guy can barely hold it in ,1,0
Finally you independent      Congrats   To me  I can t imagine living with my parents   also  even my parents don t want it either   Anyway I cheer you choice this time ,5,0
I live in the UK during Covid i have been learning Dutch  Next year i m moving to Amsterdam for 6 months to really enjoy travelling again and enjoy the language  I totally understand your decision have fun   ,7,2

How about that  Glad you moved forward   You deserve happiness  money is great  parents are great  but they don t define your life purpose   Time marches on  Do good  be good ,4,0
I knew you were going to say you d be back with your parents   I m starting to predict with great accuracy exactly what you re gonna say and do ,6,0
I moved into my parents house for awhile too  and while I saved a whole bunch of money I wasn t doing much to progress either   It felt like I was not being challenged and like everything was taken care of for me   In my city  if you re still with your parents you re still considered a baby and nobody takes you serious ,1,0

Traveling is a new really awesome way to learn and build friendships  Definitely a way to add variety  gain new perspective  and adventure  Congrats on moving out of your comfort zone once more    I plan to travel next year every two months too ,12,1

I think this is  good plan techlead  Why dont you visit some historical sites such as civil war battlefields  I plan to do this  You have inspired me to get out of my comfort zone as a multi millionair too ,1,1
I found working from another city was actually a nice change   You go somewhere else  you do your job  but then afterwards  you re in another place  Do some touristing  drive around  different scenery  There s just not enough to do in most cities these days to fill a day for a vacation  but with work  there s enough interesting stuff to make the evenings and weekends better ,6,0
I m in almost the same position  minus living with parents  and I started taking more trips recently and I really enjoy it  I think the concept of living somewhere boring and taking trips to places is very smart  This actually gave me some encouragement  Good stuff ,34,0

That s great  your new goal is to become a billionaire   ,4,1
It s really just a state of mind  A person can still grow while living with his or her parents  Your parents won t live forever  and they ll need your help later on  Plus  you can save considerably more money as a community of three instead of a solitary group of one  So spend as much time with your parents as possible  and at the same time  save  work  and live life knowing you have plenty of safety nets that will allow you to face the unknown head on ,96,12
 Scott Thomas yes I am  Abs you are not wrong with your points lol,4,
 James high crime rates  It s very expensive  Excessive Traffic  Have you been on their public transportation  Literally unsafe  No thanks lol   Are you from Cali ,5,
 B  R  Supreme Constitution I m not living in California lol  Never again ,2,
 Scott Thomas Maybe y all can pool your money together to buy a bigger house ,2,
 B  R  Supreme Constitution I don t think it s negative anymore  I wish I could live at home with my parents but not enough room ,3,
 Dream High Animation Good point  The  lying flat  movement  for example  otherwise known as     has become even more popular in China  reaffirming the normality of living with one s parents  unlike the negative perceptions often found in Western societies ,2,
 B  R  Supreme Constitution i agree   i think in the east is different where i dont need to move out and can still make money and stuff yet i can keep my privacy    the west mentality is different,6,
 Scott Thomas He simply needs a temporary change of pace in order to reaffirm his original rationale  This is a phase  On the other hand  given his age  it might be a burgeoning midlife crisis  Anyway  like I said at the beginning of my first comment  it s really just a state of mind  Maintain your objectivity  don t drown yourself in a sea of doubt ,8,
Are you tech lead from the past  Lol his exact reasoning before,1,
It s really nice that you can live in a bunker in your parents home comfortably  They must have provided a very supportive environment for you to achieve that level of success    ,8,1
Finally a solid video  Looks like parents had to kick you out of their place to force you to get your act together  as a millionaire  ,484,14
 Blackfeatherstill Bro  I thought it was a great video which I said right away  I appreciate the  life advice  videos much more than the crypto shilling ones that I dont even click on anymore  Rest of the comment was a joke  thought adding  as a millionaire  made it clear enough  Sounds like we both agree it was a good one  And looks like he already apologized to his parents  and they are taking him back  as a millionaire  ,3,
How do we know you have your act together Ziga  It is kind of subjective really  Some people might say that Tech Lead actually does have his act together  he expresses himself and reaches a wide audience  articulates often complicated ideas in rather unique  dry  humorous way  He might even be taking the piss about about all the people in the world who think they have their act together and actually don t  There is probably more going on in his videos than you are interpreting  or can ,3,
Come on now  the guy is qualified  has experienced some major issue time after time  wife leaves him  loses a great job  These type of events change lives  Most likely also blacklisted by former employer  making things difficult for him to secure a job that matches his high qualifications  It s for us to learn  I think you have to allow him to elevate himself with some facts  fact that he is a millionaire etc etc   You want him to just turn over and die  Rock bottom and then growth story here  let s be a little more mature about the situation here ,12,

Hi  I had the same dream to travel to Different cities and work from there because I m sick off my Environment  Unfortunately not every Company is open for that,1,1
I wonder if he has friends lol,2,1
Oh boy TechLead moves out  Does that mean I need to move out soon as well ,11,2
No you re not a millionaire,1,
You have a child when do you do the fathering thing ,1,1
It is really inspiring that TechLead still have the hunger to improve himself and challenging himself at his age  Not saying he is old  but you know what I mean  ,54,6
 Chris Rehr I admit that you may have a point here  ,2,
 Mikkel Allen I guess that in life you can t control everything  Your own experience and circumstances affect and shape your way of thinking  I think it is ok to not always have a clear vision  life is learning experience,3,
He s not old but your thinking is,3,
I am a big fan of this channel  as a man  and as a man I can say that TL lacks purpose and vision  So much Eastern excellence wasted as an American  As a multimillionaire   a real man  would fight for his kid and establish a secure home and create a legacy not a trust fund   not say  well they doing this an that to me    i don t like this affluent city  I don t like this mega tech company  this island nation doesn t understand me  my panties are too tight  my period  oh noooo   Watch long enough and he ll be bad mouthing his son  no doubt  If being a multimillionaire is so easy then get out of the  comfort zone    lmao  and try something hard like being a man  a father  a husband  a son  Support and up for your culture your history  your lineage   stand up for your future  Now THAT is REAL influence ,1,
Yep  good job TechLead    Inspire people   It will make a good story ,1,
I ve been longing for TechLead s dry humor for a while now     as a millionaire ,23,1
I feel TechLead is back ,1,1
TechLead posted  Where s my beverage  I m gonna need it for the dry humor  The best millionaire non comedian comedian on YouTube   What s crazy is I m about to do the same thing  kinda  I could be working as an RN but I have zero interest right now  Instead  as soon as my house is sold  I m going to Guadalajara  Mexico to get a job teaching English while I learn Spanish  do BJJ and finally learn how to cook  I want to slow travel the world  I figure doing the TEFL thing will help me get tied in as a local  Hopefully  my crypto will go to the moon and that combined with my small pension will give me a nice cushion  And of course  I m also about to start a YouTube crypto channel and a YouTube Travel channel  It s going to be great even if it sucks  Wish me luck ,23,2
Awesome   what does BJJ stand for ,1,
Now maybe your wife is going to return  Best of luck  as a millionaire ,1,1
At this point I don t know when he is trolling or being real ,4,2

 Barcid Studios  you got me thinking of this song   Imagine dragons   believer  ,1,
 Madara Uchiha Sounds like you will be able to give yourself a lot of credit if you manage to use your strengths  Don t bask in the drama of your life  just get a little better every single day even if its 3 steps forward and 2 steps backward sometimes ,1,
 Barcid Studios  every time I reflect on my life  I ve come to find that my fate in some certain ways was already spoken for  No matter how far back in time I would intend to back in my life  there just certain horrific events I m forced to live through  That s because my past has already cursed me with forces which were out of my control  If I knew back then that my family would be corrupt and flowed in standard that they made themselves to be  I would have just made more peace with my life faster  Although there is at least one huge thing I would have changed about my life  It would have started from 2015   I would have kept myself far away from this one con artist who would have played me for my money  Otherwise with the rest of my life  I would just accept that life is stupid  By playing   Nirvana  smells like teen spirit  ,1,
 Madara Uchiha I ve been rock bottom myself  When you lose everything you lose fear and when you lose fear you love the person you can become  If I could go back 15 years and tell myself one sentence it would be  Know the massive difference between happiness and fulfillment ,5,
I m trying to am at bigger things  I m trying to move out of my parents house  quit my job and avoid society  People who like to act like they know me upset me the most  And people who don t have guts to move forward with a big decision yet have the nerve to talk to me up set me just as much if not more  I know if I don t change my life  I m sure to die a failure ,2,
How about getting involved in your local politics and expand your horizons that way ,1,1

The thing with living with ur parents u can t even get laid is the main thing not easily or having to sneak around or even just dating n oh she meets the parents ur going steady then lol no one knows wth that means thesee days lol   But I think that s a good idea I feel the same way about this one and it makes me feel stuck I have to live at home cuz 2 things   and custody case ffs  Even tho the baby mom fkn abandoned her ,1,3

The question is   why were you living with your parents in the first place  as an ex Google  Ex Facebook  Tech Lead  millionaire ,7,3
From memory  after he left his Google job  his child was kidnapped by his now Ex wife back to her home country and he got Divorce gRaped  I don t blame him for moving back in with his parents  then ,2,
Move back in silly goose ,1,2

Snobby is the new cool  Everyone is trying to be so self deprecating all the time  it gets sickening ,3,
