i think facebook is failing because techlead left actually    top tips hmm   man i donno tho its hard to tech lead because sometimes you meet the   repeat what the smart guy sayed   guy and it really annoying sometimes you meet the  Use technical terms that i dont know  guy     sometimes you meet the  im here for the food  guy    and to lead it gets frustarating   i guess being honest about what you dont know would be the best tip and ask if you dont know it and if you dont understand ask again    because ive met people that kinda dont want other people to not know that they dont know   for me i do my research but no everybody learns that way also dont be shy to ask and dont be shy to say i dont know this ask someone that knows it    for example if i dont know something connected to tech i would deffenetly ask you but i will still do my own research   just to be sure    also test the things that someone teache you cuz some are wrong     ive seen wrong maths that are told to allot of people and they believe it    also like keep cool even if on the top like dont get full of yourself   and sometimes agnolage that you are an aishole its goot to say like to the team  i know that im might be an ahihole but this must be done     something like that     not speaking about you its an example    i dont know    also like i dont know   rest     i would reccomend rest or like give your employes the chance to rest because overwork can cause harm and lead to less productivity in the longrun   also read all code that you can just read to understand thats all pure reading of the code gives you allot of knowlage even if you are not a programmer once you kinda understand how things move and why its actually the best to learn that way   also it doesnt matter what programming lenguage the code is in its the logic that matters after that you can apply to anything    well this is tips i think are good have a nice day mr Techdeal    ,1,1
Ego  Ego  Ego    I am making more than that without being a Techlead    hahaha,1,0
Techlead   love your content   but also wish for you to have a solid family   the things of this world never end   but at this point   don t give up on your family   don t give up on your son   there is transformation out there  I will give one verse to you from Mark 8 36 36 What good is it for someone to gain the whole world  yet forfeit their soul    at this point of success   you have the ability to choose and consider how your son will grow up without a Dad  Nothing more important that having family   to fulfill the fiduciary role of a father   however the worldviews differ  does paper and success supersede the value of those that you are trusted to take care of ,1,0

 Shaurya Modi just do your homework kid,1,
 Hey Brother no u r not a billionaire   u r just an average human being   i am probably way more smarter than u  if we were same age,1,
 zombieat no he is American,1,
 Shaurya Modi So you mean employed people don t watch YouTube videos  With that logic you ll probably stay down there in thousands lol  Oh and you re pretty naive if you believe idea is worth more than  a dime  It s the execution and knowing ins and outs of your plan  understanding markets  revenue models and lots of other factors that makes an idea successful  I have an idea  flying cars  I m a billionaire now but it doesn t work that way kid,5,
 Nelson Ricardo i dont even worth thousands now  coz i am in high school now andddd great people not focus on money but focus on ideas  and you never know who can get a great idea anytime  And i think that u r unemployed too  coz have enough time to watch YouTube videos ,4,

How to become a tech lead  1  Keep up to date with your skills   expand your tech knowledge 2  Work on your communication  esp  with non tech ppl  3  Tell everyone that has any influence around you  e g  your manager  that you want to be a tech lead   if they know it they ll try to find opportunity for you to prove yourself,15,5
 RambleGamble   5 is really good  1 for that  Re 3  yeah you have to take the power and most of the work in proving you re ready to be a tech lead is on you but it doesn t hurt to make your ambitions known to people that can actually vouch for you    it s one of my methods that helped me get heaps of opportunities so it really works  Depends on your leadership team tho  ,1,
I disagree with  3  You have to take the power   5 Know about what others are working on  You ll be able to connect ideas and people will bring you into meetings   6 Know how to tactfully disagree  It trains people to see you on equal footing vs being a yes man underling  Good luck Karo  You will be a tech lead ,2,
