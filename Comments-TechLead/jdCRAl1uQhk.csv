Curious if anyone here has tried copy trading   What was your experience  I m relatively new to trading and I am looking study some traders and copy their open trades rather than investing myself and lose money emotionally ,84,4
 clark  I usually go with registered representatives  Nicole Ann Sabin  for example has the best performance history  in my opinion  and does offers 1v1 consultation to her copiers which I think is amazing  You can check her on the net if the need be  ,1,
 Ivy Theodore  Hi  where can I find traders to copy  ,1,
 Anthonio Rodriguez  I also have copied the trades of some experts in the past  Tbh its the easiest money I made on the market  plus you also get a learning opportunity while you earn off their expertise  Unfortunately  I still haven t gathered all the knowledge I need to DIY trades  but I m on my way  As long as you do your homework on who you re copying and what their strategy is  it s a nice hands off way to invest ,2,
I successfully trade in my own portfolio  and also follow others because I m interested in their strategies  I realized I ve got better at managing the trader s strategies too  There s nothing wrong at all with having someone far more dedicated manage some of your portfolio ,1,

 Ivy Theodore Nicole Ann Sabin  she was in the news when she revived Grumac in 2018   You can look her up online  there isn t much I can say here so it doesn t seem as if i am promoting an agenda,1,
 Smart Uther Hi  please could you share more insight for someone who is just starting out and  how do I reach the expert that assists you ,2,
 Anthonio Rodriguez I d suggest you look into passive crypto investing like liquidity farming  Staking and DEFI  Buy tokens which you know have huge potential to grow   good use cases  For me  I am under the guidance of a digital assets stock pundit and she provides entry and exit points on the security I focus on while I go about my other businesses  Investing has no one way to do it  eyes on the prize    Mistakes are expensive ,2,
A lot of stocks are down as well as crypto  Buy gold  30  in crypto  Investing is a long term game  don t worry about the short term As long as you invest in strong blue chip companies that you have conviction in  they will recover in the long term  DCA if you can ,3,
keep buying and investing in stocks or crypto soon Bitcoin will hit  100 000,9,10

In 2019  people have realized there isn t going to be one crypto to rule them all  You re seeing vertical solutions where XRP is focused on payment problems  Ethereum is focused on smart contracts  and increasingly  bitcoin is a store of value  Those aren t competitive  In fact  I want bitcoin and Ethereum to be successful,178,2

You are right because my first investment with Mercy Greg was  1000 and I earned profit worth  16 400,1,
I remember when I just got into crypto back in 2017 but later in 2018 I ended up selling it because I was dumb and I didn t understand it  I studied and learned and now I know how it works  Got back into crypto early in 2021 and looks like we have the same mentality  I admit that seeing a  50  hurts but it s not a realized loss until you sell  Now   I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 23  btc from day trading with kathleen rife Signal in few weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish ,60,11

I ve lost quite a good number of coins in the current dip I Just hope I find a way to recover from such a massive loss,9,7
I have been trading for about 6 months now and just about every trade backfires and slaps me in my face  Nearly impossible for me to catch more than a few points    I try to do top down analysis but it doesn t work for me   I say to myself  clearly I m in the 90  that lose money  so I open a demo account  do my analysis  then take the opposite of what I would normally take and get the same result  I m starting to feel hopeless  any advice for a struggling trader ,194,13
 Adam Jerome I m actually doing a long term investment with him  which I realize more profits at the end of the trade  I m not really going to state my earnings here but yes  his services are really good I recommend him,1,
 Marko Aidan I really don t do much  I have an account manager Alex Valentino who handles me trading  His trades are top notch and realistic  it s been a year now and he is still beats my expectations ,2,
I liquidated all of my coins and bought gold yesterday night  Got spooked by the downward trend across the board and decided I had enough of crypto  Pretty sure its best days are behind it  Got lucky this morning with Russia moving into Ukraine   although I really hate to profit off of the misfortune of others ,1,0

When it comes to the world of investment  most people don t know where to start  Fortunately  great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance,2,1
While bitcoin s wild price movements might seem random chill  they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets  Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance  it s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin  We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps  narrowly avoiding a long term bear market  This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don t back up their crypto assets  More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  I have made over 11 btc with 2 1 btc from day trading with Sarah D Barton Signal in few weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish  socialist You can reach  Sarah D Barton on  eI    m   sarah signals,2,1
As a newbie about to invest  you must have these three things in mind  1  Have a long term mindset     2  Be willing to take risk   3  Be careful on money usage  if you re not spending to earn back  then stop spending   4  Never claim to know   Ask questions and it s best you work with a financial advisor   I made it as a newbie by working with Brian Davis  and today I can show alot of my achievements,114,28

As you can see we are at the beginning of a new month and I feel  those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 2 BTC when I started at 1 5 BTC in just a few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Gonez Nas  I would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about or hold it and risk loosing all  hes also mentioned by most youtubers and trades via only telegram  Goldsfolio,96,0

The problem is that although this flaw in bullion banking is absolutely true  when phrased like the way you did especially on a platform like Youtube where most viewers are just the average joe  everyone thinks that you re nuts or some conspiracy theorist  When crazy things are done by global institutions  they are somehow perceived to be legitimate  and you d be mocked by the masses for believing otherwise  Just read some of the comments above  I never bother explaining things to others on Youtube  Not my job to do so ,17,13

The best way to find growth stocks  key features to keep in mind is as follows  1  Ensure gross margins are greater than 50  2  Ensure P E ratio is less than 100 3  Buy companies that are PROFITABLE  very important irrespective of sector  4  Debt to equity ratio is less than 30  5  Current ratio is above I 6  and a Float under 100 million One stock that fits the bill is FLGT  Fulgent ,22,21

If the FED increases interest rates  it is to combat inflation   If the  government  needs more money to pay its debts  due to increased rates  they will print it or increase taxes ,5,1

Nft s are a tough equation  Honestly I think nft s are gamble  You collect as much as you can and when the news hits maybe one of your selected nft s is the winner  Since I have been watching your vids Tech lead I finally found someone that speaks my language when it comes to crypto  Initially crypto was created to support all communities and help people find an alternative source of either passive or active income  but now the crypto space is dangerous and only those who are risk takers and do their research properly prevail  Or one might just be lucky and score too ,1,1

A wise man once asked a kid if he prefer one million dollars now or one million subscribers  the kid replied    hey man  I would like one million subscribers so that I could sell them my worthless course for 2 dollars each   raking in 2 million  Next I will just create a new token and back it up with that  1 million  Now I will leave myself with 100k worth of million token and slowly sell it as the price increases as I advertise it on my own channel   After hearing the kid  the man gave up on humanity ,1,0

 Ray smith You re correct  I don t lose money every single trade  but my main problem is trying to let my runners run  Very rarely do I catch big moves   Instead they go a few pips in my direction  then go against me if when I try holding them  Also my entries could use a lot of improvement  A mentor would be amazing  but getting one is easier said than done  If it s not too much to ask  do you know any legit ones ,1,
 robert anderson Don t listen to him  don t give up  Trading takes time months  even years  to master  even the pros learn everyday  Never the less  if you lose money no matter which side you take  maybe you need to look at how you are managing active trades rather than how you are entering them  My advice  find a mentor   And also  try incorporating the use of oscillators  Bollinger and pivot points into your strategy  And most importantly move to higher TFs 4h or 1D preferably   you ll thank me later  ,8,
Your problem could be your stop loss is too close or you re watching your trades too much  Place it and walk away  Or you could just give up  trading isn t for everyone ,2,

Would love to see a regular video series talking about each coin  what it does  is It actually being used or is it theory  looking at the docs and testing how well it actually works  I feel a lot of crypto is just hype and the blind leading the blind  Last big crypto I saw analyzed was kadena  Flowing the docs and testing  it had tons of errors  didn t hardly work etc    basically just a bunch of hype back by theory pumped it ,12,0

To be honest  from my point of view this approach that you want to present to us is not real  If you have managed to lose so much money from stock trading which by definition is a much safer place and with a much lower validity shared with crypto  automatically I will not follow your advice in a much more difficult field  crypto world   I wish you good luck ,1,0

  I totally agree with what you are saying   I started in crypto in August 2017  and I bought in   I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85  during the ensuing 4 year bear market   I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do   I wish I had bought more   I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Richard I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor Richard Golod who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past   It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research      I left his contacts in the comment below take care ,53,8

Right now  timing the market risk is incredibly high   The most important thing anyone making an entry into crypto can do is buy a combo of 60  liquidity pools and 40  crypto assets   This reduces the timing the market risk as well as provides a stable return   Long term the crypto asset if it a productive asset  will give you outstanding returns and long term that will provide you with reducing the timing risk that comes in a highly volatile market such as this   Since LPs tend to perform way better in such a high volume  Long term when volatility shrinks in crypto  it will be the best return   high volume low volatility is what you want in an LP    But right now and pretty much any long term crypto purchase  you want to do a combo of 60  LPs and 40  DAOs or gas tokens that can be put to work ,11,4

Its very hard to take you seriously when you clearly have personal vendettas against certain coins  as opposed to objective research  I ve notice in your last few videos you always make time to badmouth Solana  Cardano and Ethereum  yet you always talk Bitcoin up    the same coin you said was going to 0 in a vid you made last year  I don t know what Ethereum did to you  but spreading misinformation isn t going to stop it from flipping your primary holding  Bitcoin   You mentioned that Eth is down 25  while Bitcoin is only down 15    What you didnt tell your audience though is that while eth and altcoins drop more than BTC in dips  they also gain much more than BTC during bull markets  this is very common knowledge  Also  why didn t you tell your audience that Ethereum s return on investment over the last year has been more than 4 times the return of Bitcoin   Just be honest  and tell your audience that your shilling bitcoin because you want to protect your investment   I ll see you in 1   2 years  when Ethereum is worth more than Bitcoin ,6,4

if he s very knowledge  he wouldn t have lost 500K as he stated in the beginning,2,
No he really isn t he s known in the community for shilling his own investments and speculating heavily without much knowledge  This is the same guy who said Bitcoin was going to 0 last year    He has been making a point recently to drag Ethereum in every one of his latest videos  but he doesnt tell you that Ethereum s return on investment over the last year has been over 4 times higher than the ROI on Bitcoin  and its projected by many to flip BTC within the next year or 2  Do yourself a favor and watch someone who actually knows what they re talking about  like Sheldan Evans  or Andrew Jikh ,7,

The market is very unstable and you can t tell if it s going bearish or bullish You certainly can profit from trading Ethereum and your ability to achieve a profit will depend on the depth of your market analysis and has had a long history of delivering huge ROIs for investors  But there are also many other ways to make money from Ethereum including Ethereum faucets  referral programs  Ethereum mining and Ethereum staking your market knowledge and the underlying market conditions some of us don t know how to take advantage of this Eth ,1,2

This bull run looks a mix of the previous two  Currently the  PI indicator is about to indicate a Bitcoin top   According to bitcoin halving cycles  there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run  so  if  the PI indicator  and Bitcoin  might repeat asimilar bull  run to 2013  That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough  but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market  all this changed when I encountered peters  s service   although I have been into numerous services but Armstrong peters stands out with experienced expertise in the field  I must confess it wasn t an easy task learning the routes on trading but with his assistance   it was more  easier to understand   here are his details on          as  Goldsfolio  STAY SAFE    ,69,1
