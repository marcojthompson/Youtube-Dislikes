What about spamming the network ,1,0
the market tops every time this dude puts out a crypto video,1,2
Oh wow this is actually a great idea,1,2
Honestly  the idea of creating an app that lets you communicate with willing addresses is kinda smart  I m hyped to see where this goes   Hopefully the support for other crypto currencies will grow over time  and you could end up with the de facto place for anonymous users to connect  Lol if you ever need a junior dev  I m here  ,15,0
 email is dead   still  there we go web 3 0  requiring an email address ,2,2
It s been hard finding people to work on a project in this web 3 blockchain social network area   Found a few dev companies but they lack many parts and ways want to do this project   I thought about learning parts but will take too long and my strong part is ideas  marketing and funding ,2,1

Bravo  You are great ,1,1
I want to buy some Million token  but the gas fees are so high with etherium and uniswap  I think Techlead said something to avoid it with different coins or so ,1,1
Any plans to integrate with Binance wallets as well ,1,1
I feel like it s that normal learning curve for everyone  I ve also lost  100 000 trading Bitcoin last year  but so far now I ve been able to make double of that trading weekly ,3,1
Bye the way you are the  most technical coding Tech Lead  thaxs,1,1

4 53 Good job  you just made the same network as everyone does     you only added the crypto address    essentially removing the anonymity of crypto that you loved ,1,1
 The year 2021 has been like a rollercoaster so far  The mixed performances leave the crypto market in a kind of limbo  with analysts divided over whether it has lost its momentum after hitting an all time high earlier in November  Some believe it is entering a bearish phase  while others claim the latest dip will precede new record highs before the end of 2021  Right now is the time to invest  but it s important for the right reasons  Choosing the right investment strategy can reduce your risk and make the most of your money  Bitcoin trading is a lucrative opportunity  I have been able to make 9 btc in just  3Weeks of trading thanks to exclusive signals from Leroy Chang  a renowned and formidable trader ,1,3
I was thinking for merch you could sell techlead autographed key caps for mechanical keyboards as a millionare  or coffee cups with     as a millionare ,2,1
You Are Omnipresent,1,1
I cant help but notice his haircut  ,1,1
how can I apply for job in your new social network  ,1,1
Is it safe for the public to know your wallet ID   Like  if they then know your password  they can hack into your account   Shouldn t everyone try to keep their wallet ID secret ,1,1
Neat idea with useful utility  but I would refrain from adding any personal data like email addresses because it effectively turns Metafora into a registry that ties crypto wallet addresses to emails and essentially kills the whole aspect of anonymity  On the bright side  the Tech Lead can sell this hit list to the FBI as a deal to get out of trouble lol     At the very list I can imagine bots spamming and targeting wallet holders a lot more selectively which is dangerous ,11,3
fabulous ,1,1
Nice  Bulllish   MM  ,1,1
Will million token be available on coinbase  im waiting to hold it but only use coinbase ,1,2
Everything he says finishes with  as a Millionaire  ,1,1
ex meta,2,1
The fact that he can do this single handedly  enjoys doing it  and the way he shows absolute clarity on how it s built  it s yet another moment of confirmation that this guy really knows his stuff  Looking forward to more services apps  and technical videos  like this one in the MM ecosystem ,5,1
Good grief  This is super cool  Also  I would love to see a newcomer like this disrupt Twitter ,1,1
By the way  great haircut TL  Looking forward to  MM moon jacuzzi bar,1,1
I couldnt understanding jack about the technicals but Its exciting to losten regardless,1,1
Looking forward to the befriending feature ,2,1
Huuuuuge    But needs an humongous amount of marketing and or virality in order to be useful,1,1
The potential of this is crazy  Might be one of or the only place where Whales and Devs from all projects can hang out and compare notes eh      Powered by MM  better grab some quick   ,8,1
That would be cool if you didn t explain that Meta is based on a false idea previously  because your argumentation should still be valid ,1,1
it s a good one,1,1
Half of this video I did not understand about the technical side but became so interesting to just hear what he was talking about,3,1
This is awsome,1,1
I m not even in crypto but TechLead still makes me feel apart of the family ,19,2
then you must be lonely  IRL,2,
     ,1,1
when will MM be available on binance ,2,1
When will MM go on binance  I would love that    ,2,1
It s nice   I built such a web app  but you front run me  well done anyway,1,1
Nice,1,1
TechLead  you must perfect it and launch as a competition to twitter  add like hash tag capability and ability to add media like photos and videos eventually  all based on blockchain so no censorship  people are fed up with mainstream social media now ,3,1
Threw 400 at this  Let s see   ,1,1
nice tech  nice idea  unfortunately i dont believe in crypto but this definitely shows that tech lead is legit when it comes to tech,2,1
Appreciate the insight into the tech stack ,1,1
you are truly  THE  techlead,2,1
We need more of these tech videos  Love it ,1,1
I think the correct nomenclature should be Web3  Web 3 0 is a term coined by TimBL as the Semantic Web which has nothing to do with Web3 which is based on decentralized web ,2,1
I m the dislike button,2,1
Happy to see you have found yourself a nice little project for yourself there tech lead ,2,1
TechLead in arcteryx  love to see it,1,1
Actually a useful Product  Was wondering why you weren t seeking venture capital to start scaling up but then realized you don t need to  as a millionaire  ,4,1
That was so dope  This is the kind of thing that can change the way we can connect   and I feel like this is just the beginning,15,1

I m into your edits  very much ,1,
Now you can send a message to a random stranger for the price of  50 USD  yay ,3,3
So what exactly does  web 3 0  mean the CDN  email  web and database servers are not decentralized  The only decentralized is the wall address  what blockchain are the messages stored on  LOL,1,1
Lol,1,
Great job,1,1
God damn genius  ,3,1

Damn one of the best projects   ,2,1
Love the fresh haircut ,3,1
i m a complete noob  does this technology guarantee social medias of the future can be censorship resistant ,6,1
Something like this could do the trick  but it won t be this just yet  You need a crypto wallet  ETH  some MM token  an email address     etc  so there are way too many steps to be mass marketable  and the tie to email means it s not really private  I suspect ,2,
I am a newbie in the tech field I would like to help work with you to build the mobile native app for metafora ,1,1

Impressive  I can do the same if only my job dont take me so much time  ,2,0
pretty cool idea  great potential   excited to see how the project will evolve  you should look into integrating ens or unstoppable domain for user id too  would also be cool if user can check out others nft when clicking on their profile  like what rainbow and metamask already have ,21,0
