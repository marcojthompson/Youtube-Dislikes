I suggest an ashram retreat to work on your inner world  It will bring happiness and inspiration and hopefully facilitate to transition to thinking about others rather than yourself  You need water  good organic food  exercise and some type of outlet where you can help others  Your channel doesn t make the world a better place   it is currently breeding discontent and bitterness  Maybe some people cant change because they have accepted that they need to live as a machine  I pray for you ,1,1

 NV lemme also add that the court definitely saw his youtube channel and thought he was pretentious an self righteous and acted accordingly,1,
 NV I grew up homeless with a famous parent who doesn t know I exist take it from me this kid deserves money for his pain of not seeing his father,2,
 L I L V C I F X R that much money  Idk what yall lifestyle live but 5k for a kid till he is 18 is absolutely insane imo,3,
 Tom Nook does his child not deserve money,1,
 Ray Cromwell its good to brag about getting an apartment for cheap,1,
5k a month child support for 18 years is 1 08 million  So yeah it does ruin your life,11,
 Ray Cromwell he was joking the apartment is only  2000 per month,15,
 1mil is not even expensive in the Bay Area  It s a strange  flex  when the  average  home price in the Bay Area is  996 000   Along the 101  most houses are  1 5 2m now  In Palo Alto and Los Altos  you re talking  3 5mil for   2000 square feet    Most people I know working in SF who are renting apartments are paying  4 5k per month    Same goes for Manhattan  It s just not very impressive for a tech worker in the Bay Area to brag about a  1M property ,12,

Does the TechLead never have trouble with noise in all the apartments he s lived in  That s the reason for me to find a house ,6,3
 TechLead Building s material   insulation play huge role as well  Especially  when it comes to floor and ceiling noise  A lot of modern apartments look  modern  and  cool   but there is not much between walls and floors  which makes living in them like playing the lottery  in the sense that you re at the mercy of your neighbors  Families with kinds can be horrible neighbors  by the way  precisely because those kids run around  stomping on the floor above and making it impossible to concentrate and work ,2,
Good point  perhaps pay attention to the community and type of people  party vibe  professional vibe  etc    Still  can be hit or miss ,3,
Great video bro  I really liked this apartment  Looks pretty cool and gave me ideas like the projector ,1,1
It s cool to see that the tech lead uses Sublime Text just as me  Now I only need all his infinite knowledge ,1,1

I can truly relate to such a high tech minimalist apartment  beautiful uncluttered simplicity  That projector  I want one like that and the hk speakers must be a stunning entertainment event  But the bed does not do justice to such an eminent personality  it made tears come from my eyes to think of that Ikea mattress in your bedroom  Please take comfort in a bespoke H STENS bed  you deserve the best  Also you may consider drinking some French imported mineral water such as evian at the weekends  Otherwise an exceptionally well accomplished apartment ,1,2

I live in Vegas and for a million  You can get one hell of a nice with 3 or 4 bedrooms in new neighborhoods     For even  350 000 you can get a new 4 bedroom  around 1 800 square feet  It s call a gym  That will have everything you need to workout with and no community will have even close to a good gym has     The gym I goto in Vegas is called Las Vegas athletic club  It s a huge two floor buildings with over 500 pieces of equipment  Two lap pools  full indoor running track  lockers  showers and open 24 hours a day  There are also four of these mega gyms in each of the corners of the city    Also if he would purchase a home  He could have added a water filter system in to soften the water in the whole home  It hard to do that in a apartment  If not impossible ,1,0

  Kimbo Nice There is not a single source that I have come across that features a fluoride meter  If a TDS reading of 0 is the main factor of clean water  than ZeroWater is your kind of water   If you think that pitcher water is as good and even better than reverse osmosis  with independent membranes  than drink up ZeroWater is good enough for you ,1,
 Electrodexify Lol you got those numbers from a blog about fluoride where the guy literally just uses a fluoride meter  He doesn t actually know what each product filters out   just posts what the things the manufacturer has listed on their website  which he can t even count because ZeroWater has more than 23 listed    FYI the contaminants ZeroWater has listed are the PRIMARY contaminants that they are required to reduce under the EPA guidelines  They don t have the others listed like clearly filtered does because those aren t monitored by the EPA  I m sure if you contacted them they would provide the entire list like Clearly Filtered does   I can t even take you seriously  You definitely don t know what you re talking about  ,1,
 Kimbo Nice Only removing 23 contaminants is subpar for ZeroWater  Zerowater might be the best pitcher  But RO systems can remove at minimum 83 contaminants   ZeroWater is the budget option for those that want water that is good enough  but the water is still not free of contaminants   especially from a tiny filter crammed with 5 layers ,1,
  Electrodexify  You clearly don t know how filtering works  You re comparing apples   oranges  Different filters have different purposes  A reverse osmosis system is literally just another stage in the filtration system  ZeroWater has 5 stages  5 different filters with different purposes   RO would just be a 6th filter which is the membrane  RO would just be the filter stage that removes PFAS  chemicals   That doesn t make the ZeroWater a  placebo   All 5 of the filters it is using are doing the exact jobs they are meant to do  In fact a RO system uses the exact same types of filters as ZeroWater  Brita  etc   they just have the extra membrane filter  Also removing 100  of the metals   other solids is somehow not making the water cleaner in your mind  That s just being dishonest   shows how little you know about filters     The reason you don t see a RO in a product that small is because RO hinders water flow greatly as well as takes extra time because of the added filtering stage so you have to have a larger unit to produce reasonable amounts of clean water  Also  it s just lunacy to believe in a first world city that your water has toxic chemicals to the point where you would need an RO system  A RO system doesn t remove bacteria or viruses as it s not designed to do so  In fact because of the way RO systems work they can become major incubators for bacteria which is why if you re using them for that purpose   DON T  The other filtration systems are easier to use   more portable because they don t need a storage tank or way to remove the leftover brine  So again   different filters for different purposes     Even looking at the stats that include the places that have water with noticeable traces of toxic chemicals from pollution it s estimated to maybe turn into 100k cancer cases over the span of 100 years out of a population of 330 million  Even that number is bound to continue to diminish as those places continue to modernize their water systems     Again  you really need to take the time to understand these things if you re going to be spewing misinformation ,1,
 VertexSoup 10 years older with no friends and family  as a millionaire ex Google ,2,
 Electrodexify being pretentious is just part of the character and it s quite funny imo  didn t he say it was  2000 00 a month  Not sure where the million dollar apartment part is coming from in the title  but  2000 isn t a lot now a days  Here in WA that s a pretty average price  even inexpensive for some areas ,2,
 VertexSoup he sounds kinda pretentious  He drinks water from a brita filter and cheap moisturizer  The apartment doesn t look as expensive as he claims  unless he s joking ,7,
 VertexSoup Nah  he s fine ,4,
I m scared for him  He needs friends and a family  Especially as we all age  This may not be so funny in 10 years ,12,

The amount of hate you got for the coffee hour podcast was hilarious  I don t think people know the difference between you and your character  Or maybe they just don t understand the mind and thought process of a millionaire tech genius  demigod  ,150,13
they also hated his acceptance stance re  not fighting for his son  Many men would be wise to let it go and not waste money on lining up lawyer s pockets for a lost cause ,1,

I m of  the opinion that those who leave it to market dynamics to determine when to trade or not are either new to the Market or are probably just na ve  The market has seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders are taking advantage of the dip and pumping even more towards trading sessions  My advice to new investors  More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 10 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just few months of implementing trades with signals and insights from expert Josh Jhang  For crypto related issues  buffering Josh    You can reach him on TELEGRAM    Djoshjhang       ,4,2
So impressed knowing how much people talk good about Josh Jhang daily signals    he also helped me and my friends here in Germany to trade profitably with his daily signals,1,
I never doubted trading with Josh after seeing his POT  Proof of Trades  I made good profit last year  I hope to make more ,1,
