As a millionaire tech lead  you may want to look more into the tech code behind BTC and what the protocols offer before jumping to conclusions  Well designed crypto like BTC is extremely hard money    similar to gold except easier to transact with amongst other many other things that make it better  Imagine it s like the dollar when it was backed by gold  Something that can be trusted by all parties and not manipulated at the whim of a central entity  Which CBDC will USA and China use to transact between each other  I m sure either will be glad to use the others without question    right   The world really could use something like this right about now  Dismissing it by comparing to CBDC is like comparing gold to the dollar  Yes  we use the dollar now but only because most don t realize the FEDs ability to manipulate and how much it has been manipulated  That is all coming out now    I could be totally off base  Curious to hear your thoughts to these remarks ,1,
Yet still shill s for garbage platforms,2,
Everyone and their grandmother is saying BTC will go down to about  20K and that they what to buy there  That means it will not happen  The whales and institutions will be snatching the btc right before the retail investors get to buy   Many whales and institutions have been buying around  30K  I think that is our new floor now ,1,

Often spitting facts but that  CBDC is the next bitcoin  is real na ve  I guess you are joking but we have a chance at world equality and you think that people will want the same cash they already have but on a different type of computer  CBDC will just make it easier for people to transition to other cryptos,8,

   This  current  run looks a mix of the previous two  Currently the PI indicator is about to indicate a Bitc0in top  According to bitcoin halving cycles  there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run  so  if the PI indicator  and Bitcoin  might repeat a similar bull run to 2O13  That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year I was able t0 grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough  but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market  all this changed when I encountered Felix  s service   although I have been into numerous services but Felix is t0p Notch with experienced expertise in the field  I must confess it wasn t an easy task learning the routes on trading but with her assistance I earned a l0t   Felixtrades0 on lG,77,1

Bitcoin has seen massive momentum that has enabled it to erase much of the losses caused by the recent slump  This sell off was a surrender among investors  and many clearly feared that the multi month uptrend that led BTC to its all time highs was over and a deep regression was imminent  Nevertheless  the bulls have now gained full control over the price development of the crypto and are now able to record a clear further upward trend in the short term  i do say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait to contnue incur more losses along the line  instead find away to grow up your portfolio I was able to grow my through the help of Raymond Anthony Sammak which I have made about 10 btc lately  you can reach out via tele gram raymondsam01 for more info,29,4

This  Diamond Hands   Paper Hands     HODL  Movement is the dumbest thing I ve seen in a while  I rather take calculated risks  sell  so I can be able to re enter at a discounted price than  HODL   These people haven t heard of a Limit Stop Loss and are getting dumped on by whales who control the market    I truly shows you how many inexperienced people have entered the crypto   stock markets thinking they are going to be millionaires soon ,1,1
    current  rice action is not abnormal for a bull  arket cycle   and   rices could still resume their recent uptrend before forming a longer term peak  There are definitely still some downside risks short term  and  arkets rarely rebound in one single move up  Thats why at the moment its way more reasonable to stack up more B   by tradling the asset rather than hold waiting for the  arket to skyrocket  I have been a     holder for a very Iong time now but I truly unlocked the full potential of     when sought the council of Tom Carlton  with my high lnvestments I have been able to make 21    in just a year tradn with his s gnal despite the up and down of the mar ket  believe me  he is way ahead of other tradrs  Tom can easily be reached on t l   a    tomcarlton,13,2
This is a fairly novel argument from everything else I ve seen  CBDCs will make it so that you will never be able to introduce gains from soon to be worthless   illegal alts into the financial system without leaving an actionable trace  The only places you will be able to pay with crypto are trap houses and taco trucks   CBDCs will have the military might of their respective countries backing them and will use force to make decentralized havens a nightmare  Most people crave order  people crave insurance  and people running things   Ive gone through hundreds of comments and nobody has a good counter so far  As someone who is also holding bags I want to hear a good counter to Techleads points ,24,18
 Ronnie people get personally offended when their position on crypto is challenged    Yes you are correct BTC was originally designed to be a hedge against inflation  but if you honestly can t see how that s not going to work long term my little YouTube post won t help you  Hold with diamond hands  ,1,
The counter is that there is no going back to centralized money   and as far as governments making it a nightmare that will probably happen  but it doesn t mean it will stop bitcoin and other cryptos from continuing to do their thing    People who believe in decentralized money will continue to grow and support the network  even if  requires more clever tactics than used currently  its inevitable crypto will take a blow from regulation but it also seems inevitable that it will come back stronger from that blow  Have to ask yourself if you really believe in decentralization,1,
 Alex F you raise a lot of important issues and concerns   Indeed we re headed to a more dystopian future where governments have ever increasing amounts of power and control over their citizens   Also you re right about the so called pandemics ,1,
  Alex F Fair enough response  The is what the MSM would like you to believe  Keep an ear to the ground and you may start to hear a different tune   Folks are getting sick of the overreach and manipulation  The entire middle and lower class in being backed into a corner  I sure hope instead of a violent revolution we have a monitary revolution and with the still  for the time being  at least mostly free flow of info online we may have a chance   It will be a battle no doubt but bankers are smart and they may see the writing on the wall and join the enemy they cannot defeat outright  Remember the pentagon has war gamed scenarios where crypto is used to oppose the govt  This would not be done if it was not serious contender on the world stage   The future does not include decentralization unless the people demand it buy voting with their dollar and whatever minuscule power to vote through politicians that remains ,1,
For several months now I ve been thinking roughly the same thing that techlead is talking about here  Sadly  governments are all powerful when it comes to this  and I find the idea that governments would just allow a decentralized  privacy first cryptocurrency to strip them of financial control over their citizens and the economy  to be extremely naive  We re moving towards more and more centralized control  more bureaucracy and less privacy  and this ties into others trends that I ve been noticing  First off  governments around the world have by now realized that even citizens of supposedly free democratic countries can be locked into their homes for a year  given that the outside threat is claimed to be sufficiently large  this means that there is pretty much zero effective resistance that people might exert  Also other things  like climate change are being used to paint an apocalyptic threat that justifies pretty much any regulation  since the other option is the supposed extinction of humanity and the destruction of the planet  which many people do actually believe  I m also seeing a connection between this type of fascination with a government issued digital currency and the goals defined by the so called great reset  A centralized digital currency  which allows governments to track and trace any transaction and have total financial control would be a prerequisite for a type of system where nobody owns anything  goods are only used  leased  shared and distributed  meaning that the government has a complete overview of any of their products  lifecycle and their citizens  interests and activities  so they would know what to produce and how exactly to ration  This of course results in a regulative monstrosity that is pretty much impossible to get out of  let alone fight against  since privacy is non existent  and everything is out in the open    What really annoys me in all of this  is that there mostly seem to be 2 kinds of people in relation to their reaction to these trends  One that is completely unaware of them  and the second one  which doesn t care  saying that as long as there s food on the table and there s multimedia entertainment to be had  it s not gonna be too different for me either way  There is actually a lot of fascination with a Chinese style system among regular people these days  I often encounter people who express that free democracies are sluggish  as they don t have the necessary power to act when action is needed due to all the unnecessary controls and debating in parliament  People don t seem to care much about freedom these days  Or rather  the only kind of freedom they care about is the freedom to change their gender  The social media giants probably have a lot to do with this   I m really looking for anything that could make me more hopeful about these things  so please prove me wrong and tell me how I m misinterpreting these trends  Meanwhile  I think it s still good to hold on to crypto  even if not from a financial  but an ethical perspective  I m just holding out hope that a decentralized future is still possible ,8,

Momma ain t raise no bish  You can have my crypto after you pry it from my cold dead virtual wallet  HODl 4 lyf ,2,
 Ronnie also Bitcoin is inflationary also since the  cash out  value  at least thus far is tied to a fiat currency  For it to not be so you d have to believe in the future you can use Bitcoin for all purchases everywhere  another  what if   It also doesn t make sense to ever buy anything using BTC since it is a supposed appreciating asset  so if i hadn t bought anything I d have X amount of purchase power increased next year etc ,3,
 Ronnie the infinite amount of  alt coins  that are produce or could be in the future ,2,
 Self Less What competition   are you suggesting Inflationary CBDC s are competition ,1,
 Ronnie then your convinced if this happens Bitcoin will remain dominant despite all the competition  Even if your right about your original prospect you have to then say Bitcoin will remain dominant    it s a long shot to say the least  there s just easier ways to make money that don t carry all the  what if s  or risk    just doesn t make sense   my point wasn t that governments would ban it to stop illegal use  it  was  that they make too much money off currency manipulation to lose control over the currency  Sure you could go to countries that allow the swap to fiat but who s to say how many of those will  It s all too speculative  and there s just easier ways to be profitable ,1,
as soon as people realize CBDC s are inflationary  they ll want to use bitcoin   I don t know about ALTS but the only way GOV can make BTC illegal is to go full authoritarian   Also  govt has more to gain by keep alt s legal  read      tax monies  rather than spending tons to try to make them illegal   Surprise  govt outlaws drugs and yet the drug market is bigger than ever   Making crypto s illegal will just cause an explosion of black markets   The tech is already here  e g  TOR and coins like FIRO  you will start to see the proliferation of mainstream dark web markets and dark web defi exchanges   As soon as tech like IPFS and deFi platforms make the move to TOR it will be impossible to stop   As soon as CBDC s become legal you ll see that there ll be ways to move dirty cash into CBDC s and from there into BTC   physical cash will always be king   They ll never make it illegal because they re the number 1 crooks that use it for illegal purposes   Elites and billionaires always leave loopholes for themselves in laws   https   www icij org investigations fincen files hsbc moved vast sums of dirty money after paying record laundering fine  this one suggests the US could actually stop Tax Havens with regulation  let me give you a clue  it will never happen    https   www icij org investigations fincen files five ways biden could crack down on dirty money and financial secrecy  Govt s will never make a system so secure that even they are locked out of it    Also  if US locks everything down  people will just move to a country that allows them to cash out their BTC for the local currency   The US will never want all these people to leave and take their money with them   They d rather collect the tax dollars ,6,
Agreed  People seem to think just because it s a good idea it will succeed without any intervention from the governments  Blockchain can be applied to any  official  currency and allow them to continue manipulation  tracking etc  so why wouldn t they    the 2017 crash also didn t have China Iran bans and who else might follow soon  Looking retrospectively at previous crypto swings for a prediction of the future is not a good idea in this scenario ,4,

This correction was expected to happen around 2022  But it s alright  Bitcoin is not going anyway because its purpose is to make an economic point  recessions are caused by central banks manipulating the money supply  Bitcoin was NEVER designed to be a coin for daily payments  Not sure how people still don t understand this after 12 years  To this end  the Bitcoin experiment seems to be a success  All the technological bullshit or concerns about the environment are irrelevant really  On the contrary  Bitcoin makes the point that we need cheap renewable energy now and that governments should invest in this with priority  I lost about 8 Bitcoins in this lifetime by selling 5 once when they were about 100 dollars and the other 3 when Bitcoin crashed to 3000 dollars  Even so  if Bitcoin next year seems to be going to 250K  I m pretty sure I ll be buying this dip because third time s the charm ,2,0

 Thanks for this  thanks for the great insight  I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like isaac bourke  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 5 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy  You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE    GRAM   isaacbourke ,54,11

No  Wrong  This is part of the normal functioning of the Bitcoin algorithm  These boom and bust cycles are the WHOLE POINT Bitcoin tries to make relative to our real monetary system  It experimentally shows that central banks are the cause of recessions because they manipulate the money supply arbitrarily  The money supply in Bitcoin is programatic and that s why it  crashes  every 4 years or so ,2,

Bitcoin is just a version of the  tulipmania  that ruled the Netherlands mid 1600 s  It s baked air  Great video though    ,1,1
The video is better than the last one on bitcoin   I can tell that you read comments from your viewers  It it true that there are other ways to hedge against inflation and I recommend using those other hedges against inflation as well   As they say don t have all your eggs in one basket   However just because more than one hedge against inflation exists doesn t mean that all but one of them is pointless   The biggest advantage that bitcoin has over those other inflation hedges is that bitcoin gives you full control over your money   If you use it like it was intended then you keep your bitcoin and you don t need centralized organizations to transfer it to people or exchange it  It s very difficult for the government to take it from you if you are using it properly   The goal is for a digital asset that can operate without any governments and without the interference of governments   I know it is far from that goal because the internet is controlled by a few internet service providers  but decentralized internet is also being developed    I can see how it s very difficult for people in the united states to understand the importance of this   The united states government has been very stable and on top for many years   You have to understand that Bitcoin is for all people around the world and not all governments are as stable as the united states   Some governments are close to collapse   You have hyperinflation and government debt problems in Venezuela   In North Korea what happens when the ruler dies   What will Russia be like when Putin dies   What will the China be like when their ruler dies   You need to look at the bigger picture and look at history   Did everyone forget when wealth was confenscated in China and Russia in the name of socialism   In reality they were are dictatorships but that s not the point   China has had many dynasties   Rome a republic like the united states  changed to a dictatorship when Cesar took rule by force   It wasn t that long ago when most of the governments around the world were monarchies   The people of Rome probably thought that Rome would always be the best  and the monarchs probably thought their government would always be a monarchy   The fed coin is exactly why we need bitcoin   We already have visa for digital payments   There is no purpose to the fed coin except to give the government more control over the momentary system and more control over it s people   It can be used to track people and to control the money   It basically takes power away from banks and give full control to the government   It s no surprise that China was the first to issue such a system   China is known for oppression and maintaining absolute control over it s people   The fed coin is a move that make the united states closer to how China is   No one likes the big banks but when the government takes control of everything and gains excessive power it s not better   Russia and China being good examples     If you lived in China  North Korea or any other oppressive government  and were trying to escape  you would probably rather have US dollars than your governments currency   When the united states becomes like those very governments that you are running from then you will want bitcoins instead of US dollars   Other assets like commodity contracts can be easily frozen and confenscated from you by your government because they require the use of organizations that will cooperate with the government ,1,1
Gold has been tested by thousands of years  of time and hundreds of different civilizations across the world to be a safe store of worth  not to mention its use case in jewelry and industry materials   A property that has no mass adoption and history of less than 10 years simply does not deserve the title of next gold as it s never been tested,6,5

 Pierre Miniggio Pumping up crap coins with your viewers and then taking profits for yourself is deceitful  but it s in NO way a pyramid scheme lol ,4,
 Pierre Miniggio You could do that with traditional stocks  Are you calling them a pyramid scheme too  edit  Also  for something to be classed as a pyramid scheme it has to be made up of multiple features that when combined will create a pyramid scheme  You cant just say that because value can be obtained from controlling a market that it entirely constitutes being a pyramid scheme ,9,
 The Situation  there is no gain for enrolling others  There is value though  That s how popular crypto youtubers pumps some alt coin by making a video about  and then sell for short term profit  leaving their viewers with crypto holdings that is slowly losing value after that spike   So yeah  people do use crypto as a pyramid scheme to make quick profit ,6,
 Random User I think you are right    But I think I m going to join this pyramid scheme and buy Bitcoin when the price hits 18 000   the same as tech lead,6,
 Random User OK    so    Bitcoin isn t a  business model   that s the first thing  Second thing is  there is no gain for enrolling others and there s also no promise of payments or services  Bitcoin isn t designed for people to profit  because  again  it s not a business model    it s designed to be a currency in which it s primary function has become a store of value  or not  given the volatility  ,21,
Yes it s a pyramid scheme  From Wikipedia  A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme  rather than supplying investments or sale of products  As recruiting multiplies  recruiting becomes quickly impossible  and most members are unable to profit  as such  pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal ,17,

Extremely point by point video   Well I will also say this here   Most people don t understand the concept OF  buying the dip   buying the Dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling  off  when the price rises just as the current market is down  Holding is great  Although trading is far more profitable  I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough  but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyse the digital market  All that changed when I encountered Gray Ken Services  I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Gray Ken that has made me over 16     This is his details on             Grayken2   for his assistance on strictly crypto related plans ,93,8

 Renaldi Roekanto this is a valid argument for the price to go up but my theory is they will soon be raising interest rates leading to massive drops in Crypto  Stocks and housing  Personally im heavy in cash in anticipation of this also have some Gold and Silver incase of a currency crisis  But generally I beleive that if interest rates rise or on the off chance a currency crisis happens the best performing assets will be precious metals while the everything bubble popping will give me a opportunity to allocate my fiat into other assets at lower prices ,1,

 Adrian A I m in for quite some time  This is a repeating cycle  After every pump over all those years there were this people coming out of nowhere forecasting the end of crypto etc  etc  After a few years crypto reached new highs again and everything started from beginning again  so also this time  And also this time it will reach new highs again and people again will be crying for not entering when it still was  low  ,9,
you sound delusional  its already happening and even if it rebounds from now if you would have followed his advice to this point you would have a net gain in crypto assets of 17 000  per btc  how can you argue with that  HODL is not the way in downtrends that are this extended  TRADING is  why watch your portfolio go down when you can swing trade off the trend channels and make gains while it drops  Thats what the whales are doing and will continue to do until they feel they have a tighter grip on the market  This helps no one but them and institutions  Retail traders are becoming less of a minority in btc total distribution and this will make manipulation even easier for them in the future ,12,

 De Fi nancial Freedom in Dec 2020 I had 50k left after losing 450k in 2 months of bad emotional trades and I told my brother let s go all in vet  was around  001  002  in Dec 2020  I told him I ll give him half of all and let s contribute all our w2 income  I made more than him  basically I gave him an offer he shouldn t have refused but he did    we both would ve had over 1m each after tax lol  ,2,
 RM relax thev mindBTC can t even reach  400 anymore  So many coins have been lost ,1,
 Garden State Shake prob meant 30 racks,1,
 De Fi nancial Freedom I turn 70k to 210k then went down to 35k in March then I waited till 100k to use leverage and turned 100k to 500k from July   Aug  50k worth of vet non leveraged turned to 100k in sep  that bag alone would ve been 3m  at vet peak at  30 cents  and 50k leverage on kraken turned to 400k,1,
 De Fi nancial Freedom I put in 70k of personal loans all in mid dec 2019  I bought a bunch of icx at  12  matic at  002  vet at  0055 eth 165 xrp  15 xlm  045 etc I had like 500k worth of crypto in beg of sep when btc was only 10k,2,
 Luca A I had 500k  worth of crypto in sep from having nothing beginning of year and then I yolo gambled it on options but if I held would ve been worth 10m ,2,
Total crypto mc went from 500b to 2 5t and last peak it hit 1T  But with money printing and lots of more investors retail and institution it ll prob hit 4 5T before downfall back to 700b 1 2T 2022 2024 before going back up to 4 5 7 5t by 2025 2026,3,
 Luca A too much money printing and stimulus and inflation and I see crypto app getting downloaded 100k  a day  Also bull runs usually last longer till end of year like 2015 2017  Current bull run started 2020 ends 2021 approximately,5,
I would buy at 30 euro  a bit overpriced  but I m willing to take the risk  ,4,
 Michael Y Kwon i really don t know how you can be so positive  ahahah 100k  i still don t know if it will ever raise again onestly,1,
 Luca A if stocks collapse bigly yes but I don t see it with all the money printing so 20k is lowest as retest breakout confirmation but could also be 32 33k before continuing uptrend if market keeps going up next week   btc will prob hit 100k 120k by dec jan2022 and within 2 years 2022 2024 btc will see 15 20k again,4,
Wait for 400 ,8,
wait for 10k,1,
19k support,4,
Wait for 15 20k,8,
its going to ZEEEEEEEERO,1,0
At minimum Bitcoin has to double every 4 years at minimum because of supply reductions   due to its halvings  If you have only 20k then over the next 4 halvings you should see 40k  80k  160k  320k  and those are likely the absolute minimum values in 16 years time   Why minimum values  Because those mins reflect the cost price to actually mine BTC  which costs twice as much every 4 years   But if you consider the speculative bull runs which pump prices then you could catch the peak at  1m in the next decade  from a 20k investment in 2021    All I would say is wait a few months  put in  20k near bottom  then just forget about it and it has to grow over time  That is the advantage that Bitcoin has over 98  of all cryptos    it s halvings   And Bitcoin has  the name   And none of these hype coin investors understand why Bitcoin is real and their cryptos are not  Other crypotos have nothing backing their  values   but Bitcoin has real world electricity and equipment costs backing it with a genuine physical world value  But most people will never understand that  Bitcoin is genius  a level playing field for mining  and you hold your keys to your own wealth and get to control that wealth yourself ,5,6

what  he sold at 50k right  and he buyback at 20k possibly right  thats awesome since he can buy more bitcoin when its price dip  tho im not saying hodler is bad  its just he can buy more because he sold it before it dipped ,1,
5 Videos about crypto  I suppose that TechLead sold his Crypto to early and trying to influence us into selling so he can buy in cheaper again  Don t listen to this guy and wait patiently  For real  What is better  Apple  Google  Facebook or other large companies with large server systems that does the exact thing and is equally terrible for enviroment  Or a Decentrilized system that none owns that gives you same quality without owning your data ,14,1

 yes what s the value of Bitcoin  The intrinsic value of a company is the sum of its future cash flows  Gold has use in space  microprocessor industries  jewellery  chemical industries  etc   What is the use and value of Bitcoin  Pay for drugs  Purchase guns  Support terrorists  Tax evasion ,2,
I also think it will eventually hit 0 or close to it      also as a millionaire who made     off Bitcoin   sure it might go up again a couple times  but that Doesn t change my view the long term ,1,
 yes he doesn t see value  there is no value in it ,6,
  4evahodlingdoge problem is it will probably never hit 18k and he ll end up FOMOing at the top of the market  again     if you see value  you buy it  timing the market is for the ignorant and low IQ  even the best professional traders dont beat the S P500  invest  don t trade gamble ,5,
He did say he will buy backi n at  18k  He realized that Bitcoin and every crypto is a pump and dump and that s what he s going to start doing from now on ,3,

I predicted at the beginning of the year that BTC would drop to  4 000   But I also predicted  at the same time  that it d jump over  100 000 in the mid 2030s   But who knows   Literally no one   My opinion is worth    0 00   Edit  it is sad seeing companies getting into crypto   The point of crypto is to take money away from the banks and destroy them as a sort of revenge for their intentional crashing of the global economy in 2008 2009 ,12,2
Coincidentally  your opinion is worth as much the intrinsic value of 1 BTC plus 1 DOGE  I do think it s funny that cryptards get excited as institutions get closer to regulating crypto and making it more fiat like  and less appealing  in the process    But I disagree with you about the point of crypto   it s meant to be a distributed ponzi scheme that makes the implementer and early adopters rich at the expense of silly bagholders who buy in when prices are stupidly high  The various narratives  e g   fight back against the evil banks   or  deregulated money hide from the government  are just useful tools to make the coins more attractive for niche groups of buyers   People who actually use the stuff don t need any particular coin to transfer value ,3,

In the three months stablecoin and bank coins need a competitor such as Bitcoin  which I think it will hover around B24 000 and then take a nose dive to B18 000 and from there it will climb back up to where it was in the summer period  and i would buy bitcoin at it lowest and the very same thing with Ripple and CBDC coins when they are issued ,1,0

 All I post is peaness by 2024 we will all be on some kind of CBDC and then the discussions will be which has the longest expiration date  All CBDC will be expirable so as to  encourage  spending it to boost the COVID damaged economy  That s the ostensible reason  In reality it will be to ensure everyone s perpetual inability to save money and thus have to keep working for the ruling  master race   Just keep watching  It s already happening due to the collective stupidity and ignorance of almost everyone in the world for the past century ,15,

People like Bitcoin because of its decentralized and private nature  Who wants the government tracking all of our payments more than they already do  That s why people still use cash these days  Bitcoin is limited in the amount of coins that can be produced so it literally makes sense that it will go up over time especially once all coins have been mined  21M   I believe it will only be used as a digital gold but that it s designed perfectly for that  Also logarithmically it s been following a strict pattern that many people feel is inevitable based on how it works ,1,0
Its a normal annual crash  Nothing changed ,2,0
This is why bitcoin will never die  No one wants to be tracked and traced on every purchase ,4,1

 Joseph Souchak ok at any point over the last decade you could have also been down on bitcoin but when you average over the same decade it has risen  240 PER YEAR  Literally 10 years from now and looking back there are only 2 options bitcoin is either higher or lower than it is now  I dont see anyway that bitcoin goes to zero,1,
 Joseph Souchak there might be a brief crash this weekend  like he said 18k is a good dip to buy  and since next week is the inflation reading  it might be good to buy  tho if bitcoin price direction the same as tech stock price  it might be going down further for more week or so ,1,
 Joseph Souchak I m also holding for the long term  If BC does drop to 18 000  I will put in another  100  and ride it up to 57 000 again  Crypto is like Paypal  It is to widely used in the world s democracies to ban now  More regulation will probably come  but it will not be banned in the US  Canada  Mexico  the UK  Japan  Sweeden  Switzerland  etc ,2,
 Joseph Souchak If you are down only 20  you bought at a pretty good price,1,
No he s just cashing in on the crypto craze,2,
Realism  More like fear mongering  Umm Bitcoin has ALWAYS been volatile  its called price discovery  It will continue doing this for the next 10 20 years before its so massive and doesnt move in big swing up or down  It s SIMPLE be in bitcoin LONG buy and NEVER sell ,8,

I don t understand you saying Bitcoin is like gold   Gold holds its value consistently  even in a uncertain times  which makes it stable   Its value also trends upwards over time   Bitcoin goes up and down like a fiddlers elbow   it s very inconsistent   not a good  store of value IMO ,18,5
Setting up multiple computers across the world creating immutable finite monetary divisible transferable  data that is traced and can be communicated with anyone on the planet and has never had a faulty transaction on the network is a better way of storing value or just define it in general  Trust is the base function humans determine value  Then it s utility  then application  mass wide adoption  which leads to innovation in that network of value  It is a great store of value because it actually defines value for us perfectly  by simple supply and demand based off of energy consumption or  Proof of Work   It s really better than printing a bunch of money at problems and it s crazy how ppl don t even think it has value and they can t even afford 1 of essentially what they think is nothing    If you don t have a little bit of Bitcoin rn you must really 100  trust in whatever gov  you are a part of ,2,

Bitcoin isnt a currency  that seems to be what techlead is missing  Its not going to be used for every day transactions just like gold isnt  Its a store of value asset  Regulation  tax  transaction fees  all irrelevant  Short term crypto prediction is a mugs game  the only certainty is the long term value increase of bitcoin  and by long term i mean 5  10  20  50 years ,3,5
A store fo value that drops to half price in a week  lmao ,1,
It s a failed store of value that drops 50  in a week ,1,
They are bringing regulations     Banks buying this up across the board   Later they will sell you this at more expensive prices,1,1
the problem with comparing it to gold is that bitcoin doesn t have any of the properties that made gold desirable as a commodity   Note that they call it a  coin  even though bitcoin has not physical form and cannot be accurately described as a coin ,1,0
Im buying  ,1,0
Love the mindless crypto bulls  Ever seen a speculative bubble before  Look at literally any time something pumped and what happens after ward  Things need to cool off for six months to a couple of years  Then eventually if the fundamentals are good   the speculative cycle starts again  Don t be mad  Just look at history  Even crypto history  Same thing over and over  Not a big deal ,3,1
Umm  the reason crypto exists in the first place is to avoid and circumvent mass government control and over regulation of currencies  as is the case expected with the digital Yuan  The only reason that coin is allowed to exist is due to the CCP s chokehold on the Chinese populous  I think TechLead is missing the point of this entire debate  or maybe he is in desperate need to shift attention into panic so he won t feel too bad about losing a shitload of money by selling early ,1,0
So many angry bitcoin bulls in the comments  Get a job  ,4,1
BTC to 500K   ,8,2

Crypto is a Ponzi scheme   It is incredibly thinly held with 95  of the public unware it still exists or what it is    Paper profits from BTC were used to inflate Etherium and other select  coins    There are thousands of coins  another is invented every hour so they are no different than the famed Tulip Bulbs that seemed like such a great investment until the reality of the product became known   In this case  the  value  is entirely driven by  hype  and nothing more   As soon as the media starts to  hype  one of the thousands    it goes up   There are laws against that type of market manipulation but they are ignored ,1,0
Celebrating Crypto carnage  Good time to shorting it,3,1
bit late for the party    been shorting it since it was over bought like 2 months ago from  63k,1,
The problem with crypto is that it is heavily manipulated and it is easy for someone to get rich   The stock market is also heavily manipulated   Problem is if you sit on the sidelines  everyone else will be rich while you sit there ,8,0
Put your money where your mouth is and short BTC to the ground  ,6,0
Crypto will either be outlawed or regulated to the point of worthlessness  The people who control the central banks and have for CENTURIES will never allow Crypto BTC to take them out What is coming is the worst financial collapse economic collapse in human history  it will be worse that the great depression  They have printed 10 trillion  in just 16 months with no end in sight they want to CRASH the dollar it s all intentional what is happening Every country with a central banks has already announced their own Government controlled digital currency  The US will have FED Coin BTC Crypto will not exist as it now does by 2025 ,1,0

Technical analysis  I m disappointed Mr  The Techlead  Didn t know you were into horoscopes,1,4
yea   but most times the direction of the share product doesn t correlate to the news releases   especially in forex  Example   A company releases some financial statements indicating positive growth for the company but the price of the share drops    so shouldn t trend line following be best    i think that is why techlead is drawing the lines on his charts    but who knows,1,
i love ur videos and ure persona a lot  but i dont get the dramatization  bitcoin still at 34k ,4,0
Techlead really believes BTC will drop to 18K  Lets see if this ages well  XD,82,34
 Mr Egusi that logic makes no sense  People buy bitcoin because they hate dollar  Making dollar a digital money won t change anything and they will keep printing it with nothing to back it up just like paper dollar ,2,
 W K Could care less about random assumptions  Your ramblings are just as laughable as Techlead s TA  It will never go 18K  It s wishful thinking on your part  Thanks to other worthless comments here just like yours  any good discussion about realistic price movements and predictions will only be buried under noise  Can I assume they re all just you ,2,
 SCUD what you describe is the entire reason bitcoin was created  It will survive  Value may drop for a while  but it will survive ,2,
Tech  Schiff  Lead ,1,
 SCUD I always ask people who think Bitcoin will replace the USD   how many Ohio Class Nuclear Submarines does BTC have  The world is not ruled by memes it s ruled by power ,1,
12 15k BTC is quite realistic  I m tired of  positivity porn  in crypto ,5,
 Forau DNB It doesn t matter if you care or not im stating a FACT  when these Central banks are ready with their own Government Controlled digital currency they will either outlaw or regulate TF out of BTC Crypto  If you think the people in control of the central banks are going to allow BTC Crypto to compete with what they have been doing for centuries then you don t know how this all works These are the people that had Gaddafi killed over him wanting to start his own central bank before him it was Saddam killed and Iraq invaded because Sadam wanted to start his own central bank these people have started and funded both world wars over monetary reasons and after each war Central banks were installed ,1,
It will drop below 18K lol  Were you around for 2017 2018 ,2,
 SCUD who cares about a state digital currency which inherits all the problems with the original   ,1,
Anyone actually hold crypto and not aware of what the powers that be have planned and already announced  deserve whats coming  Crypto is going bye bye bois it will be irrelevant by 2025 Every country with a central bank has already announced their own Government controlled digital currency Imagine thinking they will allow BTC Real Crypto to stick around lol,2,
the price is being setup for the major players to finally get in  major banks are not going to let themselves get ripped off by buying in at 65k they will shake out all the sissy hand retailers first  and then get in to claim  genius investment ,3,

Just wait until Bitcoin reaches 100k and 1 mill  Tech lead is going to be really quiet about crypto ,3,2
That s his payoff after spreading FUD ,1,
Techlead will make a video in 6 months talking about how he bought this dip and became a multi millionaire,5,2
No  he won t  he will most likely continue to spread FUD among his followers to keep buying the dips  then become a multi millionaire  and then repeat ,2,
How desperate are you for money to resort to these kind of videos where you make a fool of yourself  No knowledge whatsoever ,2,1
Pretty desperate ,1,
Good stuff tech Lead ignore everyone who is negative this is simply a being realistic and giving realistic expectations for the short term  People just want to hear BULL RUN BULL RUN BULL RUN BITCOIN TO A MILLION  In other words we have a bunch of gamblers not knowing that what they are doing is no different than going to a casino a placing a bet  Most people got bought BTC as it was going up trying to flip a quick buck  Ive been trading this market for years now and THE ONLY WAY to make money is to  If you never lock in your profits or at least scale out then this market will toss you around and milk your tits dry   Only way to make money in crypto  1  Go back in time and buy up all the crypto when everyone was in fear  2  Sell if your in profit   TAKE PROFITS  3  Long and short Crypto currencies depending on where BTC is going   4  Stake  Mine  loan  liquidity pools    ETC   ,1,0

 Jesus is God Well  most people are kind of stupid you know    Sell the dip and buy the top   ,1,
the problem is  that bitcoin has no intrinsic value,1,
 True I wonder how people even have money if they sell everytime the investment drops ,1,
No  Also  do people think we are going to be in a bull market forever and the price will not drop to these levels again  Not that we re in a bear market just yet  it s too early to determine that  but I wonder what goes through peoples minds sometimes   ,3,

Volatility is the desired environment,2,4
 BoiledRopeLampPosts  so what is bitcoin then   a commodity   Commodities have an end use  independent of their use in day trading  so it can t be a commodity   So bitcoin is precisely nothing ,1,
volatility contraindicates store of value or medium of exchange ,1,
TechLead is making the argument that the Bitcoin is a currency  missing the point   its an asset  A long time investment with the potential big return  not a digital dollar competition ,5,1
It will go back up eventually  but forever with bullies running the show with a market cap of only 1 5 trillion  Started selling when it hit the 60 s to buy precious metals  Crypto people scorn the metals  Not enough adrenaline I guess ,1,0

he totally misses the point    BTC isn t trying to be a  currency   It s trying to be the ultimate form of SoV  Store of Value  like gold ,4,6
 Moon Striker as with all things  a certain amount of maturation period is needed  The question is does something hold the potential to evolve into a mature product market  To get REALLY simplistic here  a set amount of 21 million bitcoins and periodic halvings is enough to offset a LOT of the issues that we have with the concept of money and wealth ,1,
 name The teenieweenie problem is that btc has been around for more than decade now  and instead of establishing itself more and more as a currency and or store of value it established itself more and more as a pure speculation vehicle  It s heading the opposite direction ,1,
 Secret person D SoV is long term    sigh    You have to zoom out from the daily  weekly  monthly to the quarterly and yearly  Yes it won t be used as  currency   at least for now  because it s too volatile  But the technological potential that it has for a new way of SoV is it s true value  Limited to 21 million  and periodic halvings ,2,
Store of value that loosing 40k in a month lol,5,
Feel that this downturn will only last till EOD or Midnight or way before   I feel we are really only hours away from a big turn around   It s all ready at  and being choked by the whales sos to try  and gain more power over the market   They will loose once the paper hands feel all wet dropping their position and the buyers will be flooding in on news and volume   As you are watching the charts  you will be there to enjoy the reversal   New next or early this week will bring it back to around  50 to  60 but could rally if Elon opens his be fat twitter again ,1,0

 True Lol did you even read what I wrote  Crypto may be the future  but that doesn t mean Bitcoin is the future  Or that is isn t the future  What matters is market sentiment  If money comes flooding back into bitcoin  I will absolutely buy  But right now money is flooding OUT of bitcoin with no bottom in sight  Not the time to buy especially with sentiment the way it is  Pretty much any time if you bought a 52 week high breaking out of a solid base  you made tons of money  Just look at the chart and youll see I m right  I m not talking about pumps BTW  Thats not a solid base ,1,
Just reaccumulate between January and April in 2023  The first four months in the year BEFORE the next halving is like a black friday sale for cryptos ,1,
Speculative cycles are normal  Euphoric blow off and then needs some time to settle down,2,
