Techlead  by not pointing out the cons of this strategy   you are doing a dis service to your fan base  Not the best move  I know you want to tell people about an opportunity you think is likely to work but it is important to show both sides of the coin with a strong warning label before giving this kind of financial advise  Most likely you will be right  but what about the off chance that you are wrong  ,2,

Great video Scott  The wisest thing that should be on everyone s mind currently should be to invest in different streams of income that doesn t depend on the govt  Especially with the current economic crisis around the world  This is still a good time to invest in BTC and digital currencies  BTC ETH        ,1,0

It makes sense   BTC and crypto is off helping to regulate  rather that pretend it won t ever happen   The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere   Most people don t like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize  And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial   Few if any rug pulls   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined  they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space  I d get involved more knowing that I have made over 16  btc from day trade with Jennifer Wilbur Crypto in few weeks ,76,8
As Callum Lucas said  bears being in control of the markets at the moment generates a buy call Price action wise bitcoin has been trading inside a coil pattern of higher lows and lower highs  towards an invisible apex  On the resistance side  the main level to reclaim remains 46K  On the support side  bitcoin now is displaying two main levels 38 33K  A break below the first one  may imply further chances for reaching the target in the south at the swing low  This implies technical projections into either 56k 23k  With Callum s automated s gnalalgos based on unique combinations of trend momentum volume scanners I ve accumulated over Eleven Bitcoin in 10weeks with just One  Employing his S gnal strategies for my trades has been a great experience ,38,6

Collateral loans require a bigger collateral than the loan  even so  if the value of the collateral drops enough  your collateral will be liquidated  Also you can not use your collateral since its locked up as collateral  and it will also not generate any interest since the lender is now the custodial of that asset  and they won t pay interest on the collateral  they will use it to generate roi for themselves  You recommend taking on a loan and keep it until you go to your grave  yet that can be a long time  depending on how long you live many things can happen in that time  a black swan event could cause the value of your asset backing the loan to drop a lot  you ll receive a liquidation notification  or hell even some deflation could happen in your lifetime  Having collateral liquidated means that its gone  Since the collateral was greater than your loan   you are now in a big loss  you have have paid interest for years and you still lost your money  You are recommending a very risky strategy without explaining any of the risks ,20,6
 Lousteau phil they can t  the collateral assets are priced by the markets  and right now the markets aren t doing so well  Its a high risk  they can take your interest and your collateral  you ll be left with less than half of what you wouldve had if you hadn t taken out the loan ,1,

This is high risk  People need to know the dangers of quickly losing all of their money if the market moves against their leveraged positions ,6,3
Yep  people will take this advice and then the market collapses as the fed tightens and they are forced to sell their collateral and get margin called on the loan which they presumably spent ,1,

Remember  when you take a loan out  you have to pay interest   The loan isn t free   The interest has to be factored in ,23,7
Actually depending on the loan  you don t  With some loans as long as your margin requirements are met by your collateral  you can just roll the interest into the loan principle and it s fine  In such cases you effectively never need to repay the debt ,1,

I m of  the opinion that those who leave it to market dynamics to determine when to trade or not are either new to the Market or are probably just na ve  The market has seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders are taking advantage of the dip even more towards trading sessions  My advice to new investors  More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to trade over 8 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just about 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from expert Harney Valfredo,19,3
Trading with an expert like Harney Valfredo is the strategy for newbies and busy investors who have little or no time to monitor trade   I will advise you to stop trading on your own it s very risky  Seek advice from a professional trader   ,2,
Worst idea ever   VERY HIGH RISK  The market crashes slowly  u get margin called  and lose big time      never put the ownership of your assets in the hands of others  Especially right now    ,1,1

Investments has been and will always be the most lucrative business in the world  both NFTs  real estates  stocks and crypto are really positively changing peoples life,39,18
This is conceptually reminiscent of the Financial Crisis of 2008  You see  your strategy may be abstracted to three points  Get a loan with a low interest rate  invest in an inflation hedge  and profit from investment gains minus principal with interest  I find three fundamental flaws with this  Firstly  you need a credit rating score high enough to take out such a loan  which most don t have  Secondly  investing in an inflation hedge may go awry due to uncertainty  Thirdly  diminution in your position will force you to default on your loan  destroying your credit rating  and at scale  potentially collapsing the economy  Your idea is simple and cogent  albeit it presumes too many factors to end up being a certain way  I would exercise great caution before leveraging speculation ,8,2
Works great until the margin calls come around ,8,2
Honestly  not everyone has a million dollars to invest  and most people won t go for loans  Hence  it is important to invest an amount you can afford to lose  I ve been on crypto business for a while now and it s been so profitable for me  Even now  I earn as much as  500 on daily basis which anyone can earn too,24,6

Borrowing is never good  Except if you borrow out and can enforce debt collection on your victims  Only time when you want to borrow is never  Maybe to borrow 15  total capital to start your business   Debt will not make you rich  Buy good assets and hold for next decade  it will lower risk and over longer time it will return your loss in inflation   I liked this channel more as tech channel ,1,1
Please be careful borrowing against your portfolio  IBKR reserves the right to sell your shares the moment you go over your borrowing limit  typically 50    either by your own actions or by market fluctuations  If the market dips  IBKR can force sell when the shares drop in price  locking in a loss and generating a taxable event ,8,1

All inflationary booms eventually lead to business cycle busts where even aapl and googl can crash  It is baked into the cake  When your collateral collapses it is game over  Better but still risky strategy is to buy assets that rise with inflation like copper copx  and metals XME and coal BTU  ARCH and oil like OIH   Then try to get out before the bust comes  Still risky but not as risky as what Tech lead recommends here ,10,0

Flaw in the reasoning TechLead  you take out the loan but you have to produce more collateral if the assets guaranteeing the loan fall in value   So you ve got the loan and then you ve got a margin call  You re assuming stable markets and stable assets values which may be erroneous  Wrong again TechLead ,1,0

It s all in the teory  As far as I know you  you would never take a loan and invest the money  It s a break or make teory  one choice and the rest of your life will depend on it even with low interest  You can do better  what is in your heart right now  what is the true direction we should follow right now  I m not the TechLead  you are ,4,0
Almost guaranteed,1,0
It s free money in the long term under the assumption that inflation stays higher than the interest you re paying  and if you get loans under 3  it s almost guaranteed  The beauty of this is that if interest goes up you can gain on the spread  and if it doesn t you can always close the loan  Of course this whole argument breaks down for margin loans where you have to stay right every day  vs a long term loan where you only have to be right on average,1,

Thank you  When you said this might be your most important video  you might be absolutely right  You and Andrei basically did a Robert Kiyosaki move  and explained it much more concisely than Kiyosaki does  Andrei s video was more of a direct  Rich Dad  approach and yours was the expanded edition  Awesome and important video   ,2,0

  I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Hudson Owen  ,53,8
sounds nice   but taking over 50  margin on your stocks can result in liquidation on a flash crash and you lose everything  Not worth the risk imo  i d rather take only 10 25  margin loan max ,10,2
I really enjoy each new video   packed with information  You previously mentioned one income stream as arbitrage  Would you be so kind as to make a video on arbitrage   manual automatic  flash loans or not  different type of arbitrage  Looking forward to your insights ,3,0

This is a strategy that I ve been mulling over for some time for retirement  Still trying to work out the kinks  But yes  the aim isn t to have a liquidation event  dividends can keep accruing and if the retirement balance is large enough and annual expenses small enough  especially if a home is paid off in retirement   perhaps dividends could cover those expenses and interest  But if managed well  this is something I could potentially pass down to the next generation  Still thinking things through,1,0
is amazing how he became a crypto youtuber  from being ex tech lead,1,1
if you take  750K loan on  1M investment  any small drop in stock will get your portfolio liquidated   you should explain margin calls to people  you made it sound trivial thing,17,3
 Issam Mashal I don t understand the risk or much or what was talked about here  but I know for sure I m not taking out a million dollar loan to try to make more money ,2,
 MonkeyBanter what you mentioned is simply incorrect  one volatile day will liquidate your account   check margin maintenance requirements before taking any margin  loan  also if you have highly concentrated stock in your portfolio   margins maintenance will get higher  doesn t matter aapl or voo     I just hope people understand margin loan risks because volatitly is raising in the market,3,
This is why he said buy apple or a vanguard etf essentially lowering your chances of liquidation to zero,1,

So your really taking about opening a margin account with IB and trading on leverage with 1  loan cost   ,5,1
Margin is great as long as the investments are going up in value   when the investments go down  you can get what is called a  Margin Call  which is a forced sale of your investment at the lower price AND a complete pay back of all the money borrowed   causing you to lose most of your money in the process   NO FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION OR DUTY EXISTS  OR IS CREATED  BY VIRTUE OF YOUR RECEIPT OF THIS POSTING  THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE   NO SPECIFIC OUTCOME OR PROFIT IS GUARANTEED ,17,2
Lol thank  It s true what he said  if you keep buying more stocks with your margin  ya lose your money so fast like whaaaa,2,
If you don t borrow you don t get a margin call,1,
