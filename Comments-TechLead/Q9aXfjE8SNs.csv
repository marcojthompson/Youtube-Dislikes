I feel  those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 11 4 BTC when I started at 1 5 BTC in just a few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Mrs  Kathy L Watley  I would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about or hold it and risk losing all  ,133,63

Great video and some nice tips  This is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions  This could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount  Wealth is created during bear markets  not bull markets  If your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk  Let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon  I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 16  btc from day trading with kathleen rife in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,138,11
In all my years of trading and research  the most valuable insight and decision I made was getting in touch with an expert trader  Mr  Alex Valentino and  ever since I started investing with him   I made more profit than ever before  I will recommend him as one of the best trader in the market  feel free to contact him   Orr What sapp 14089060227       ,223,11
 Adam Jerome if i have to rate Alex strategy its going to be 100  i have never seen such profit making before  the best,1,
 Adam Jerome Alex Valentino is one of the best traders I have worked with,1,
 Justus Pauli Investing in crypto with an expert trader is the best way to make profit especially as a beginner who knows little of how crypto really works,2,
 Nikmah islahah probably the best I ve ever came across  I was kinda skeptical at first when I read about him but now I m so impressed,2,
I started investing in January 2020  Now I have seen a decent gain with the COVID 19 with the pandemic  Without Alex Valentino   I would have made the wrong choices with my investments  Also  it would have taken a lot of time and research to select the best investment plans  Their response is very quick ,1,
Thank you for your analysis  You shared an interesting idea zooming out the chart but do you think that the fundamentals and trends on the global financial market will make this scenario come true  If FED increases the interest rate the forecast for BTC is not so positive  unfortunately  I am curious about your thoughts on this topic ,1,0

 Great info and insight as always It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC  A lot has changed and that s on everything but the truth is I don t even care much about bullish or bearish market anymore because Gabriel Alberto got me covered as I have made over 32btc from nov till date  His trading skills are exceptional  ,48,6

Making at least  25k passive income in a week through the financial market  binary options trade  cryptocurrency and forex trading is not impossible  you can make that amount or even more if you put your interest into trading online  Truth is there are so much money making opportunities online and there is more than enough money to go around for everyone  However you need to know that making money online isn t as easy as it sounds  you need to learn and Invest before you can earn ,15,19

Your analysis on those projects are great and your return projections well aligned when risk is properly managed though from a traders prospective the markets only looking for true demand and it will get it no matter what you think or feel  Looking are what we are faced already many argue that with rate hikes coming and the Fed supposedly rolling off it balance sheet will Bitcoin not continue to suffer  It may well do that and for me that then offers a long term entry point  as I sense the correlation dynamic will change in due time  Now in trading especially for a large portfolio  s gnal algos which are automated remains the best  Few traders I know use state of the art s gnal algos for their trading activities  My best pick is that of career trader Callum Lucas  his s gnals are based on unique combinations of trend  momentum  volume scanners and onchain analytics in which I ve accumulated over 9 2BTC already  Last week his analysis about the price action of bitcoin hitting 38k target was a hit  I think we all agree that the recent market drawdowns wasn t expected as it lead to cascading liquidations  Automated s gnal algos removes you from the crowd   If interested then reach out at TeLe G  m  callumluc s,63,4

ARK Invest just said that BTC will hit 1M by 2030  What I think you must cover sometime later  it s too early since there haven t even been a whitelist sale yet  is Bonbon Finance  It s crazy because it s actually an Olympus  fork  OHM being down 90   and they say they launch at this time on purpose to prove that they have a fix for the biggest OHM s problem which is the backing per OHM which is simply BS  so there s no real intrinsic value in OHM  Bonbon Finance is very different in the way that they actually do what Maple is doing  except without any VC funds  Undercollateralized lending pools generate interest that is being paid out to stakers IN STABLECOINS  crazy   So that creates a perpetuity which is a measurable intrinsic value  It s really awesome and I m looking forward for your thoughts on this  Have a good one ,217,0

The easiest way of all to earn money from your crypto may be to deposit your funds into a platform that offers you an annual percentage yield  APY  on the money you hold on their platform  This is similar to depositing money into a savings account at a bank that gives you an annual percentage return on what you hold in your bank account,95,13

Most assets this year face strong deflationary forces from the excess of last year  but bitcoin looks poised to come out as a digital global collateral though some still point that with rate hikes coming and the Fed supposedly rolling off it balance sheet will Bitcoin not continue to suffer  It may well do that and for me that then offers a long term entry point  as I sense the correlation dynamic will change in due time  Now in trading especially for a large portfolio  s gnal algos which are automated remains the best  Few traders I know use state of the art s gnal algos for their trading activities  My best pick is that of career trader Callum Lucas  his s gnals are based on unique combinations of trend  momentum  volume scanners and onchain analytics in which I ve accumulated over 9 2BTC already  Last week his analysis about the price action of bitcoin hitting 32k target was a hit  I think we all agree that the recent market drawdowns wasn t expected as it lead to cascading liquidations  Automated s gnal algos removes you from the crowd   If interested then reach out at TeleG  m  callumlucas,54,1

Record high inflation and rate increases could have bitcoin trading below 20K by years end  hopefully below 10k because that means the coins most of us can buy  fantom  ADA  algo  matic  maybe solana  avalance  will be trading at 50 100X potenial gain levels  If not then I ll be a spectator until they do  which will happen this year or in 23  But I figure we ve got 4 years of crypto fun left before the democrats gain a super majority again and regulate it out of relevance  get it while you can,3,0

 I believe that the crypto market has already factored in inflation  These cunning rodents are always two steps ahead of the competition because they are market creators  I m praying I m mistaken and they won t dump it on individual investors like they did in the past  Those that hold on to their profits the longest will reap the greatest rewards  I trade and hold profits  Keep up the excellent work  Craig Zach has also been researching all charts  trades  and methods on BTC  which has lately helped my portfolio grow to 17 BTC,46,6

  I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Hudson Owen ,69,6

 Awesome post I must say   Crypto is moving with little sign of stopping throughout the past few days and weeks   with movements reaching a clear impasse   the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  i appreciate the honesty  the most you tubers this days is only up to the moon  funny part is that nobody is talking or taking in consideration of what s happening around us        stock market   delta variant   inflation and so on  let alone of how bitcoin perform before in the same situation in the past  what s best to do now is to trade with pro treder Daniel as to stack up more even in this period ,1,1

 Anne stewart  Don t listen to her  don t give up  Trading takes time months  even years  to master  even the pros learn everyday  Never the less  if you lose money no matter which side you take  maybe you need to look at how you are managing active trades rather than how you are entering them  My advice  find a mentor   And also  try incorporating the use of oscillators  Bollinger and pivot points into your strategy  And most importantly move to higher TFs 4h or 1D preferably   you ll thank me later   ,1,
