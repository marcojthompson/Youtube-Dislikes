Stop talking to your ex wife  Jeez  It will sour your next relationship  Just let go ,1,
It is spelled as cheap   what she really wanted to say is you are smart ,1,
TechLead became a MGTOW  knowingly or unknowingly ,1,
Yes you are a CPM  Cheap Paranoid Millionaire  who sold all  his bitcoin too early ,1,
Tech lead  no offense to you  but your ex wife is foolish with managing money ,1,
 First name Last name I have posted that message on a lot of videos  People have to understand that the people control the market  And we need to take action against any country trying to manipulate the market  Its not a personal attack on Chinese people  Its an attack against the Chinese government ,1,
Tech Lead  agree with you,2,
 Fred Winslow lol  well  initially there must have been sooomething,1,
 Brittany M are you watching the videos      There is zero compatibility ,1,
I know he has a dry sense of humour and perhaps aspergers but while he is entirely humane and uses common sense that is not common  why doesn t he use his commons sense to find a partner and a few real friends     Or is it that he does have some and his lack of a partner is where his common sense and his grief and practical frustration over his divorce are a problem      I shared this with my adult kids and wife bec what he is covering is accurate and useful to assimilate and live by,1,
 adam g who cares    go away,1,
  Jr Kim He was too busy trying to pick up seeds and dropped the watermelon  The smartest guy in the room traded a house of his own to live with his parents  He traded a job at Facebook to be a sh   talking Youtuber  He traded his marriage to save a few dollars  He traded a life with his son for time on the Play Station  Now he is on some wild Lamborghini analogy  Smartest guy in the room ,2,
Get that woman back Homie    just be easy this time,2,
It s alright to be yourself we re both narcissistic,2,
If the speed limit is 75 mph  then you cannot even enjoy your Lamborghini to its full potential   It s wasted money for all that horsepower  It s inefficient   It s better to spend  500 000 on 10 cars that cost  50 000 each  You can still get a luxury feel with that kind of money  You can give a few to family  and then the rest of the cars can be company cars that employees use ,2,
I agree with Techlead about spending money   It s better to spend money on something that multiple people can enjoy  For example  it s better to spend  1 000 on a new refrigerator that his parents can also use instead of spending  1 000 on a bicycle that only Techlead would use ,4,
C mon techlead stop applying your rationality to female nature  She likes buying stuff because women have that innate biological gatherer nature  Also having money and not spending it is like  not having money at all    ,5,
I d be interested in you talking about what attracted you to your wife initially and vise versa     Would you ever consider reconciling the relationship ,2,
Ty sir   I m doing something similar in my change about woman and your money        ,1,
YOU NEED TO GO TO GYM  once you start feeling the energy you would start doing crazy fun stuff that you are too bottled up to do,3,
Way to cheap   Can t take it with you  ,3,
next video title    im a millionaire  as a millionaire ,4,
There is no amount of money you can make or save that someone else cannot spend  I know a lot of ppl who spend outrageous money on cars that sit in traffic  Lastly  it is ok to spend lavishly on some things like a house in a nice school district that you can amortize over time  If you look at a nice house car as something you pay off over years  you can bring that 500k car to 50k year over ten years  This is fine if you love something so much you will get use out of it for 10 years  A super car is only fun  6 months IMO ,3,
How much you time left  Happy happy happy and then  MAke video about that ,1,
To be honest I don t even think people need cars  so why would they need a Lamborghini ,12,
Techlead is cheap though  His ex wife is right,15,
I don t need a Lamborghini,1,0
all the things this guy says really hit  I was sold on him when he said he is what success looks like,1,0
2  inflation    old days   ,1,0
Thank you for sharing  it was interesting to hear the way you think and your values  Would be great to learn more about this attitude to money  priorities and such lifestyle   This cloth is actual success  I agree  ,1,0
I agree with everything you said in this video but here are my observations   1  Your ex is looking for an old fashioned  provider     living out of hotels ruins this image for her  even though it s the most rational thing to do now 2  Your ex is looking for a different type of guy and is expecting you to become somebody else  which is unrealistic 3  You need to find a different partner and your ex needs to find someone else also 4  Your ex sounds like a  new rich  type of person   the type that needs to show wealth   whereas you seem like you ve head wealth in your family for a while so you don t need to prove anything to anyone ,1,0
As a millionaire you re sense of humor is right up my alley  I always make friends with asians  my first friend in elementary was Chinese  Lol   I guess I m just smart and we relate ,2,0
 Shiny Chamelon so damn true    Marriage is not worth these days bcoz both partners don t like to share stuff    It s rather become a selfish setup,1,
I get the sense that there is another side to this story so hi wife     please respond to this video and guess what  you ll make a shyt load of money and we ll get to hear your side,1,0
she s right  you are too cheap and only concern about turning in a profit ,1,0
McDonald s is a luxury in some countries of Latin America,4,0
This guy s smart with zero wisdom  Lonely vibes ,1,0
I find TL s rants quite funny   are there any outtakes where he cracks up laughing at himself ,1,1
Your wife sounds like she left you when she realised you didn t want to work for x50 years to bring in  500 000 yr for her to spend ,2,1
Never   A car is just a mode of transport  If it s for investment sure buy it   Knowing you will probably never drive it and make money selling it later on   You have your priorities right   never settle  Your integrity is what is of value   not a car ,1,1
I salute you  as a millionaire ,1,1
she is a taker,1,1
Sorry to say it  but  at least in the way your portray her  your ex wife wife seems to be a shallow gold digger  Didn t you see any warning signs before you got married ,1,0
It s very simple and something in the know men have known for thousands of years and simps betas don t seem to fully understand     Stop  Arguing  With  Women    Quite literally a waste of time  You are dealing with a highly emotional and thus irrational creature ,1,0
Marriage is for chumps  And don t get me started on having children ,1,0
 This is the true image of success    Love your channel ,1,0
Yes i guess She s right you sound cheap in every way   ,1,0
He has no friends  No wonder  ,1,0
No  he is not looking for a team  He did not help his wife mom when she needed    fir medical expenses,2,0
Hilarious  He eats at McDonalds       Even being pour as immigrant years ago I would not go there for my own sake,1,0
She is right   ,1,0
there s a lot of  I  and  me  in this explanation   my time is important  I can live out of a suitcase and be fine  I can have McDonald s  I can play video games and do nothing and therefore pay for college for imaginary friends   there s no consideration of another person here  my mindset regarding my wealth is the same as yours  but i d never be salty at another person for not wanting to live such a lifestyle  it s a partnership  failing to compromise and therefore making someone else live that life when perhaps they don t want to isn t fair  in that case  divorce for you  being cheap  is a perfectly normal response  misaligned needs and wants    divorce,3,0
My wife thinks i m too cheap    my gilfriend doesn t ,1,0
why did you marry to your ex wife at first place  It seems like you are sharing totally different value ,2,0
I feel sad for u dude  AS A MILLIONaire,2,0
 The secret of happiness  you see  is not found in seeking more  but in developing the capacity to enjoy less    Socrates,93,3
if you dont have a stable structure to build upon  that is just futile and degrading,1,
that s why she is only an Ex,1,0
btw  your wife made a correct decision to leave you,1,0
I like it,1,0
You look I would say extremely cheap and never spend money on cloths  Most of your clothes are so old and same thing clothes every day  You need to make an appointment with mental doctor Seriously,2,0
I just want to say that my business just starting to make some good money without me having to work many hours  A lot of what you talk about in your videos seems like really good advice and makes total sense to me and the same philosophy and world views I am adapting to as I become more successful  Thanks for taking the time out of your day to share your experiences and knowledge ,8,1
             real,1,0
in times like these  its best to be practical    ive been living Techlead life for years now  without the millions   and i helps me find peace ,3,0
I feel so pity about you when I see that super successful ex Google techlead person among developers eats unhealthy food  cuz he wants to save some extra money  Is it the same problem for most of the Americans to live in  1 developed country and to be not able to afford healthy food ,1,0
this man never fails to amaze me  as a millionaire ,6,0
She met him while he was living it up with lots of money    then he changes into being frugal  and wonders why she leaves ,1,1
I love your channel     so honest and insightful  Very refreshing and youre a great story teller as well ,7,0
When he s not being a troll  this guy talks a hell of a lot of sense ,10,1
Best thing I ve heard in awhile   Would I buy a Lambo for myself or help family who can t afford to eat   Thank you Techlead ,20,0
everytime tech leads lacks content ideas  he calls his ex wife,1,0
I want to empathize with you TechLead  But you are one of those fools that have  or had  a strong impulse to impress people   Hence  you attracted a gold digger  which there are PLENTY of in Japan and nearby  Korea  China  Taiwan    They are practically the culture of gold diggers   You should have kept your wealth hidden  But like a fools you are advertising it even now ,1,0
This is a very SMART man and ABSOLUTELY 100  correct  All of these folks who need material things to make themselves feel as if their lives has value are MORONS    First of all  none of us should have to prove to anyone our worth  this is something our parents instill upon us as children and we reinforce this by the way we live our lives and not depending on how many Lambos and Mansions we own   Brother  I would love to have you as a friend  You and I think very much a like ,1,0
Better to stay single ,1,0
5 10 glad to know millionaires still let their mattress touch the floor like a college freshman   I just got a bed frame myself at 23 ,1,1
 TechLead I m a fan bro   I ve watched just a few and now I m hooked   LMAO   Keep the  REAL  content coming   Love the humor and the realness in the humor ,1,0
My advice  get as far away from Japan as you can   An island full of the unhappiest  shallowest on earth   Run run run   Go live your life   Your son is already lost being raised by a hollow shell   You have to write both of them off   Find a new wife   Start a new family   This is the best advice you will ever get ,11,4
Your advice sounds like that of a generic Lifestyle gurus ,1,
Are you Japanese  I think you re right btw,1,
I understand your viewpoint at the same time I can also see why you can t get along with a partner   ,1,2
You don t become a millionaire by spending all your money ,1,0
I think that s the case  She probably resents him for not sharing that with her or  judging  her for wanting it now when he enjoyed it himself at some point  They just seem to be on different pages ,1,
This is the slow driving guy in the fast lane ,2,0
 you would be broke for 49 years  maybe you d have a Lamborghini tho  cackling,1,0
 If you have to ask  then you can t afford it   Okay noted   ,14,0
My question is   Why would i need such an expensive car   This car is going to make you really think  Is this really what I want ,1,0
Love how you know and realize your worth  Thanks for always keeping it real and honest  It takes a lot of courage to be open about your lessons learned but your wisdom is always appreciated,3,0
I find this video very interesting and valuable  Really eye opening  How I wish I could like this video more than once ,3,0
Dear sir  Thank you ,1,0
You are materially  status wealthy  and wonderfully intelligent but you lack the essence of the Heart and Soul which is WISDOM   So after indulging yourself by enjoying the fruits of your labor you decided to enter the crypto like domain with its wild swings  that is a lasting relationship with this woman from Japan who is selfish uncaring and highly materialistic and shallow  but from what I discern from your videos you too are shallow and spiritually deficient   You should have engaged in a long courtship where you took the time to relate all of the information about yourself that you have divulged to over a million of us in your videos  She should have heard all of the topics that you have shared with us and you should have seriously engaged her in a discussion about what you were feeling  and then you should have listened carefully to her responses about your feelings  when she later stated that she did not want to live and try to establish a relationship with your parents you should have seen the giant obstacles I tell my children that a true and lasting relationship also involves embracing the in laws  there are a number of elements that should have been dealt with before you attempted a deep relationship with her and because you have not sought WISDOM and DISCERNMENT your material success and professional accomplishments are shallow because you have not taken the time to develop your soul and so you remain alone and you use us who listen to your videos as sounding boards  ,1,0
Be you honey  Been living out a suitcase myself for 3 yrs now it has been wonderful  Less is surely more ,6,0
Techlead is smart  which is why he s  cheap ,1,0
Him   I d rather spend money on someone s sons tuition fee   Also him on previous episodes   I don t spend money on others because they won t appreciate it ,35,3
I mean  there s quite a difference here  Most people won t appreciate you giving them    a burger  a guitar  etc  But if you pay for their tuition free    the whole time while they re at Uni and eve after  they ll say  Damn  I wouldn t be here if it wasn t for that guy who paid for my tuition fee   They re guaranteed to appreciate you  And the reason is because unlike a burger or a guitar  you re actually giving them something the will help build their future in a positive way ,2,
This proves my theory  cognitive dissonance can be funny ,1,
Yes  that s how much useless he sees the purchase of a Lamborghini  He d rather give the money away for someone s tuition without any appreciation in return ,10,
He is a jugaad  Monetizing every opportunity of his life ,1,1
May be next time he should contact McDonald s  his clothing company  suitcase and hotel room name to give funds to him   Bcoz he is a brilliant advertiser ,1,
what if wanting an early retirement is selfish and you should have waited few more years,1,0
This guy is hilarious   From a distance  this whole wildly successful You Tube Channel of his may be a spoof  This may be comedy      very good comedy   but comedy none the less ,1,0
 Well in her imagination  you will be working all those years  This made me laugh so hard  techlead   This goes to show the lack of knowledge in financial on your exwife s part and a lot of financial maturity on your part  But burning through 350k in day trading and cutting your BTC and ETH  a lambo would just be peanut ,7,0
Is he okay     Like emotionally is this guy okay   Plus after hearing all these videos about his ex wife    did he not know her before he married her ,2,0
You live in a bubble called  Ex WIFE  ,1,0
This is a level of satire that goes right over people s heads ,5,1
Waz fired f FB   Time is more precious to him Isnt chasing status Waz a millionaire b4 marriage  japan  Spend the interests  dividends of an investment  not the investment itself,1,0
Your ex wife didn t listen to all this  She married that fake guy who was living it up and woke up with you  And your parents ,1,0
This is the most powerful statement I have seen in years on youtube   You really deserve that 1 million subs   My wife divorced me thinking I was too cheap  And she did it shortly afte I lost my mother to cancer and my job    She stole my daughter for 1 year too   Marriage is the worst investment in the West anyways   ,2,0
have to take these videos with a grain of salt  you always have to get the other side of the story  how about some perspective  you are a woman with kids  your husband is possibly in his late 30s early40s  has the money but chooses to save it to a extreme degree that he will only eat maccas on occasions  and live in a tiny apartment  instead of providing you and your kids with a life  30 40 year old but choose to eat maccas to save money when he already has the means to live healthier  what kind of message do you convey to your kids and family  isn t that a bit extreme  not to mention a gold digger or materialistic woman  most woman in general will choose to leave you if you live like that  your wife may not be money savvy  and may be materialistic  but when you have a family and other commitments  and you choose to live like a broke 19 year old college student    yes  you are cheap in that sense   ,1,0
Totally agree  the true success is freedom  ,1,1
Your ex wife doesn t understand the concept of investing   ,1,0
 Im the real deal           ,93,1
Japanese people love to look outwardly rich  I m amazed at how they focus on buying things rather than spending time with each other ,5,1
The best investment is in appreciating assets  maintaining your good health and treasuring your family  You are on the right track  Lambos are not a necessity ,1,0
TechLead  if I may      How long did you date your ex wife before you tied the knot   Asking for the masses    ,1,0
You always complaining   be happy  ,1,0
why do you have to put  as a millionaire  every where,1,0
You like a quintessential of tipical toxic IT guy  Dude you made her live with your parents despite her having bad relations with them and her having take care of young child  All this while you have a milions xD that s soo messed up,1,0
From his lifestyle when he met her  it sounds like he set himself up as this flashy guy that would take care of her because he knew that s what she was looking for  Then once he trapped her he became cheap af  and probably catfished her and isn t a millionaire lol,1,1
i think your so full of crap  as a millionare ,1,0
Great points ,1,0
oh god you won my heart by this video   I resonate so much with your thought process and ideas about different things in life   indeed value does not come in price tags surrounding luxury and there is more to have in life than the big money and its pointless expenditure   your personal growth has been great through everything you went through good or bad till now   and I truly think that your wife and you are not really compatible   I don t even understand how the marriage took take place   but anyway I wish you all the best for your life and I hope you get to be with your son as much as possible and he is extremely lucky to have you as a father   as he will grow up   he will realize your love for him and value of your integrity,4,0
He s so cheap he found a way to monetize his divorce drama     ,1,0
Lemme guess  She s with a white guy now ,1,0
Never liked the idea that my gf always thought she was entitled to a lavish lifestyle since I made so much money  Personally  I didn t feel our relationship growing since it was always about money  It was crazy to hear that she felt entitled to part of my net worth when I broke up with her because she  made me the man who I am today  it s ridiculous  I wanted a woman who loved me for me  not a women who feels like she is entitled to my wealth just because she got the position of girlfriend  My take away is that you should always go for women who are ambitions and have a life goal ,4,0
A significant majority of  Men spend their lives building a legacy  Women spend their lives living in the best feel good moment ,1,5
I see why she left you and why you just let her go   ,1,0
He should hire a japanese actress to appear in his video to represent his wife and then give us a sample of the conversations they actually have ,2,0
A happy homeless man I was speaking to told me how he is quite happy to have nothing   He pointed to the crowds in the city and said  most of them have heavy loans  so they actually have negative nothing ,24,0
Her ex sounds vapid and she is the reason a lot of men are going MGTOW   I love women  but not shallow women   If she wants to buy a lambo  she should earn her OWN money to do so  A lot of guys who drive Lambos are usually unattractive and overcompensating or young and naive and don t know the value of money  Your ex doesn t sound too bright and cares far too much what people think of her from the sounds of things,1,0
  And so by going to McDonald s  I saved thousands of dollars       ,149,0
Dude  you should go back to Japan  to some village near Hokkaido and find a simple girl with whom you can restart  Then you should find a job in Japan ,3,0

Plot Twist  He dumped his wife and has been manipulating us for all these years by lying about his relnship and making himself look good ,14,5
Yeah because the stats show 80  of divorces are initiated by the husb   jk it s initiated by the wife 80  of the time     So it would be a plot twist but this is reality and realistically she left him 8 10 times    ,1,

The Fibonacci tool was used to highlight potential target levels for X R P s comeback  A look at its 4 hour chart showed that bulls had cleared the first hurdle in the form of 20 SMA and 23 6  Fibonacci level   0 961   A potential retest of this area could result in some sideways action over the coming hours  Additional areas of interest rested at 38 2  and 50  Fibonacci levels at  1 15 and  1 30  respectively  The initial fib level clashed with 50 SMA on the 4 hour timeframe and 200 SMA on the 1 hour timeframe  Thus   1 15 was of particular significance  A breakout would likely see a steady rise up to  1 30 Momentum was on the bullish side according to Awesome Oscillator as it eyed a move above half line  RSI was slightly less bullish than AO  but a move above 50 was a positive development   This is the better time to pile up on your crypt0 assets  and there are two approaches to increasing your asset as an investor first is by buying little bits of crypt0 subsequently and the second which is a preferred and better option is tradlng because it is less capital intensive and more profitable  I tr de daily with tr de s gnals from Bryant miller and my earnings has increased so much   I can boast of the effectiveness of Mr  Bryant s tr de s gnals and he also have some free courses on google for any tr der trying to set up for proper profitability and he can be reached on               1 253 231 7125  or        bryantmillertrade gmailcom  for further tradlng advice on being profitable ,14,10

It doesnt seem like he understands woman  Im a guy but he doesnt have consideration when it comes to his woman  I know he is all success crazy  but it seems like he changed from who he once was  Thats why she wants to leave because he was a person who lived life and not like now where he is just a depressed millionaire      money isnt everything either  Look at the billionaires recently  People want others who have good experiences and live life so I don t blame her     ,1,0
This dude is a millionaire  I didn t notice,1,0
You are cheap  You maybe wealthy on paper   but your lifestyle is that of someone on social assistance  Sitting in your room stroking your rod and playing video games all day is not a lifestyle anyone should strive for  You mentioned you use to travel   dressed well and you lived a luxurious lifestyle  this is the lifestyle that your wife assumed she was marrying into  instead it sounds like you gave her the bait and switch  Now your wife lives in a home that you pay for and is getting run through by a guy making 30k a year  because her financial needs are being taken care of by you and that just leaves her sexual needs that are being taken care of by someone new  The thing with you young rich guys is that when you get a woman you feel as though you can marry her and park her in the garage like a trophy car  But relationships take maintenance and energy that I don t think you were willing to invest in  I wish I could talk to you directly and school you on some things you ll never find in a text book ,2,0

I collect expensive classic cars because they hold their value and can be sold over my purchase price  I can also monetize them by leasing them to movie studios for film shoots  conventions  and other projects  So I would say the  500k Lambo can be bought when you find a way to invest it into a project that pays itself back ,7,0

 Murray Saucedo same  bought my car and everything I own with cash  Being debt free is the best ,2,
 Classical Music Remixes 432hz no offence but that s because many of those people are idiots  A car is hyper depreciable  I agree with Murray that I would only buy a luxury car if my net worth could support it enough that losing thousands of dollars in car value would mean nothing to me ,1,
 Classical Music Remixes 432hz this is why  most people  are poor lol ,3,
 Murray Saucedo so I m guessing that is a 20k car how much do you earn a year ,1,
 Classical Music Remixes 432hz hence why I said for me personally  I don t have that hence why I don t drive a  500k car  I drive a 2015 RAV4 CPO I bought cash again no debt in my purchase,1,
how do you figure that  how about if you just make 1M a year   most people buy 30k cars and make 50k a year  So thats about the same ratio ,4,

I ve lived at a few income brackets over the years  I think the idea of blowing a heap of money on something like a fancy car is fine  until suddenly you actually have that money to do that  then you find you make different choices  Or  you go on a huge spending spree for a little bit  if I ve been doing it super hard and then get a really good job I find this happens  because there were things I was doing without that genuinely need replacing or updating   but then you ll find yourself naturally evening out  and making choices that ensure a continued flow of that money  I think the car is just dreams  Only people I know to get the fancy cars  was always the upper middle income bracket bogans  The richest people I ve known  just drove a regular Toyota  or if they splashed  it was only like a Renaut  or an Audi  not the super high end   Those were self made people though  maybe it changes with 2nd and 3rd generation rich    Still  I think what she s said is   just the dreams of someone with a lower bank account  They aren t practical  and if it became real  she d likely find herself making similar boring choices as you ,1,0
Your bank account  your choice  I mean it ,1,0
Why the F    would I want to buy a Lamborghini ,1,0
I love your cheapness  I am exactly the same way     this is the true image of success and you need to get that into your head   hahaha  I love that  your wife sounds like insecure about her financial disabilities  people like that love to impress others to hide the fact that they are not financially strong ,5,0

The most fun part is when he says how much he values friendschips  relations and connections with others when he doesnt even have friends XD,572,24

well     i went through many of this but somehow i can understand     easy to get relationship but hard to get the right   true one,2,
rather no friends  than bad friends  It is not easy to find  good  people who are not superficial  toxic or want to take advantage of you  This is a high quality man and he has high requirements for people in terms of character,15,
The higher you ascend  the more rarified the air  the smaller the crowd   ,21,
You value the things that are scarce ,6,
well that doesn t mean he never had friends  people grow apart all the time  friendship can end because either they had to move out to another country   death  etc  not having friend at that age does not mean its his fault or that his a bad person  it can be from situation out of his control ,53,

I ll be your friend Mr TechLead ,1,0
You are good at optimizing things  but you can t optimize people without their consent  which I don t say you do  but the fact you can t means you have to accept that they must change a lot of things by themselves or actually remain the way they are   They have their own mistakes  and they are free to do or say stupid things  In order to live a good life with others you have to a  get surrounded by people like you or b  Accept their mistakes and adapt to them  The main thing is that they must correspond to your principles  and I don t think your Ex does  She seems to care too much about spending money and not that much about the value of the simple things that people can do  In order to find more people that value little things  you have to do more of those  Because it seems like you only have to offer tons of money and productivity  thus you end up with people chasing your money  As a random nonrelated advice  start doing Muay Thai  It s great for people that care too much about productivity but feel anxious about things like the meaning of life  the blame  responsibility and other stuff ,1,0
TechLead  just date another woman and create a new family  that is what you should do  You value children  and you have strong family values  An unsuccessful relationship is not the end of any relationship that you can have in the future  Find a woman who shares your values  especially related to spending money reasonably  irrespective of how much you have or how much you earn  A woman who simply wants children and who also wants to have a family life as her priority  And who understands that  in life  you have to sacrifice in order to succeed  The Japanese woman you were in a relationship with  your ex wife   it did not work only because she did not have the same values than you have  She was Japanese  yes  and that is part of your roots but a Japanese with bad values is not good as you have experienced  And that is not the end of a relationship with a Japanese or with a woman who has Japanese roots  you could simply try to find both Japanese roots and a woman who shares your values and that will work this second time  Your values are the right ones and they are the ones that will last and that will be beneficial long term as opposed to thinking short term like your ex wife  All the best to you  TechLead  TAKE ACTION ON THIS MATTER  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME  AS EVERY YEAR  YOU DO GET ONE YEAR OLDER  ,1,0

I don t think there s any point where buying a 500k Lamborghini makes sense  Wanting to live lavishly is one thing  but I don t see why the rich have a need to be overcharged so much  Get a Tesla Model S Performance for 1 5th the price and twice the acceleration if you want that experience so much  Eventually  buying the more expensive thing yields diminishing returns  or the expensive thing turns out to be even worse ,1,0

This is totally true lol   In the Silicon Valley you see some people wearing very trash clothes chilling in a Palo Alto coffee shop at 11 00 on a Wednesday   Those are the ones who sold their companies for millions billions and don t need to impress anyone   They are the ones who can chill at a coffee shop on a Wednesday because they don t need to work ,505,14
It really depends on lifestyle  I think there is a general culture among tech people to be laid back and care less about appearances or material possessions  However  I have also seen millionaires who do like to enjoy the finer things in life with their money  Especially if a large part of their job requires it or it becomes part of the culture etc  Think hedge fund managers or other millionaires within corporate finance  Or millionaires working on the fashion industry etc  Or just certain millionaires in various industries who enjoy that stuff  How people chose to spend their money I think also comes from some of their value system  It seems the ex wife and him just had a different idea of how they wanted to live their life or spend their money ,2,
The people with champagne tastes aren t usually achievers,1,

that thinking ignores the idea that others still achieve some fragments of self esteem from looking well groomed and fashionable and sets the bar for  success  as  busy  divorced millionaire  bad food  bad clothes ,1,

I m just curious how two people with such different lifestyles ended up together   ,141,25
He should ve chose better ,1,
I actually don t need her side because I can completely understand her   D This men made her live with his parents to save money despise having millions and his parents not liking her and making her miserable all while she was having a very young child  And he courted her with travel and restaurants all that ended after marriage with MacDonald trips  She was fare from home and must have been homesick ,3,
when they met   he used to spend a lot that gave a wrong pic i guess ,2,
 mamneo2 oh jeez  He also has a responsibility to choose someone who has similar values to him  It takes two to tango  No one forced him to marry her or date her    It s both of their faults  they were incompatible and probably blew right through many warning signs   Think of it this way  if you re a dude  it is in your best interest to choose a partner that you will get along with and if you re looking to get married  you have to consider long term  what s the future going to be like  A marriage is literally an investment of your life  time  effort  and money  on the future of your life    Same goes for her   Again  two to tango    Sometimes even if you re compatible  marriages can still fail  But everytime he talks about her it tells me that they were CLEARLY incompatible and never shared the same values but neither of them didn t consider that  You can work through some differences and issue do arise but I don t believe divergent core values are something you can overcome to make a satisfactory marriage  Probably because he was rich and she was pretty  Like she missed living in Japan and being with family  but he s ok living like a nomad being economic driven  That seems small but that s actually a huge difference in lifestyle and VALUES that s gonna get bigger down the road    That s like investing ALL your money in a stock because it s doing good now  but you never looked into it s history or how the business is being ran ,4,
 Thomas Foolery yea  it sounds like they both went for each other for shallow reasons and it turned out once the glitter wore off  they actually have zero values in common ,2,
 Thomas Foolery If she believed that marriage was going to be all courtship  dining  hanging out  etc  Then she was the one that fooled herself ,3,
Goldigger,3,
The bait and switch  I am sure she didn t show her full materialistic ways at first  She was the perfect girlfriend ,2,
Well according to this very video she met him while he led an entirely different lifestyle  The more interesting question is how are early Pat and later Pat the same person ,2,
Unfortunately I get it and don t know how I missed it  My ex said she was along with the mindset until the money really came  I realized the same happened to my dad with my mom ,3,
She got attracted to his money,5,
 Hanson Cogen yes  He did  He got her  so he stopped trying  You could say he bait and switched her by advertising a lifestyle he wasn t planning to consistently provide in the courtship phase in order to lock her in  Then once she was pregnant and married to him  making her live with his in laws while he s a multi millionaire   This is also a tale as old as time  Humans acting selfishly and optimizing for their own self interests  It s like wearing a suit to an interview and saying you love to code 100hrs a week for fun  then slacking off and leaving work early once you get the job  And yes  this is indeed why the divorce rate is so high ,23,
 Thomas Foolery He was   Really  But then he must have stopped pampering her after marriage   Who knows ,1,
 TAK  Sensei Only opposite magnets attract  not people   This is a misnomer  and that s why the divorce rate is high ,18,
 Key Xu he was taking her around the world and eating at top restaurants with her when courting her so you are wrong  There s a difference between spending on yourself and spending on a love interest  He s being so cheap with himself for these very reasons ,36,
 Thomas Foolery i highly doubt he is the type to splurge to impress someone,9,
I m guessing she s really cute and he threw money at her to win her over  The trade of beauty for power  A tale as old as time ,42,
Thats what im saying  Like I don t know even how he never saw any of those signs ,11,

I think ex wife should set up her own Youtube channel so we can hear what she has to say   I ll bet it will get lots of subscribers who want to hear the other side of the story   I ll bet people will sympathize more with her once we find out just how bad Techlead treated her  including subjecting her to living with inlaws  That is the worst torture when a wife cannot be queen of her own castle home   LOL,16,1

Hello Techlead  Your ex wife sounds materialistic and financially illiterate  You may have dodged a bullet  She sounds like the type of person that would blow her money until she s broke  It is weird because many Japanese are frugal  They call it  setsuyaku   pronounced SET SOO YAH KOO   So next time she complains of your frugality  Just tell her  setsuyaku  and see how she reacts ,1,0
Sounds like your ex wife married the person you were when you met   the globe hopping millionaire   rather than the person YOU wanted to become in a marriage ,162,8
Not saying I would do the same as her because those things are not what attract me to a man  But now I can t entirely blame her either  Especially if she saw him living a certain way and may have  intentionally or unintentionally  given her the impression that they will both be living life that way going forward  She may resent him now for not sharing that joy on her  Obviously he liked it and treated himself to that lifestyle at some point but now won t do it for his wife  That may be what s going on through her head  She may be financially illiterate  a gold digger or whatever people want to call her  But he did seem to be someone else at the start of their marriage and she didn t sign up for this new person probably ,4,
The truth here,1,
she was asian  enough said   or white for the matter  they re all the same ,3,
I see  the point  Although we cannot tell because we were not there you know  However  your remaks are very probable   ,1,
You hit it on the mark ,5,

You re not being cheap  You re being smart with your time and money  Clearly she s no where near your level in maturity ,80,9

Listening to this made me realize that there is a side to having a lot of money that is not fun at all    living in hotel rooms  very limited clothing options  always having to worry about mobility  not having people you can see and hang out with  I am an introvert  but there is a thin line between being an introvert and a hermit   strained marital relationships  general boring lifestyle   I agree that success is not about the lambhos and the instagram lifestyle    but I do not think this is my idea of success too    There are just too many things sacrificed for this level of efficiency ,1,0

Man those selections of stock videos made me laugh a lot  the lambo race  the french restaurant  the  high profile  guy   so funny  Totally agree with what you say  At some point there is no need for those luxury things any more or showing off  Most women seem to just want that illusion also because comparing their lives to some illusory image they have in their heads  Just wake up people ,1,2

after I became a developer   I feel I don t want anything particularly in physical life  Maybe only replace PC once few years and a good chair    It is her right to say what she wants  but it is your right to ignore her opinion and be yourself as well   Maybe she fell in love with you because she thought you could give her the life style she described like fancy hotel and cool cars   but found out you are not aligned with her after having a family  she got disappointed and angry  This could also explain why she said you ruined her life   ,1,0

exactly techlead   i why would i have waste my money with luxury while millions are dying outside,1,0
Completely agree with you  a relationship should be a team  and there are more important things in life than luxuries  its better to save it  or expend in sharing time moments with love ones or the satisfaction of making a positive impact by helping others  But people focus on gaining more to spend more on themselves  instead of applying the engineering phrase  K I S S ,1,0

It s so true  real rich people use money to buy extra free time and tangible things come second  Time is the most valuable thing in the world  I ve been around a few millionaires and a few 1  ers most of them drove simple reliable cars  unless they were a car enthusiast  and dressed rather normally  They prefer comfort and convenience over fashion  Except for the watch usually a dead give away  time is money and they usually sport a good time piece  They don t want special treatment and they just don t care about showing off wealth because it makes them a target for assholes and leeches  I mean there are exceptions  everyone is different but it s just from my experience ,2,0

Your ex wife is CRAZY     Why pay more when a  20 000 Honda Civic or Accord already has top notch quality  A Lamborghini doesn t mean it has higher quality  reliability  and safety than a Honda Civic  it just a tool people use to show off their status symbol  that s it  ,1,0

What I don t understand is  you said before you met your wife you were living it up  Then after you met her  you suddenly became frugal  Maybe compromise and meet in the middle somewhere ,8,1
I seem to understand Asian cultures better than you  Many girls from richest Asian countries  like China and Japan  seem to be very spoiled  being materialistic and have expensive taste  They put a high value on material things  make a video about this  I am sure  you get  what I mean  like expensive handbags  clothes  restaurants  make up  travel and so on  Your wife signed up for the guy reading on the beach  sailing and so on   not what you are right now  a frugal minimalist   This is not the life she imagined  She could have got somebody else to spoil her the way she wants  As response  she became unhappy with frugal you and left you  taking the child to Japan  Your parents also upset  possible cutting you off  financially  and not happy with the choice of wife and your decisions and outcome  I k ow exactly what a grandchild means in Asian culture and they are completely left out right now   Now you are stuck in a nightmare  not able to return to California  At the mercy of Japanese authorities and your ex wife s  I do not know the details  but nobody runs away if treated good and properly  Maybe you presented her  a lifestyle while dating  which you dramatically changed after marriage  There are always two sides to a story  especially in divorce  I am sure  your wife could get similar subscribers if she presented her side of the story  And yes afford the lamborghini ,1,0
I think you just need to find a woman who shares your values   There is probably a frugal woman out there who would appreciate your humor and would be be grateful for everything you do for her   Before we got married  my wife ordered some cheap  15 rings for us on Amazon   She didn t mind that I drove a used 2009 Toyota   We cook at home  hate spending money at restaurants   The washer dryer broke and she fixed it   We like to buy stocks and cryptocurrency   Graham Stephan has a frugal girlfriend   They re out there ,1,0

I hope you read this b c I had to get out my laptop instead of my phone to write this  I ve been psychoanalyzing your relationship with your ex wife and trying to figure out why you made so many ignorant decisions I mean this in a honest and kind way  in choosing a spouse  I think I have figured it out now with your stories  You met fell in love in a time where you were flying high living  vacationing  eating  wearing what the top 1  of people would have and do  Your wife matched perfectly with your luxurious lifestyle  Then you came back to your true  cheap  self  her words not mine  after a while  You realized you couldn t sustain this luxury life during your  YOLO  temporary mentality and had to return stop everything including luxury wife  Except  you held onto her past the due date ,35,5
its a good theory  and something to learn  maybe like   stay with people who met you and loved you on your lowest  idk  anyway come on   the ex wife IS the cheap one,1,
Past her expiration date ,2,

I bet the ex wife isn t even saying any of these things ,9,0
A lot of Japanese people share your ex wife s belief that they can use all the money they make  because they believe they ll be able to work at the same company until 65  their salary increasing every year  retiring with a generous lump sum pension  This was true with many in the previous generation  but no longer  I hope these people are watching because they re in for a rude awakening ,1,0
I wanted to say a lot more but to keep it short   sorry I think she s right ,2,0
Are you expecting women  especially the asian  to think logically    And you are of chinese origin  The japanese are racist by nature and they regard both koreans and chinese as inferior to them ,1,0

Who cares what she thinks  she s your EX wife now  Being frugal is a hallmark of the truly wealthy   Many people who APPEAR wealthy  like those sporting a Lamborghini   really can t afford it   And your clothes   Everyone these days wears the same thing   jeans and a t shirt   I saw Kevin Bacon the other day  he was wearing jeans and a t shirt   Jon Bon Jovi is worth about 500 million dollars   he wears jeans and a t shirt   Just be yourself  you re  doing fine ,1,0

I agreed with you   I reached financial independence  became multimillionaire decades ago   I rent  use Uber and just get a rental car if needed   Like you  I can afford all those toys but there are more important things in life than those material things   More power to you ,42,1

poor mindset can t understand the rich mindset until the poor become a millionaire or until this poor girl guy losing everything  in this point  he she will gonna start to listen and start doing what rich people do   so to put it in perspective the poor man doesn t have the knowledge and experience with money like the rich people and that s why most of these poor people judge rich people why they didn t buy Lamborghini why they didn t go to the best restaurant why they didn t buy the most things  I will tell why   because he doesn t need it  I will tell you again  because he doesn t need it   he is very happy with the things that make him happy also the foods and traveling and buying more stuff it s become normal to rich people because he experiences this stuff before and now he doesn t need it  all rich people know this but poor people they don t know this fact  all the stuff of what tech lead say here it s true and if you don t believe that tell us your opinion when you become a millionaire,1,0
Women by design and biology are driven by emotions not by rationale  Did you know that most western women only like the idea of being married and wearing a nice ring but they hate the responsibility and chores a housewife must do  But dont hate them for that its their nature  Our nature as men is more like being direct and rational and yes even aggressive to get things done ,1,0

I agree with you 95   You have am understanding of finance and the lifetime timeline that she doesn t    Yes  I think you could spend just a bit more  I would   Meaning  I enjoy good quality food so I would probably go to eat well  or cook myself  And that s not for the sake of spending  it showing off  but because I really take joy in it and eating well is also a priority  Same with clothes  I would have a bit more  but I am a woman  I am not a minimalist  have more of everything  But I do understand where you re coming from    Personally  I am all for buying nice stuff   but relative to your income flow  So if money is just flowing in  and will in the future  and I would be dreaming of a Lambo for a long time  then I might go for it  In all other cases  no  I don t see any sense in buying stuff that you can hardly afford  or where you need to start saving on food to get it   That s no fun  Even for traveling  if I need to have lower than usual standard on a vacation  just because the destination is so expensive  e g  need to camp and cook spaghetti just to be there   then I d rather stay home and enjoy ice cream on my balcony    The young generation  and by that I mean her and not you  seems to frequently be  1 quite brainwashed into the  necessity  of a luxurious lifestyle and spending  2  Prioritizing enjoyment over everything else  like enjoying is the sense of life   3  Out of touch with reality in some sense    Isn t it remarkable how she has a good plan of how to spend it all  while at the same time having a plan how you d be working for another 50 years    Seems she d be the only one enjoying  it   while you d be making  it    Great plan  except that she didn t concern you in the calculation   And quite selfish  i may say     If she d earn it  she d know it was not that easy to do so  so she wouldn t be just throwing it out the window so much    I d say renting something for a period  as opposed to owning would make some sense   The Lambo    McDonalds  junk on one hand  not all   overpriced on the other hand  I would prefer any genuine local food to it    But we are all different  I say everyone is entitled to spend their own money the way they want ,2,0

Message to the ex wife  before judging someone as  cheap  I d recommend becoming educated on finance and investing  aka how to stay rich  Btw  buying an expensive car is one of the most immature way of spending money  Maybe you also need to learn about what life really is about  Hint  it s not about shiny luxury items ,33,1

Hey man    Go to Ukraine    find a young good wife who s beautiful and respectful    It s devastating watching a multimillionaire not happy about anything ,1,1
I understand being modest  and a person should be  but you both should have experienced some of the nicer things in life together from time to time  I believe that could have been afforded and builds great bonding memories  Being married  y all should have owned a house to  a double at the absolute least  the value of houses just go up over time  Being single is a different story  be as cheap as you want  I would  and I would certainly travel and spend a ton of time working on businesses ,3,1

I think your ex wife married  you for your money   Maybe when you were dating her  you were living in fancy hotel rooms and living it up  so she wanted to share your  lifestyle    Then after you two got married  she found out you only  like to eat at McDonalds  not fancy restaurants  which I m guessing she prefers  and live in cheap hotel rooms   So the lesson here is  never pretend to be someone  you are not when you propose to someone   Otherwise it will end badly ,18,4
 fewoozone dear gawd  mister  I am a 50F and promise you that most men my age are falling apart   it is 2 3rds of the population who are overweight  so obviously that must include a large percentage of men as well    You left out that many wives will stay no matter what type of crap her husband pulls   My grandfather cheated on his wife many times  but she refused to leave   Same thing with my dad s current wife   Some women are afraid they ll be blamed for the divorce and so look bad in the eyes of society   some people  men inlcuded  simply cannot stand to live alone ,1,
 Kiryu Kazuma The problem with bragging about keeping wives is that we don t know what they look like  We don t know what your wife or Patrick s wife looks like   Are they pretty and worth making an effort to keep or ugly like Melinda Gates  We all know many wives  let it go  in terms of looks  get fat or ugly or old  soon after marriage  like Pearce Brosnan s wife  which is why divorce rates are sky high   Some men just don t want to freak waking up to look at their wives without makeup   So not all  wives  are equal ,1,

I left a comment on a Jeffree Star YouTube video where he was revealing a mansion He had bought I think in California  my comment was that even if I could afford to buy a mansion like his I still would not do it  maintenance alone would be ridiculous to pay  Someone claps back and said that I was thinking like a poor person because Jeffree Star make so much money that his money makes money  and yes thats possible but still  why would you buy that   I would need to have a very deeply embedded complex  a need for validation from other people to buy a Lamborghini and a mansion  ,1,0
 I would love if your ex wife respond here in the comments ,1,0

It takes more self discipline to be  cheap  than  expensive  but sadly  most people don t see it that way ,236,7
I disagree   If you re born poor and then became rich  then it would need courage to spend money for the rest of your life ,3,
People view different things valuable no matter what you cannot make people see what you value as valuable to them  which is why you must really make sure your partner and you are on the same page before getting married ,5,

Clearly  your definition of an  ex  is totally different from mine  If I had a child  I d only communicate with them about the child  Other than that  there d be no reason for us to speak to each other  especially not conversations about what I should do with money that I earned   lol They re  exes  for a reason   ,25,2

It s basically based off of the idea of living off of the interest and never touching the principle  You might look up  financial independence  to understand the concept of never running out of money and really  always having your wealth build   That comes out to traditionally 5 8  based on your investment return  which in this video I explain why it is over optimistic ,1,

Question for the TechLead  What attracted you to your ex wife in the first place  Was she just unbelievably hot  It seems like y all have nothing in common  Thanks for the videos ,6,1
A lot of people are rich because they re cheap ,1,0
Tech your ex just used you and never loved you  she just wanted the status  Stop listening to her,40,2
Used  how would you feel if your husband buys  3k  worth of equipment and for your birthday buys you something for  20  to me it ll say she s not  worth the investment   And she chose to leave him  if she was using then why would she just leave ,5,

TeachLead is not getting value in return for that meal he invited his wife at McDonald s  Not feeling respected and admired in return  I totally understand ,1,
 Chui Fong Tam But most Asians think McDonalds is junk food   Occasional junk food is okay  but not every day  So I can understand why exwife hates McDonalds ,4,
 TechLead I agree  Beggars can t be choosers ,6,
 TechLead you re genius   You re the man ,8,
Mac Donald it s junk food ,6,
McDonalds is yummy,5,
 TechLead Even if you are not going to spend money it s reasonable from a spouse  Or basically anyone who cares about you ,8,
Look  If I m going to spend money  I don t want someone giving me a dirty look about it and telling me I m cheap ,319,

The ex wife sounds like an ESFP or ESTP  Some incompatibility there  ESPs are very into spending as a whole because they live in the moment  They don t really plan for the future,1,13
 asdrubale bisanzio NJ women are very rare  Looking at a 2 or 3 percent of the population in total  He probably didn t meet many of them  ESFP women are everywhere  It s not really his fault that the marriage failed ,1,
 asdrubale bisanzio that s fair  Just know Patrick is very very intelligent ,1,
 TechLead yeah  I figured the same  Based on your descriptions about her  If you are INTP  which I think you are  romance is not going to be easy  It s even harder for INTJs   Everyone wants to be INTJ until they actually become one  It s not glamorous as it seems   But INTPs are pretty compatible with NJs  ENTJ INTJ ENFJ INFJ in general  N types go with N types  They are all future thinkers  My ESFP mom is the same when it comes to materialism and instant gratification  always wanting to spend as much as possible   All SPs have that tendency  but it s the most extreme with ESFP and ESTP  compared to ISTP and ISFP ,1,
Everyone wants to be INTJ  but I d say she s my complete opposite    ESFP ,1,

I m a multi millionaire roughly  10mil net worth and  7mil in investments I got 2 cars a 2019 911 Targa worth   150k and 2011 Cayenne worth  10 20k friends always ask why I don t get a 911 speedster or a  500k car and I say simply I can t afford it  Everytime I try to justify even buying a  200k car the numbers never quite work out  I think ppl have a misunderstanding of how finances work and it s very easy to go broke even while being a millionaire  I m young rn I don t want to spend every dollar I have because I have to give that money to my future children eventually it s called generational wealth and it ll give them a chance at a good life ,1,0
I find your wife s lack of foresight     disturbing   ,1,0

Lesson learned for today  Being an influencer with a youtube channel pays dividends  especially when you want to vent and make you voice heard  maybe even teach other males to avoid marriage  I like you  Tech Lead ,4,1

I met a millionaire once  I worked at a fast food place and he would come in every Wednesday and oder the same meal every time  He dressed in threadbare clothing and that had some holes in them   To look at him you would near think he was rich    Once he told me that he was rich because he did not spend money he didn t have to and adhered to a strict budget  Shortly after that he died and left  25 000 to one of the older ladies in the store whom he enjoyed bantering with when he came in ,2,0

He cannot afford a housewife  and she refused to be a  houseslave ,5,
If she becomes a good housewife like techlead would want  she does deserve that right  Maybe a Lamborghini  but at least some luxuries ,1,

A car is just transportation anyway  vastly overspending on a supercar is pretty pointless unless you re that desperate for attention or you re just so filthy rich that it s not much money for you  When I buy something nice I tend to stop caring about it not long after that  unless it s something like a computer that I use often  and just like a car s purpose is to be safe and efficient at transportation with minimal maintenance problems  a computer is something I ll only buy to be up to speed and reliable so I can efficiently use the net  play games  etc ,1,

But isn t this a scarcity mindset  It seems you are pessimistic about your future earning potential  Therefore  you are trying to hold on to gains acquired from past fruitful periods  If you believed the future would carry on the same trajectory as the past  you may have decided to adopt a slightly different strategy from the current one ,7,0
And why did you marry her  She doesn t like match at all   ,1,0
Your ex shamed you into spending more on her  She married you so you could provide  When you didn t fund her she got out because it s easier to enforce alimony than to daily beg for cash  The problem now is you just advertised yourself as a frugal penny pincher  No woman wants to date Ebenezer Scrooge  It s a big turn off  So as a millionaire you now have killed all interest ,2,1
maybe you can just buy woman,1,
Do you know that inflation is not really 2 3  at all  it s more like 15  per year or higher now since COVID  Inflation should be measured by the increase in Fed balance sheet  not the figure they make up  And getting 15 20  annual returns from stock market is not that hard  My rule is that I can spend 10  of the profits I make annually as a multimillionaire  I reinvest the 90   of the retained earnings for long term compounding  It works really well ,1,0
Reality is that your way of thinking allowed you to earn and keep the money  while common person would never be able to keep the money  just look at what happens to all lotto winners  majority of them end up homeless in debt within 5 years when money dries up  To support her dream lifestyle she just doesn t understand it would take 10x more money  I guess she needs a billionaire  not a millionaire ,1,0
You re an INTJ  you re smart enough to know how people are different  maybe to summarize the story you could have said that your ex wife has different values from yours  and talking about how did you make the choice to live together knowing or ignoring these differences could have been more interesting  what is the personality type of your ex wife by the way ,6,0

This explains why he has and makes money and not her  There is nothing wrong with using money sometimes on expensive things  but you have to think  I totally agree that there is nothing more precious than having a partnership where things are built together  Why does it sometimes seem so hard to find it ,9,4
 Ashhar Kausar Perhaps  and perhaps some men still hope that the woman will stay at home  because without one you will not have the other  But even so  it doesn t make sense  because someone taking care of the house and children while the other works  regardless of gender  is still a partnership  is still a life construct  But even this in the form of a partnership is difficult to find,1,
Much respect for what you re trying to do for your son  Maybe it s better to accept his mother for who she instead of trying to convince her one way or another  Sometimes in life  you have to choose between being right and being happy   I think if either one of you accepts the other it will be much easier to deal with each other and unfortunately  you can only control yourself ,7,0

man don t pay attention to your ex wife at all I was married for ten years and after ten years she went with someone else  she thought it was a better opportunity  so it turned out not so  usually people who lived in total poverty have that sick appetite for  luxury and jewelry expensive cars  these are complexes from early childhood  these people are eager for everything they are always a little not enough no matter how much it is  so do not pay attention to the woman  I have no children whether it is luck or not  I was lucky that I didn t have children with her       so focus on the child  think about him and the ex wife is simply an ex wife that says it all      the problem is that years and years have to pass for you to  mentally reached his birth child as a father  it is a very broad topic      ,2,0

How many times do people with a bunch of expensive crap get their items reposed to pay of loans debts e t c or have to sell off luxury items for less than half the buying price as a act of desperation  She acts if there have never been millionaires who have lost all their wealth  Often if people don t have to work for money they don t understand the value of it   the time  effort   sacrifice it takes to make it  Like people who work overtime in crappy jobs just to spend all of their money on multiple holidays a year or for Christmas deciding to live pay check to pay check on purpose   A little restraint goes a long way ,1,0

Since McDonalds tend to add sugar to every meal   maybe for the sake of your own physical health  avoiding diabetes and some other conditions   you should try eating fruits and veggies for Breakfast and try to prepare your own food   I understand you are thinking on the practicality of buying pre made food but take care of your health as well because if you don t   you are gonna be the only one dealing with health problems in the future  as a Millionaire  ,1,0

exactly what i was think everyone has an opinon on how to spend money but very few know how to make it,13,
Techlead  I agree with most of your spending habits  Living below your means  spending on experiences  looking at the full picture etc  All of that is great but the one thing I disagree with is having breakfast at a fucking McDonald s to save money  If it is once in a while that is fine but your health should be your top priority  Otherwise it would be counterproductive as not spending on your health will cost you a hundred times more in the long run ,1,0
The truth is most likely somewhere in the middle   It s one thing to be frugal but it s another thing to be cheap   You seem to toe the line   Also it s ok to be extremely frugal with the support of your wife   It s another to decide to be cheap af without her input   You really need to be more introspective  as a millionaire  is what I m getting from your videos   You re obviously not over it because you re still bringing up the subject   Sometimes you can t force change on others but you can always improve yourself ,1,1

What if Techlead was really broke and he cant get a really job again  living with his parents because he cant afford a home  wake up people lol,2,1
I have never in my life had any interest in fancy consumer goods of any type ,2,0
Techlead is cheap though  His ex wife is right,5,0
Your ex wife is foolish  if she is extravagant and wasteful  She is no good for you and you deserve a better woman  one without greed  She obviously does not know her maths  if she was expecting you to work for more than 50 years and support her lifestyle ,1,0
If you are a millionaire who spends like a poor man  you are poor in a woman s eyes ,4,0

 Posts another video about Ex wife as if she ll see it ,2,0
I love yours perspective and way of thinking  but what I see as an issue is that you see yours way of thinking as  the right one   As you ve said  you have done trips  you ate in expensive restaurants  you bought that expensive clothes  lived in luxurious apartment for years  Enough to get tired of that and move on to more important things   But as I can see your wife isn t and you are being a bit of hypocrite for thinking she has to think as you do now  after all those experiences   I know you want all the best for your family and all and now you are being financially responsible  but I can imagine it is kinda annoying to be with the person which doesn t want to spoil a bit and enjoy in portion of earned money  but it did earlier  and is thinking about everything as a loss of money  Because if you see world that way  everything is in one way or another loss of money and time  and that  at least for me  is not a way to live  Finding true balance is the key and not going in either extreme of the spectrum   And again  you are great guy and I love your view on many things but these were only my two cents ,2,0
it really bothers women how little we need to be happy,39,4
Women think happiness is found in material goods ,1,
Yeah except for needing a women which can get expensive or keeping you busy ,3,
And why do you care  There is a reason to why you are the self made millionaire and she isn t  You are doing what the other smart rich people do  Keep it up    ,2,1
What was she bringing into the table  Was she wealthy  At least you learned the hard lesson that our physiology can blind us sometimes    ,5,1
The use of stock footage is so good in these you can tell that time and care is put into these videos  One of the few channels I actually like to watch and not just listen to,8,0
Your ex wife can buy a Lamborghini if she starts a YouTube channel responding to these videos ,5608,133
the title would be  why i left techlead the millionaire ,1,
Yes ,1,
If she does  techlead will be ruined,1,
I hope this gets pinned ,1,
She Definitely Watches These   Maybe You Gave Her an Idea  ,1,
I would love to listen to what she says,1,
Stonks,1,
I need her to do this   ,2,
Erm  sorry I shouldn t laugh  I knew it has not been easy  I apologize  ,1,
nice comment  You are a very smart dude  She should reply to these videos ,1,
This guy is still owned by his ex wife  LMAO  Poor guy ,1,
I would travel to her and sell her this idea and manage her channel for a percentage,1,
Exactly,1,
Yeah  if she existed  This guy is obviously putting on a persona show with satire  It is  of course  hilarious  but still a fake persona ,1,
You dropped him a family business idea lol,1,

Ha ha ha    Good one ,1,
HAHHAHHA GOLD,1,

Tay my man  CHOCOLATE RAIN ,2,
If she s able to deliver good content constantly and regularly   Which I doubt  because she d be too busy spending it   ,2,
And she could have a Mother s Day sale on how she makes a million dollars a year off of YouTube course,2,
I wonder if she watches his videos,2,
based  Would 100  sub to her,2,
That all makes sense  but what if you are an investment banker who has to wear suits  stay in NYC London working for good money 12 15 hours a day  Don t you need something to make yourself happy because you don t have the freedom  So you buy a nice car a 3 bedroom apartment to please yourself and make all the effort worth it ,1,0
Would you want your child to watch your youtube videos ,1,0

I always like your videos  as a millionare ,1,0
Here for the tea      Lol  ,1,0
You re the real deal  ,2,0
Honestly if you are a single digit millionaire it doesn t make sense  Networth a few mil is honestly comfortable but not outrageous  He s absolutely right   Also if you are a single male or childless couple a big house doesn t make sense   Also being non extragavant is old money and there is a reason why old money keeps their money   I have helped my friends with money  I have no family   I m starting a business and a goal of mine is too have enough to help my closest friends if they need it  because they have or would do the same for me ,1,0
Well you can always rent out Lamborghini,1,0

I agree with you on money saved by eating at McDonald s  but your health is the most valuable asset you have  In the long run  McDonald s is going to cost you ,42,2

techlead  when are you going to have a title that says  as a billionaire ,6,1
Yes you are    we see you for a long time now to know it ,1,0
Everyone says that they will live luxurious and all but they are just being what they want  Everyone have different kind of dreams in our head  And the way how u spend your money is very inspiring to me and I think I would do the same  I like to save money  It might be useful for later,7,0
You are and will always be cheap as millionaire because you are smart ,2,0

Have wondered this as well ,1,
if an ex reached out to me telling me to buy a lambo  I d change phone number  I don t know the details of their story  but there seems to be an unresolvable conflict of values  so better alone than in bad company,1,
I think you always miss her  don t you   ,1,0
You are Techlead   You are too good for continental breakfast  You need a hotel with a hot buffet breakfast included   Eat two plates so you can skip lunch ,6,0

 My Ex Wife explains how she s a gold digger,16,1
Her plan is how you become poor and work till you die  BUT do try to have some reasonable fun and enjoyment and a few nice outfits here and there  Healthy food too now and again  You have a great plan to retire well and early   Balance is key ,39,3
there s no reason to buy a suit unless you re going somewhere with a dress code really  or if you re in a business environment that it s beneficial,1,
you literally dont know her plan,1,
You spend a lot of time thinking about your ex wife ,2,0
I live by one rule  If I can t keep it after losing my job  injury  cancer  economic collapse  etc  then I can t afford it ,403,17
 Hanson Cogen Watches  sure  especially solid gold ones   cars  No  Aside from business purposes I think buying a brand new car is dumb and financing one is even dumber  Anything you buy that cannot be written off on taxes is just stupid ,1,
 BuckRogers Not a snag at all  A home is a poor investment  Most marriages are also poor investments  But this is the advanced business course most men aren t ready to hear this ,2,
Goes to show that over 80  of Americans don t actually afford many of the things they have,1,
Wisdom,1,
Good advice,1,
 Danilo Novakovi  If you re a properly cheap person that rule doesn t work out so well though  For a long time I was closer to 25 5 70  so I d have to do some pretty crazy spending to bump up that 5 to a 30  I suspect that I d run out of nice things to buy pretty quickly ,1,
I found comfort in the 50 30 20 rule   Example   If I want to buy a  1200 laptop and my  30   were   200   month then I know I would need to not spend money on stuff I want but don t need for around 6 months in order for that laptop to become affordable to me ,4,
great rule to live by,3,
Seems like a fair rule  Also one more reason for me to pull the trigger on some house upgrades I m thinking of  mostly a sauna   After a decade of wageslaving I m kind of at the point where I can afford everything in my life if I were to become unemployed forever  which is a comfy place to be ,11,
good rule ,8,
Yes  you are a millionare    Spend some money  not like crazy but spend enough to show you have money and enjoy yourself    Eat out at nice restaurants  travel in style some and hook up with some expensive call girls ,2,0
Generic comment and like for the YouTube algorithm to be able to work  ,15,0
Thats why shes an ex ahahah  your dry humour never  fails to make me chuckle ,99,1
she a millionaire ex dude  unless if techlead was a  2M millionaire,1,
I agree 100   NEVER judge a book by it s cover  A guy wearing a suit is browsing  A guy wearing shorts and flops is buying  Remember that ,142,10
 Brian Westphal You may have found the flaw ,1,
Isn t the whole point that flip flops is not buying   Unless this is McDonalds ,1,
 GT458 This is true  on average people who do not have a lot of money have this need to blend in  or look rich  Whereas people who are actually wealthy  don t have these needs  they know they are wealthy and there is no need to prove that to anyone  After all  wealthy people have money because they are smart with it ,2,
Only broke people think this is true,1,
and those with less technology on them often are the most wealthy ,1,
that s why goku saves bulma instead of having a proper job It s called investment,1,
This is so true ,1,
Then marry me     ,1,0
those dislikes from your munificient wife s accounts  ,1,0
I looked at the title and thought  She s right  he s cheap  ,2,0
I can see why she is your Ex wife ,1,0
Bro listen    I think I know how you feel about your broken marriage as I have just recovered from one after 3 years of emotional suffering  As much as you like to look tough I think you are still hurting and thats normal  You sound like a good person but mostly marriage breaking is not an individuals fault but 2 people are just very incompatible and divorced was going to happen sooner or later  Wish you move on soon and good luck  Cheers,2,0
This guy has found a way to monetize his therapy sessions ,3018,40
LOOOOL,1,
 radicalNoobSaibot Neither party is wrong  I think it s just him and her having very fundamentally different values over finance  That should be taking in to serious consideration before they marry each other ,1,
Maybe he likes speaking about his thoughts but doesn t have anyone to listen to him  I relate to him a lot I had a similar idea as his  documenting literally everything I think abt and I can talk abt  but I ain t doing it  if people who ik find my vids it ll be weird,2,
And instead of paying for a therapist he reads his YouTube comments       ,2,
Fucking epic   ,2,
Nah  that s just a smoke screen  the real talking points is really being frugal and being smart with Money ,2,
It s lessons learned for those who haven t gotten married yet    lol,1,
 Joseph A i actually dont think hes talking about hix ex wife  its just an excuse for a way more broad topic  this guy is a fkn philosopher,3,

 mike pearson I m a narc too  not a millionaire  so I understand where he s coming from,1,
 mike pearson homie a narc for real    he knows why she left  aint the money ,3,
Therapy is great for people who want to externalize their own failures and lack of experience  character and resilience  Doubly for narcissists  No doubt the end of this sad spiral will be very poorly monetized  if at all ,3,
 Gr8er Than 8   i mean  even just based on his videos you can see that there was a lot of misscommunication on both sides  i think its bad to look at  who is fault  but rather like  what could X have done in that situation   if you start getting to objectively absurd things to  fix  the issue in a certain scenario  thats usually the point where you should think about what to do,2,
 Gr8er Than 8   I also enjoy vulnerability I m a wreck myself,2,
 Joseph A he loves her    shid they are both still in love    too bad the money is the Achilles Heel,3,
Yes  but interesting stuff ,4,
It s beacause he is a millionare ,4,
because therapy costs  1000 hour    200 hour for the therapist ,24,
 Joseph A I like it  A lot of ppl go through this and end up thinking they are the problem ,37,
Why not ,3,
  more men like this fr ,8,
lmao  i was thinking the same  unsubbing because this guy needs to stop talking about his ex wife,48,
Yup he is a genius  as a millionare ,178,
