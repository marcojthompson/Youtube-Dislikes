Hey man  it seems you still have some followers left  May I suggest creating a second coin  You might be able to capture some of their money too  Just a thought ,2,
I don t see a white paper on the website nor an audit  Granted you don t need them but it does provide validity    Although your reputation is on the line if you mess up so one of the few places where those two might not necessarily be mandatory ,3,
Always enjoy your videos  Am hooked  Amazing some people are born so smart ,1,
bro you made me 50k bro that life changing money thank you,7,

 Replied by TechLead get a lawyer with that 400 grand who will claim that narcissism is a mental illness  You should get a reduced sentence  As for the numpties who invested     well the hive has a tendency to defend numpties  But as a narc you would forget that lol    hence the need for a lawyer  dont try to run dude ,1,

Poor fucking fakelead,1,1
I don t know how people don t see though this     TL bashes legit crypto projects but makes his own coin and you people think you are going to the moon     Clearly he is doing this to make a point and show how easy it is to make your own crypto and how  gullible the crypto community has truly become at the prospect of becoming rich overnight  The whale did the smart thing to sell his position  The rest of you will be holding the bag ,1,0
They re all just tryin to make everyone dip out on BTC right now,2,2

Never trust a pencil necked geek who lives at home with him parents   supposable a millionaire  and tries to sell you a crypto he created  Something seriously wrong right there ,4,1
The funniest part is peoples like you still believing that this is some type of troll   Regarding the absurdity of the market well we ve all been seeing all these dog coins doing x10000 in the past few months so TL didnt need to release his own coin to show anything  everybody was already well aware  He is serious about this project ,2,

The ripple comment hurts my heart,2,1
Isn t the wallet concentration of Doge due to most people keeping it in the exchange  not their personal wallets ,1,1
I m still very bullish on MM  I also like how this project is just growing it s own legs among the community   We all have an incentive to make this token successful   TL  we all know you didn t have to start this project at all   Thanks for giving us the opportunity to be a part of something big   I believe MM will be one of the exceptions not the rule when it comes to meme coins ,2,1
From today I am a proud HODLer of 7 777 Milliontoken  waiting to go to the moon  as a millionaire   D,1,1
Great video     Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and a lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now  I d say it s out rightly wrong to just sit back Hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profit should be the way of life that being said  the market is still all BTC at the moment and  I ll advise current investors and newbie to take advantage of the expert Charis Gault program  an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space  to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns  with their program I went from having 1  4btc to 10btc in just 9 weeks  David preston can be reached on  eleqram  Chris Trade11,1,5
It is a great logo,1,1

5 58 Do you want to learn more about crypto  Jump on board  we have a great supportive community  and then you can maybe become a holder too   ,1,1
OK  I have a question now   What is the usability of this project  instead of a risky money investment    Store of value   What will happens when the hype disappear  and a lot small people stay locked inside with 50 80  loss  in investment   Until next whale came in all investments are on hodl ,1,1
Title should look like this   I m poor   as millionaire    ,1,1
I have 25  bitterly sore I didn t buy more the moment I heard about this,1,1

What stops the  whales  selling at a high price then buying straight back in and causing it to pump again    Sorry if it s a silly question but I ll ask anyway,2,1
Anyone still needs a class for Uniswap V3 on how LP works  Well explained TL ,1,0
I want to buy it through trust wallet bit i cant  But why on eth to pay so high fees man  ,1,1

If ETH does bad then this token fails  But ETH is strong so good luck on MM ,1,0
  There s no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull with little sign of stopping  I know people hate saying  this time is different  but the amount of banks  institutions  and companies who have in vested hundreds of millions of dollars with the intent to hold long term  how can we refute that this may be the  super cycle  everyone is talking about  The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen  BTC still has a ways to go in terms of growth  I have been in the crypto world for just over a year now and I have been able to make 30 BTC following the reasonable advise and trade signals from Dennis Berg  a pro analysis that is always one step ahead of other traders  he runs a program for serious minded investor newbies  if you are look for a way to increase your portfolio or investment  Dennis TELEGRAM   dennisberg  ,139,11
All the crypto noobs  please research Impermanent Loss and understand what rug pulls are  Denome has an excellent channel and a video that explains how not to get rekt   Ive been LP farming since day 1  Highy lucrative but it has pitfalls  Uniswap addressed IL with the range feature  I would suggest educating yourself on why it was a necessary implementation ,1,1

I saw this wallet when it was  40 and sold most of my stack thinking this guy will surely unload his bags for  2M profit  Bought the dip at around  4 and pretty glad he s out now  I don t mind whales but it s best to get the paper handed ones out as early as possible,13,1

Bitcoin was up he never talked about it rather talked about million token  now it down boom hes the expert that predicted it   ,1,1
the 400k whale will buy back in on a future dip so don t worry about him,1,1
Given the FAZE CLAN pump and dumb what Techlead did on his channel might be investigated by FTC  I am surprised he s opening himself like that ,1,2
I think we have listings on major cex this week,1,
a guild is what you re talking about   decentralized communities that used to build huge buildings and works of art,2,2
Bitcoin is inflationary  New coins are still coming from thin air mined by miners  It is just less inflationary over time ,1,5
No  it s not  You re misinformed  Read the original Bitcoin paper to understand the economics behind it  You have no clue what you re talking about ,1,
No the max amount of btc cannot be exceeded    not all btc has been mined,1,
Hi  I m new to this  I looked up XRP and it said there will be 100 billion  ever created so do you think XRP can rise in price to 5 euro this question is for the techlead fans ,8,1
in crypto anything can happen  don t look for any advice  It can rise to 5 euro  or in a year it can be 5 cents ,1,

Can you do a slower tutorial on using metamask  buying Million etc,11,5
I m no expert but so far as I remember this worked for me   1  Download MetaMask or similar wallet  2  Purchase Ether into Meta Mask using ApplePay or similar 3  Go to the Uniswap site listed by TechLead 4  Connect your MetaMask wallet using the  connect wallet  button  It should auto register how much Ether you have in your wallet 5 To purchase MM search for it preferably using the contact address BEWARE there are a number of different coins labelled MM eg the similarly titled 1Million token also labelled MM which has nothing to do with this one 6  Purchase the correct MM 7  Use  custom token  in MetaMask to find your MM tokens in the wallet  again identify with contract address 8  They should show up in your MetaMask wallet  9  NB There is a transaction or gas fee so you need to save some ether for that don t attempt to swap 100  of your ether for MM 10  Relax  as a millionaire ,6,
