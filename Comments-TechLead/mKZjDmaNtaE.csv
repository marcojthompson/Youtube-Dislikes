Ethereum jump to well above  2 250 on Tuesday but failed to continue upwards  Just the opposite  the second largest cryptocurrency lost  200 since then as currently stands at  2 060  Binance Coin   1    Cardano   0 5    Ripple   1 5    Polkadot   2    Bitcoin Cash   1    Litecoin   2    and Solana   1 5   have all marked minor losses as well  Uniswap has dumped the most from the larger cap altcoins with a 3 7  increase  A bit more fluctuations come from the lower  and mid cap altcoins  with Celo  16   and XinFin Network  13   leading with the most gains  In contrast  0x   7 5    UMA   7 5    THETA   7    Maker   7    Telcoin   7    Horizen   6    and Aave   6   have lost the most on a 24 hour scale  Ultimately  the cumulative market capitalization has lost some ground since yesterday and currently sits around  1 350 trillion  trading crypto this days has turn so difficult but thanks to Mr Vincente Sanz  its been so smoth for as i copy trade signals from him  He is an expert trader and finance journalist and some free trading course of his can be gotten at www vincentesanzcom and also via gmail   vicentesanzofficial gmailcom  to be contacted strictly on cryptorelated problems ,3,10

Crypto is on quite up run with little sign of stopping I know  people hate sayinq  this time is different  but the amount of banks institutions and companies who have in vested hundreds of millions of dollars with the intent to hold long term how can we refute that this may be the Super cycle  Everyone is talking about  The conditions of this bill market are unlike anything we have ever seen  Btc still has a ways to go in terms of gro wth I have been in the crypto world for just over a year now and I have been able to make 30 Btc following the reasonable advise and trading  s gnals from  Rose japi  a pro analysis that is always one step ahead of other tradrs she runs a program for serious minded investors newbies who are curious to earn from bit coin regardless of the current price chart  You  can easily get to Rose japi on on Tel  egram Rosejapi,28,21

 china lower the mining only makes the value better     the problem are whales who lost money in stocks bettinf against AMC and now have to cash in,2,1
Love your exposition at the 6 min mark forward  this information should be spreaded further  I m myself guilty of checking the price at least once a day  and why  Because the volatility of the crypto market has given me that false hope of turning a few thousand fiat in a random asset into millions in a matter of days  even if the likelihood is very low  It really isn t that different from playing the Bandit machine  I also think easy access to leverage has given birth to a generation of broke gambling addicts  working crappy jobs to pay their student tuition and loans from their wive s boyfriends in order to trade shiba coins  TA youtubers with referal links to leverage platforms is one of those things that should be regulated ,1,1

     Extremely Point by point video  Bitcoin is on sale  Trade or buy it now  it s never too late   Well I will also say this here  Most people   don t understand the concept of  buying the dip  buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off   when the price rises just has the current markets is down  Holding is great  although trading is far more profit able  I was able to grasp the   knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough  but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyze the   digital market  all that changed when I encountered Ben on this youtube platform   I must confess it was easier to understand with the   assistance of Ben  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing   my funds The market itself Is not stable  don t forget that in 2011  the market dip went from  35 to  2  2013 from  220 to  70 and  from    1000 to  200 at mid 2013  also in 2017 it went from  20 000 to  3000 now in 2021 it went from  64 000 to  39 000  My earnings has   increased from my initial investment  capital which is 2 5      to 11 4     in just 11 weeks and some days  which means I made more than   9 btc in 11 weeks  I have full confidence in his trading abilities   Ben  can be reached on             3 2 3 2 1 8   5 7 6                 Bencryptoexpt    ,9,4

Good points made  but looking at it from a certain perspective when it comes to the  mother of all coins   B  TC    Most newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of Technical analysis with regards to trading  Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market  Essentially  the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movement of an asset    Doing Technical analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish  they loose their investment    I d strongly advise any newbie traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89  trade accuracy  I underwent series of trading loses I d best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Prof Greg darrell   My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me  under his careful guide and his signal service I ve been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1 2 b t c to 7 9 b tc in just 3 weeks  I will advice traders especially newbies and some old hodlers to have orientation of trading before they involve in it  Prof Greg  makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals and strategies  He can be contacted                  Gregdarrell   OR  Gregdarrell06 gmailcom  for inquiries into profitable trading strategy ,56,10

Even though I enjoy watching your videos  since you provide a different perspective on things  I still don t agree with you on the future of crypto  The more I learn about the technology behind blockchain and all the possible use cases around it  the more intrigued and excited I get about the future of this new industry   Crypto is not just meant as currency  which is what the feds are trying to regulate  I don t think Bitcoin or ethereum and many other great blockchains  are going to be trash  I disagree with your assessment and believe that we ll see more and more adoption of blockchain technology  which in turn will push up cryptocurrency prices as well  just like NFTs did a few months ago   We ve just started scratching the surface   and we ve just started in this space   It s really an exciting new industry with exponential potential for innovation and decentralization of everything ,3,2

 You re trash  your portfolio is trash  I can t breath right now  You are my hero   Spot on fundamentals  Keep spitting facts    Based on your technicals and the rapid wind down of mining in China  btc 21 24k as the miners dump their btc on market  Weak altcoin projects may implode on themselves without btc to lean on creating more downward pressure as whole  It all boils down to who wants to carry the btc torch now that China is done with it and clearing a path for their own government crypto,4,0

China is known to manipilate their own currency  and they re doing the same with Bitcoin  First  Chinese government has billions worth of confiscated BTC  China also has most of the Bitcoin network s hash power  Who would be surprised if the CCP built a monster mining facility and their reason for banning their own people from mining  is so they can gain more hashrate dominance for the remaining 2 million or so BTC  What s that going to be worth    Bitcoin in particular died over 400 times only to come back with higher lows and higher highs   End of 2016 we had BTC go from  400 to 19 5k in 2017  A 75  pullback   As usual for over a decade   then forward again   Shutting down miners will only cause Bitcoin to increase in value  as it gradually becomes more scarce  It s similar to the Bitcoin halvining  Mining difficulty increases by 50   miners make 50  less Bitcoin  BTC goes scarce  supply and demand sets in  then after some months a bullrun is triggered  It s why we saw BTC run from 5k to 64k within a year  It was a halving year   As far as money laundering goes  it s not possible to launder money with cryptocurrencies  Every on ramp only sells domestically  so when we buy Ethereum for example  our money goes to the seller  and the seller is only local  We do not buy oversea  otherwise the platform would have to charge more for oversea bank transactions   Cryptocurrency has no geolocation and if you re going to fly out of the country while being accused of money laundering  they simply can take it up with the seller  We do not turn money into cryptocurrency  we exchange it for money  In other words  cryptocurrencies do not remove money from one economy to the next  it s not possible   We hear reports about money laundering with crypto  but it s all nonsense  You nor they can even explain how to launder money  fiat  with crypto and you never will  It s not of the federal reserve   When you re more familiar with the space  maybe in a year or 2 from now  you ll see some noobs saying how Bitcoin is dead  it fell down to 100k  it s over  Like damn  Right now it s 32k  that s better than it was for 99  of it s lifespan as it only hit these prices this year   50  75  pullback  This is nothing new  though to you it is  You ought to realize if you made these videos anytime in the past decade  none of them would have aged well  Cryptocurrency is going to shock the majority  and the majority won t be rich  like the 48 million millionaires in the world  they are a small fraction ,1,0
Your crypto videos have been GREAT   They ve really opened up my eyes   I got out when you started warning people about bitcoin   Instead of loosing money I was able to make 5k instead  which is a lot of money for me    Thanks again for the vids   ,2,0

I really liked your video  particularly at the end when you said   don t worry you are always going to miss out   you had me rolling with laughter with that one  My son and I have a continuing running statement about our non luck  We looked at each other when Dogecoin was making headway and said let s invest and see how long before it falls  Took only a few weeks and it crashed down  then after we sold  it moved up to new heights  so we bought some lite coin and eutherum  and a little Bitcoin  and whalla  here we are today crashing  Our joke is  people who wish to invest  should pay us to find out what we invest in  That way they know what not to buy ,12,1

Your sarcasm is awesome    keep up the good work  lol  Oh but one thing to consider    tax return money is very very late this year  When it comes in  guess where it s gonna go  Is there a way you can put that in your 200 day average calculations  I d go with 50 day at this point  Just a suggestion  But then again  I don t know much except I sold my 20 000 sh AMC stock 2 weeks ago at  70 sh  I bought it all last April at  1 90 sh  and waited  Fun in the sun  bro ,1,0
it can still go to 100k this year  this is the last guy to listen for crypto advice  just watch his past videos ,3,1
I think about crypto as a better version of the lottery because you can actually make a profit from it unlike the lottery but that profit will keep on going down then up then down again  So yes you can make some money from crypto but its gonna take a seriously long time before you make some good profit    ,1,0

My understanding of stable coin is that instead of selling back to tether  you sell it to someone else on the exchange  So Tether never needs to reimburse anybody for it  all it needs to do is to have assets for the Dollars it received  People will just sell the USDT to someone else who needs it  So it s not as unsafe as it might seam  but the non transparency is the problem ,1,0

Recovery has been slow for some coins  worse for some others like X R P   June 16 dip had already flipped support level into resistance and the early morning trade only dropped the coin further below  Tradlng at  0 757  X R P could be seen inching closer towards bedrock  0 697  Awesome Oscillator displayed dominating bearish momentum  The purple indicator of Relative Strength Index  RSI  fell into the oversold zone earlier in the day  A small uptick displayed the indicator rising out of the bearish territory in the coming hours  Parabolic SAR also indicated an active downtrend since the white dotted line appeared above the candlesticks   For now  if X R P trades in positive going forward  it could consolidate above  0 73 and prevent any further downfall  I am currently trading under the guidance of Vincente Sanz and with his accurate signal being implemented in my trade I have made 5 B T C from my initial 2 B T C in just an interval of 5 weeks  Investors should have trade experts guiding them in their trade so as to make more profit and Vincente  is someone I highly recommend and an expert to be mentored by and he has his free courses on google that can help you get started too  He can be reached directly through gma il  vicentesanzofficial gmailcom  and tele gram  vincantesanz  so  trade safe everyone ,2,9

 Sally Mclam You shouldn t invest  more than 10  of your savings in crypto   It s a psychological game  and while the technology is promising whales use it to make mad cash  Swapping to other digital assets offers potential for immense gain with no taxes to pay  which is why they accumulate on alt  decrease the BTC and eth parity  and get a discounted BTC or ETH   They squeeze the market and prices that way  create FOMO  and then sell  letting you hold the bag ,1,
Elizabeth  your heartfelt comment got my attention  Sell now  I say so because this house of cards will still dump another 70  ish  Don t hodl altcoins because only 4 out of the top 20 coins from 2018 ever got back above their ATH in 2018 in this run  Sell now and return in 6 12 months when the worst of the dumps would ve hopefully been over  Returning is important because that s when you will recoup your losses and gain more  Many never return because they lose hope  I am also a new investor like you but the reason I suffered only a 15  loss was because I never trusted the YouTube crypto lords and spent days researching and cross examining opinions from the veterans of 2018  Good luck to you ,1,
Why sell at all  Do you need the money  Just wait  even if it was 50K would you sell  No,1,
You only lose if you sell  As long as you didn t use leverage  you ll be ok this isn t new    look at BTC 2017,1,
Paper hands  Don t invest in crypto then  Choose something safe and get like 7  a year ,1,
 Sally Mclam if you sell out now you re obviously at a big loss  Look at it this way though  Those that bought in 2017 were in pain when they went from 20K to 3K  but if they d waited 4 years then they could ve tripled their money  Time in market is very important  Patience is key  If you have the chance to DCA during a bear market you ll be very happy when the bulls return  Now is not the time to panic sell  You yourself set a 10 year plan  Stick to it ,2,
I m in the same boat  and I have spent all my gunpowder on previous dips  So  I won t look at the charts for a few weeks  Remember  in a few years  we ll look back at this time i hope to see a rise,1,

It s a loss  just not a realized one  We all wish we had sold at  60k and could have bought back lower  but we didn t and are holding and hoping i pray we don t lose all and run into debt ,3,

  one of the best  channel on youtube   my personal opinion is when it relates to crypt0  B tcoin is getting interesting and unpredictable every day by day  Alt  Xrp  Link  doge are still lucrative in the market  In this case  the Majority are finding it difficult on which coin to HODL better  I m currently a HODler but still  I m using a working system that provides me 80  correct signal which helps me increases my portfolio  now I bother less about the speculation of the market   I m still winning by applying the same method in every trad e  you can also become a winner today  BTC is the future doesn t mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effect it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price  Most newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of Technical analysis with regards to trading  Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market   so to be on a safer side i advise that we all follow a less talked about way  which is trad ng  I have been able to generate 13 2b tc with my initial 3 5 Y all in search of a profitable system can easily get to Garrick on           garrickfx      ,1,0

 Kuroganemk2 you re very short sighted and trying to trade a volatile market  my guess is you can t trade successfully because 98  of people can t trade successfully over a extended period of time  everything you say thats negative about BTC you could have said 10 years ago 5 years ago 2 years ago or last year yet if you bought it anytime any time other then this year and just held it you would have made really good returns  my guess is you don t know a whole lot about bitcoin you just listen to what the news and people on YouTube tell you  I would recommend you to do some research about BTC the bitcoin halving and block chain in general after you have done that and done some research monetary policy since mid 2000 s to today  when you ve done all that come back and tell me btc is going to  1,2,
 Lancer Evo last bear market it went down 87  off its highs I believe not 99  and we are already down 50   another thing BTC has never done is when it takes out the previous cycle high it never goes below that  if thats the case this time you have a 33  down side and unlimited upside  that sounds like a really good risk vs reward to me  don t listen to haters that make click bait like tech lead he is a fool and is not out to make you money  in fact id say he gets pretty jealous when others do better then he does lol,1,
 Kuroganemk2 if you think BTC could go to  1 thats kinda stupid lol  max supply of 21 million coins with only 18 7m mined so far and only about 2 million coins held on exchanges dictating the price  another thing is I won t need the money if you use your logic you shouldn t invest in anything  You should only invest in money you don t need any time soon  that is true  as for BTC if you look at the big investors that started getting in last year its people that don t plan on selling it anytime soon they put a small percent of there portfolio in BTC and they are holding it for the next 10 plus years  they don t get scared off like little kids ,1,
 BTC Berg that s kind of a stupid way of thinking  you have to sell at some point  Now you are risking your income  while knowing tether is still out there  Think you know by now that bitcoin is just run on emotions  its just gabling just as it can go to 100k it can go to  1  The problem is that when you need the money  the cycle could be going down so its always better to take it out when you have enough to invest into some hard assets like land ,1,
 Kuroganemk2 lets be honest this guy isn t a good investor hes just another YouTuber making click bait to benifit his self,5,
 Kuroganemk2 not me I ll never sell  I bought it well under 10K took it off the exchange and put it in my safety deposit box  I ll look at it in 10 years and see how its doing  When I started buying it just over a year ago everyone said its a stupid idea its going to 0 bla bla bla  it reminds me of today to be honest so with that being said its probably a good time to buy if you don t own any  I d say its more risky not owning it then it is owning some  people get caught up in short term price movments id say just step back and look at it over the long term and then remember what your central bank is doing with their monetary policy  every time things get bad their only solution is to print more money  reward risk and punish people who save dollars    ,2,

 StoneGuy  you re probably right in all honesty  One of the main arguments I hear that is pro crypto is that it s free from central banking government control    But why would I want currency to be outside of government control  That just sounds like it ll be more prone to scams and criminal activity  Plus it always increases the chances of government crackdowns regulation bans   Maybe a government backed run crypto currency could work  but even then I m not really sure why that would be that different to modern day fiat digital currencies ,1,

I have a very different perspective  I only buy during the down years  which means I stopped buying Bitcoin when its price crossed above  14k  then you just hold and watch from that point onward  That s when people should have stopped buying  That s how the bitcoin collectors do it   the people that understand this thing is famous and always will be  so we buy for proportion and rankings  but only when cheaper   Hold your own bitcoin  don t defi it ,1,1

Weird why you only asked where crypto is going in the near term   if you were planning on trading gambling then sure you were right    but if you actually did some research on crypto before you started to  invest  into it you would know that something like BTC which has annualized returns of over 100  also has major drops of 50 80  almost every year  Again in the short term you can carry your clout but let s see if you ll be saying the same stuff 2 3 4 years from now when btc and other cryptos are up big  ,1,1

 i like nice being a millionaire doesnt realy change much despite he  was  successfull in the past  His ethics are flawed non the less  homeless people and kids have better manners then he has,1,
He has no experience  not a clue what he is talking about and always flexing with his money to proof that he is allowed to talk about everything  Guess what he lost a lot of jobs in top positions   for a reason  This guy is beyond arrogant and thinks hes always right  even tho he lives alone without his wife without his kids  his life in reality is completly broken  despite the money    Its one thing being honest  another thing to talk trash and being rude and arrogant is never good,3,
