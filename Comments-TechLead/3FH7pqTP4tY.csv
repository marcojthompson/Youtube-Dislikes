  Learn how I built a  1 000 000  business on YouTube  http   youtubebackstage com ,94,25
im 40 and i could retire tomorrow  and no im not rich  i could move to a small country town buy a little cabin put my savings into high yielding shares and live off the dividends  i have worked it out numerous times  and it would work  should i do it  i hate my job driving a cab  its so stressful and i never have any free times  im always tired im always depressed been doing it for 20yrs  should i just sell up buy a little cabin in the countryside and retire away from humanity  i dont need people around me and things to do  as long as i have a good internet connection i can watch utube vids all day and buy a dog like ive always too but couldnt cos i live in a condo  or should i just keep working another 5 10yrs at least and save even more  so i can have more to live off ,1,
Your level of flex is determined by how many Cybertrucks you own in the future though ,1,
I think doing youtube hasn t intellectually simulated you enough  It would be probably make sense to do youtube and to start a business where you making an impact on world like Elon and not too focused on the money but on the journey itself and hire some employees and boom your back into productive because even I think I would get bored of playing games all day or not working towards something,5,
He s right  I went through it too  Here was my take and I tried it a few times as I posted to my own subscribers  I was a physical therapy contractor and at times still am  But three times I went overseas to exit out of the workforce  Each time was four months  The first few weeks were great  Then I started sleeping later and later  Finally it got to the point where I was going to bed at 3 00 am and getting up at noon  You can only train in the gym so long and see the castles and temples so many times  Even living in Gdansk  Poland on the Baltic beach    you take that walk down the beach   again  And I had no purpose  Even though I was in the beginnings of making my own videos and setting up the channel I still had 7 8 hours of down time a day  And I don t go to clubs and bars so that left a whole lot of idleness  End point  a human feels the best when there is a purpose  I used to work with the elderly and can tell you that they have a lot of depression once their role in life is gone besides that fishing trip   again  I think I ll also have a part time gig whether it is becoming the almighty influencer or being a part time physical therapist  My mental soundness is far better with a role to play than when I was on permanent vacation  Hope that helps someone out there  Charles,7,0
This is the exact same problem I m facing this year and beyond  Staring down the possibility of having to completely re think what to do with my free time now that money isn t an issue  Luckily I ve got a family and lots of hobbies but I can see business money making becoming stale after a while   If AI and robotics truly does eliminate the majority of jobs in my children s lifetime  this is a problem all humans will eventually have to face  It s a tough one ,1,0
I became millionaire and retired but wait here s my my new startup ting,1,1
If I retired early  fat FIRE  I would buy a large plot of land in the countryside  homestead part time  grow my own vegetables and fruit trees  raise some chickens and geese for food and fertliser  buy a horse and keep it at the stables so someone else can take care of it and I ll just visit it to ride exercise the horse  enrol in every class that I never got a chance to do when I was little  including ballet  tai chi  horse riding  etc   study part time at my leisure to earn the degrees I wanted in the first place  art degree in French  Russian  Mandarin    to become an interpreter or translator  statistics and economics because I m a self confessed nerd     I feel like you re already pursuing your interests  Youtube scratches most of your itches for productivity  maintaining an income stream and improving gaining skills  Perhaps next you could work on mindfulness and gratitude so that you can be content with what you have  Of course it s human nature to always want more and strive for more  however hoarding your wealth while living like a miser is hardly a way to live if you cannot enjoy the fruits of your labour without guilt or feeling undeserving of splurging on yourself ,1,0

Tech lead after I retired at 62 and have always been single I later got a little lonely and missed in a way my coworkers I did get my complete million dollars by 63 by investing some of my former 401k At 64 now I still dream sometimes about being at work and it is so real including the color of the rooms and recognizing the people I have the money to take a vacation but I think that it would be lonely I may give it a try though I live in a small town in Tennessee and I have not seen a beach since Tampa s beach in 2005 ,2,0

Hey man  I had a very similar experience as you  joined a startup that became big early and earned a few mils by the age of 30   And I had the same desire to retire and pursue my hobbies  in my case music   And came to very similar realization I won t make it in music professionally and I actually want to code for money again      Somehow watching your video makes me feel much less anxious about my current situation  keep sharing,2,0

That s true  I spent over ten years traveling the world  and I always had this nagging urge to do something more  productive  with my life  my time  Well  I must first admit that many of my friends couldn t take days or weeks off from work to hang out with me  to keep me entertained from all the free time I had  There were days I sat in my home with nothing to do  Dating also became harder because my partner needed to work long hours  so it made me wonder whether I needed to find someone as financially stable as me  Being wealthy is like being out of sync with the rest of the world  We ve been conditioned to always work toward something  and when there s nothing for us to work toward  we can feel a bit uneasy ,1,0

TechLead  unfortunately there s no quick way to say this  You are such a huge inspiration and mentor to me  After discovering your channel I haven t been able to stop coming back  So much wisdom you have taught me  as a software engineer   I wish I had found you sooner  I ve been one of those people way too focused on the technical aspect of the job  always trying to learn everything  always coming up short  always feeling left behind because you simply can t learn at the pace the tech industry is evolving  You have taught me the importance of communication skills and staying focused on what you  need  to know instead of trying to learn everything  I think my work was not completely in vain  because I have learnt to work full stack  able to launch a complete product all by myself  But I wish I had a role model like you in my life earlier  growing up with a mother who s a teacher and a father without a degree I have not had anyone to teach me these skills you need in IT and how the work environment is  You dumb it down with a funny twist and you confirm many of the suspicions I always had with insider information  Like the fact that most people in the industry simply don t understand how to code or how a program works  How the people with the most authority often have no clue what is going on or how the pace of the development is going  they ll be happy to come to work and tell people to work harder as long as they still have a job at the end of the day  Many just talk like they know and know much better than me how to look smart instead of actually putting in the work  I always felt dumb because of that  but I finally understand that I ve just been too humble  I m much more technical and knowledgable than most of my peers because I ve been working with 100  effort every step of the way  but I ve never been taken seriously because I need to train my communication skills and learn to assert my dominance where it counts  I ve made huge progress with these things after absorbing all the information I can from you  Thanks for sharing  I owe you so much  my true and only TechLead   I will continue learning from you  absorbing all your insights and working hard to achieve my goals with a much more focused mind than before ,3,0

I am not rich at all  but I felt the same feeling like yours  When I was 28 I made enough of money for keep myself living at least 5 6 years  then I had no motivation to keep making more  then I decided to write I write in Chinese   that s a thing I wanted to do since I was very young  I quited my job and rent a apartment and write as if I am a pro writer  I wrote a lot and I felt passion  but after 1 year  I got totally  nothing  for it  no publisher want to publish my work  I fail in all the literary award  then I begin to think that all of this is wasting time  I was happy when I creating story  but it feels like not worth it if only for fun or for be happy  I kept struggle some more till I am 30 this year  I began to work again  and what I gonna do when I retire again  I have no idea ,2,0

Much of those matters you discussed sound very familiar to me   The first time I  retired  I started studying instead  I went back to university and decided to take a new degree  Having been high performer in work I just took all the courses I wanted in 1 year and after that I realized that there is no point in me staying because I had learned everything I wanted from the subject that I was interested in and the rest of the degree would have been far less interesting or useful   I went back to work in a new field because a friend asked for help with one project and I ended up doing a few more projects and then I suddenly realized that I was working 14 hour days again  I retired for the second time  And played some video games and exercised a lot more  Then I got bored and another group of former colleagues started calling that there were interesting and demanding consultancy projects so I went to do a few of them  I got sucked into it pretty deeply again  very fast  but then I remembered to start putting bigger boundaries for myself  I took some more time off and then went back in conditionally where I would only work perhaps 1 3 of the year and do something else with the rest  Now this is perhaps a bit better situation  I may have found a balance where I work for a few months each year  perhaps from November to March  pretty miserable weather during that time where I live in  and then do all kinds of hobbies and catching up and what ever with the rest of the year  It just seems like a constant flow and ebb though  sometimes work just comes and needs to be done or some interesting project pops up and those opportunities are fun to be picked up  And then it turns stale and routine again  Maybe it would make sense to get better jobs  but what would they be  Everything that has a forced schedule is pretty boring in the end ,4,0
It s more about social belongings to certain social reference groups that make us a human being in a given society  The real definition of retirement should be you are actually working on things that you are passionate about  Money shouldn t be a matter by that point ,1,0

Finally  after years of being in storage  the travel video footage is being utilized allowing for its true value to be realized  You probably have a dozens to hundreds of hours of footage that you can use that will bring more value to your Youtube channel in the future ,38,2
A lot of travel and vanlife channels would kill to have a big store of footage to incorporate in future videos ,1,
I agree with you 100 ,2,
My personal take  1  humans are social creatures  generally we need to have some contact with other humans   that is fulfilling   2  we find meaning in life by achieving tasks such as saving gaining    doing a job task well  art  travel etc   If you can involve other humans then that s the icing on the cake   Everyone has different abilities  capabilities  tastes etc  You just gotta find what s right for you  and have a good attitude to achieve these goals  Simple  ,2,0
You are my mentor bro  Much respect  Deep advice and valuable feedback  Dude  you are on point ,1,0
Maybe it is better to say   I m unemployed  as a millionaire ,1,0
 That s what ex wives would ask you   Pure gold    ,92,1
The thing is that many professions such as software development  sciences  doctor  climbing  sports  etc  they re all fun when you do them as a hobby  but when you have to do them to earn a living it just takes all the fun out of it ,16,2
Some type A personalities very much enjoy high pressure  competitive lives  and the idea of doing better than the next person is very motivating to them   But I remember reading a heart surgeon saying his job gave him immense satisfaction as to doing a moral as well as interesting and valuable thing in the world  while making great money     and he said if he won the lottery he would quit tomorrow   It s still just a job ,1,
Doctor as a hobby    ,7,

My life post early retirement will be  diversified  into 3 categories of activities  Productivity   Purpose  Pleasure  People 1  Pleasure  Do fun activities that I enjoy  could be as simple as netflix   video games  eating out  travelling  exercise  this falls into productivity  2  People  Make sure I do some kind of social activity  This can be met with joining group classes   religious groups   meetups  This can also be as simple as chit chatting with your husband   wife  calling friends  posting in online forums etc  3  Productivity  Making sure I check that  feeling productive  or  sense of purpose  bucket that work usually gives  Examples  online volunteer software engineering projects for non profits  writing stories on websites   forums  writing my own blog  going to a library and committing to finishing a book in a week etc,24,0

Honestly  we love the sarcastic delivery but you are literally dropping philosophical gems when it comes to life and many young people need to listen and truly understand ,426,9
 Texas scifi He probably has Aspergers and I m not implying is a negative trait  It allows you to prioritize on important tasks and block out a lot of the noise in life  At the same time  it will seem very cold to bystanders  But it s one of those things you re born with or steered to in early childhood  although probably just the severity of it  so it s not like you can really do anything about it ,1,
His lack of empathy and inability to take blame or criticism are red flags to me   No I don t believe he is a good example    His cold video series of egotistical logic over empathy towards others is a serious red flag,2,

I have learned that health is one of the most valuable assets to have ,274,13
If your health is poor  what does it matter how much money you have  Would rather be homeless and healthy than rich and bed ridden    ,1,
True  especially after 35 when all your vices catch up with you  Don t smoke,1,
So true  and let s make sure to include mental health in the package ,2,
Yup  that s why I lift and stay active  It s the best thing you can do  on so many levels and systems  in your body,1,
 Boxing Bandit   depends what you work in,2,
 Chinnini Not true at all  It doesn t have to be that way ,1,
My first boss told me You sacrifice you health to make money and then you use that money to recover your health,4,
Actually the most valuable asset  If you have terminal cancer or some other sickness that would be fatal  does money  time or youth matter anymore ,15,
Totally  All else is meaningless without health ,25,

You re the one who introduced me to him  Glad you did  ,13,
Life is actually pretty meaningless and boring once you meet your goals  The meaning is the journey ,464,40
It s important to have open ended goals  not just concrete ones   You want a big house and get one    what then  Compare to artists and craftsmen and many sportsmen who can continue to challenge themselves and better themselves and their work hobby for decades  if not their whole lives   And often regardless of what or whether they get paid   TechLead describes photography as a thing to master  not as a passion or artistic exploration   Did Ansel Adams ever figure  well  I know how to do photography now  but I m not making enough money from it  so there s no point to it anymore   Having a creative and or intellectual interest can do a lot to fill a life   Getting X Y Z stuff is great  but not necessarily fulfilling  and it always leaves you needing to get more stuff instead of working on whatever it is we have of a soul or spirit   If all you want is what a robot can do perfectly  you re essentially a robot yourself  just not as good ,1,
 Silent Butter Bruh I m not a seamstress  If you are completely satisfied with all you have done  it s doubtful you are a person who was ever driven to do anything that ever proved anything to anyone ,1,

Lol  what  That s dumb  Just set new goals  If you actually think for a minute there s countless goals to pursue which require more than just money and would easily keep you busy for the rest of your life  If you think you ve done everything then you re probably too focused on yourself instead of the world around you ,1,
 D Miller Got 7 kids and wife of 38 yrs  and have made over a million dollars  Worked 2 full time jobs for 20 years at 60 God has given me a great life and working helps me have structure  One job  where I worked as a chemist for 36 yrs is closing down and my second shift job as a chemist will hire me on first shift when we finish up closing the doors on my first job   Life is great  wonderful and worth living because of what God has done for us  In all you do   do everything for Him and he will make your paths straight    Proverbs 3  4  5 ,5,
Most goals are too hard to reach and some not so much But once you finish it all Every activity you always wanted to do and be able to buy anything    You ll feel empty,2,
Personally I think some people search too hard for meaning and purpose in their life  I feel the only proper way to do that is to take each day one at a time and be patient until something clicks  Just focus on your health  don t do anything stupid  and give it time ,7,
After you achieve your man made goals then your vision is no longer clouded and you can clearly see life for what it really is  what it always has been and what it always will be  meaningless   There s only one philosophical question in life  suicide  A  Camus ,5,
 D Miller try building a business so you can feed 25  families,7,
Ive met a few self made millionaires who were around 25 35 years old  They said that they did lots of travelling and spending less and less time with friends and mainly focused on family as they got older ,10,
The meaning is the journey through fear ,3,
If you re not making new goals  then you re shooting yourself in the foot,1,
Try raising a family  You ll be challenged and your journey will be long ,22,
 Nomad Black If that s your realization  your goals were trash to begin with ,26,
Nah,1,
Wrong  There are always more goals to meet ,52,
The type of personality that allows someone to retire in their 20s is the same personality that doesn t allow someone to actually enjoy retirement ,237,10
 S G I find it easier to believe that they worked their way to 7 million than that they saved their way there   It takes a big income and many decades for most people to save just a fraction of that ,1,
Probably true for most early retirees  yeah,2,
yes thats exactly the thing,2,
 S G Curse  More like a blessing to me  Sounds like you re just making an excuse to blow all the money once it inherits to you since it s a  curse  you must get rid off ,20,
Thats not true at all though   Being flexing and having the ability to set your priorities right can get you both  Its just hard to find the line that gets you there ,2,
 Optimum Insight they also have a social obligation to pass on the wealth to the kids  me   The curse ends when I don t get married or have kids and spend on myself  ,6,
  S G this is something I worry about a lot  I don t spend much on myself  but then I wonder whether its out of habit or because I don t think spending will make me happy so i don t bother ,9,
My family has 7 million dollars saved and they live like peasants   its that mentality that got them there  It is like a curse ,32,

 Kevin Rosas I hate to be realistic  but most Americans live paycheck to paycheck  Only the the mega rich can play the stock market  invest in crypto schemes  Most of the wealth in America is held by people that never worked a day in their lives  You can t tell people to invest in a system they can t even start in  workers can t play the rich game ,4,
 Kevin Rosas so nice of you to completely misread a simple statement,3,

Where does your frugality come from     did you grow up poor   ,1,0
I will retire early but at 40  Im 32   not as young as you did  What I ll do I think is first not much planning  just taking it day by day and enjoy my new gained freedom  Play video games to my heart s content  And then I really want to take at least 6 months   1 year to travel different Asian countries  live for cheap  meet new people  discover new horizons  Once I get to India I want to stay there at least 3 months in an Ashram and focus on spirituality  see if I can grow in that area  After that  who knows  It s too far ahead ,3,3

 Kandy Foma Underneath his cold  hardened millionaire facade full of sarcasm this is quite true ,1,
If you listen very carefully to his videos  you will see that he value family a lot  and being able to provide for his family  and spend time with his kids is one of the thing he values,1,
Don t you think he has learned his lesson  as a millionaire  ,6,
Well  money allows you to have   firepower   and to do things in larger scales like  building a business rather being an employee of said business   I Think if i would have that amount  i think i would start something either to compete with Twitter   Facebook without their flaws  and makes a worthy and successful alternative   Today  the Tech world is more powerful than ever  and i think it would be a waste to not use the opportunity to makes things better ,1,0

Are you going to stay a millionar all your life when you going to move up a gear and talk a billionair,1,0
Going after sensory stimulation  like scuba diving and travel  are nice  but intellectual pursuits are more appealing to me  Math  philosophy  physics  comp sci     For that a work or academic environment is great  because you interact with people who are really engaged in their pursuits  Taking a sabbatical from work from time to time is really important  I let myself get trapped in mortgages and a gold digging wife  so I didn t do enough sabbaticals  So my plan is to continue along that line ,1,0
I like this guy    superficially of course   No warmth but pure reason    You can see why Japan has an advanced civilisation post WW2 and it was built by guys like this    Not the current generation though who are slowly being turned soft and dependent ,1,3
See his earlier videos    he is not Japanese and is just there from San Francisco to visit his kid from divorced marriage ,1,
Why are you sooooo relatable  ,11,2
Because you want Techlead senpai to notice you ,1,
so much information   so hard ,2,0
You re also a good photographer those shots are surreal,13,1
I agree with you 100 ,1,
This gradient is awful ,2,0
I got pseudo retirement at a job that paid well with low demands and having low life cost  I do work around 30 to 50  more hours than is necessary for the intellectual challenge and fun  but also spend my time mostly on family  growth  and occasional travel  It s still hard to get used to not having an urgent project deadline ,12,2
That s actually a great option that few people consider  If you can find a low demand job with remote work and a flexible schedule  it could reduce the amount of time you would need to  retire  in decades  I feel like ppl really just want a lifestyle with less stress  more freedom and time for themselves when they talk about retirement,3,
This is the guy Musk dreams he was     as a millionaire ,2,0
If I could retire   I would try to create artificial general intelligence and once it s created would ask to solve aging problem  At least it something meaningful in contrast of just spending time and waiting when I get old and die ,1,0
Soon  Tech Lead will reach a new level   THICCC FIRE   ,65,0
I m tempted to drop out of the corporate IT wageslaving and shift into something more trade y  I don t really need any more money for a lean FIRE lifestyle  which is pretty comfy  and I d like to spend less time in front of computers and more time doing physical things  Or I could see dropping from 8 hours of corporate work to maybe 4 hours of  self employment  project work  blog  game  art  and spend the extra time on more active   outdoorsy things  like bike rides  Or more relaxing sauna time   Especially now  with work from home involving little work and not being very satisfying  Did you know that I m working right now  It s hard to tell  Part of me hopes that I get severed   laid off   fired for lazy work from home behaviors so I have to make a change  but in the meantime I m making too much money for too little effort to walk away ,2,1

 Lukas Haha  well I don t know for how long  I could also just stare at a single spot in space  Or walk around  I really don t have the issue of not working  Actually  that s when I feel the best  I live on my own terms  I don t socialise when I don t feel like it  I socialise when I do feel like it  I don t have anybody nagging me  telling me what to do  etc  Only problem is  time flies to fast when I feel too good ,22,
