If you can  invest in a diverse portfolio  I achieved it with the help of a copy trading strategy run by  Nicole Deanne Mckay   It s been a great weight lifted off my shoulders  I m making good money with little to no effort on my side  Her stock recommendations are excellent  and my aggressive portfolio continues to generate substantial profits  I can tell you she s a trading and portfolio diversification genius ,3,
I m seeking for a better investing approach because I have a large quantity of money sitting in a savings account earning close to nothing  I m open to any excellent recommendations on how to deal with this turbulent market because you appear to be doing well yourself ,2,
 John Wes  Creating wealth isn t easy because some natural human characteristics that need to be fought  Investors lack patience   get tempted to reorganizing their portfolio when small movements occur in the market  Just start holding with conviction   only focus on the balance sheet ,2,

This a great video  I learn alot watching your videos and it has been helpful to me  building a steady income is quite difficult for newbies  Thanks to Kristin Hartman for improving my portfolio  keep up with good videos ,36,8
  TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems  It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC   More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  I have made over 11 btc from day tradng with  mr Kelly Max   insights and signals in less than 2 weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish  ,1,7

On average  millionaires invest 20  of their household income each year  Their wealth isn t measured by the amount they make each year  but by how they ve saved and invested over time  Get your money working for you  start buying in slowly and then gradually increase the pace of buying as the prices continue to drop  Personally still going hard on this crazy market and I m doing just fine  so far i ve made over  100k in profits from the Q1 of 2022  The market will remain a money den for those who know where to look  Leverage on this  adding more stocks at a time,13,7
The FED knows  They aren t committed to  attacking   inflation  I been trying to stick with index funds  I feel this new interest rates hikes could crash this economy nevertheless  it will be highly delusional to hold money that should be working for you ,1,
Well said  Investing and becoming wealthy are easy but being patient is very hard  Achieving your most wanted goals is to never lose sight of the results and keep working persistently towards it  By taking positive actions every day  you will lead your life in a beneficial direction and eventually achieve more than you may even have thought possible ,3,
The earlier you start putting money toward your future  the more it can grow  One thing that can keep people from saving for retirement is lingering debt  By the time you re 50 years old  one big debt hurdle you may have left to clear is your mortgage  I invest the same amount each paycheck  Only means that I m buying greater amounts of stock with the same amount of funds  Even if we see a crash  that s still a que to keep putting in my investment dollars  The market will always recover and continue the climb ,5,
 Nathan miller  I have my funds well diversified though I did it  using copy trading system from a US regulated broke r     Mary Freed Lorenz     a US registered CFA and CNBC contributor  Tbh it s been a huge relief  Good earnings and little to no engagement at all on my part  Her stock picks are top notch  my aggressive port folio still kicking rocketing in huge figures     I can tell you she s quite the genius in trading and port folio diversification  Do a little re search on her,2,

Treasures in Heaven Matthew 6 NIV  19  Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth  where moths and vermin destroy  and where thieves break in and steal  20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven  where moths and vermin do not destroy  and where thieves do not break in and steal  21 For where your treasure is  there your heart will be also   22  The eye is the lamp of the body  If your eyes are healthy  c  your whole body will be full of light  23 But if your eyes are unhealthy  d  your whole body will be full of darkness  If then the light within you is darkness  how great is that darkness   24  No one can serve two masters  Either you will hate the one and love the other  or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other  You cannot serve both God and money   Do Not Worry  25  Therefore I tell you  do not worry about your life  what you will eat or drink  or about your body  what you will wear  Is not life more than food  and the body more than clothes  26 Look at the birds of the air  they do not sow or reap or store away in barns  and yet your heavenly Father feeds them  Are you not much more valuable than they  27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life e    28  And why do you worry about clothes  See how the flowers of the field grow  They do not labor or spin  29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these  30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field  which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire  will he not much more clothe you you of little faith  31 So do not worry  saying   What shall we eat   or  What shall we drink   or  What shall we wear   32 For the pagans run after all these things  and your heavenly Father knows that you need them  33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness  and all these things will be given to you as well  34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow  for tomorrow will worry about itself  Each day has enough trouble of its own ,1,1

To make extra money while I m working at the office  from March of this year I m using cryptocurrency case speculating with ascending and descending of BTC  ETH   others like HIGH everyday  waiting for around x1 5 or x2 till the end of 2022    Also because I live in Russia and not going to move somewhere  I have Russian stocks on MOEX which  like I expect  will be able to make me safe when inflation of    RUB  will reveal itself  The more money will print Central Bank the more assets of Russian IT companies will cost  That s my strategy  But I have many concerns about political situation  I m against this war  anyway there is no robust hope for cryptomarkets as Binance will work in Russia  so I think Russian people should search for another cryptomarket or take the risks staying with already became such comfortable instruments which can rust any moment ,2,1

3 40 if you have it continually buy when it goes down and sell when it goes up  anyone know what happens when it eventually breaks out of the range straight up in one direction or another    Is there a stop loss exit in place   Just looking at it it seems like it will continually buy  or sell  until funds run out in either direction ,1,2
There s a range that either you or the bot can set and if it goes over or under it just stops buying and selling  You can put a stop loss in place if you manually change the settings but the  moon  bot TL was using has a massive range that you can use if you re bullish with no stop loss ,2,

All the time I watch your videos  I feel motivated to be a programmer  But  every time I really listen to what you say  I feel that is best to earn real money being what I love to do ,63,9
 High Times It will grow  Don t worry about your future  But  if you really like it  Study it properly  Don t be a coder  Be holistic problem solver that understand code  Learn the technical skills that will get you money now  but don t let future robots steal your job  So learn as well to think critically and out of the box  Be a problem solver  Learn about UX or Product Design  for example  and you will get paid more for your job  Trust me ,1,
 Alisson Paulinely Just remember  You can always do another thing if you find it s not your thing  I have switched careers like 4 times now  including programming  and I m 25 years old  so I dont have a family to feed so I can try until I get to what is my purpose     Do what you consider correct in the moment  You never know where you ll end up going  But keep yourself busy and make money while you can  But always have a clea picture about your situation from a higher perspective  Don t encage yourself ,1,
 BBallMOU as I don t get an fluent english level  I struggle sometimes to said as easy I can do in portuguese  but you still got the point    Programming looks like a good area to make some money  and really looks fun to me    When I was teen I usually did a bunch of things in the computer  but after working 6 years in the front of a computer in a tiny space  barely seen the time passing  I was a transcriptionist in a radiologist medical clinic   the amount of things to type was great and stressful   I really wonder if it s really what I wanna to do for  all  my life  Maybe this experience drained me out   Being fun don t necessarily mean that you d like to do it everyday in a great portion of your life   I know  with the time  I can do more management and entrepreneur things  and less code  but why I just don t go directly to it  The answer can be  because the money that a didn t have   and working as a programmer can be a way to it   But  then  comes the part of being mediocre  and barely earning to survive well  and not taking exceptions as rules   And then don t being able to do much money  even to do the entrepreneur things    So  maybe I really can get success with code  but I know that I was far from someone that code for a long time and has more experience than me on it and as a entrepreneur    It really sounds like an limiting belief  but is just a question of where I really can aggregate value   I had recently failed in a 5 year project  and now  more then ever  I know that need a good mind about what I gonna do   I can t afford spend more time  to in the end realize that there was not the place where I can really aggregate value to the society with what I do and being recompensate as I expect   I really get excited about jumping in code  but I do stay with a feet back  for as you ve said  it s a normal job that will have some real boring and discouraging moments   In reality  I was in a dilemma about it  But Patrick said exactly how I see it      something to do a while and then jumping out       This is a red flag I guess   This is what I ve tried to say  where I love and can aggregate more value  is what I really should being doing   And at the same time that his content and success inspires me to really considering to code  makes me remember that maybe it s not for me   So I feel like it s a great opportunity but maybe this can t be for me  It s a struggle for maybe losing a good opportunity or saving me years of frustration   But that s the risk   win or lose     Ps   I believe that we can change what we do during the life  but I think that if I m pretending to entrepreneur in the area  this  area thing  will stil be in my mind even if I do not code anymore  Off course I can  deep dive  into it and later sell the project  maybe it s my moment  But I feel that this maybe can be only a temporary thing  job  to then seek what I really love ,2,
I get it  You feel motivated TO BE a programmer  but not TO DO programming  So  you attach your expectations of that lifestyle to your motivation  You will not succeed as a programmer if you do it for another reason other than liking to program every day  I studied software engineering for some time  I was good at it  but I find it very boring  I enjoy high level design of solutions  not writing code for a machine to understand me  Programmers spend their times translating human language to PC language  A very important task that if you like it s well paid  BUT  I don t think it has much future   Writing code  wo nt be a thing in 20 years from now ,3,

It seems you almost reverberated the same thought process I had when first discovering bots  DCA spot  etc  being in love with the concept of passive returns  After delving further in research  applying different strategies I advocate  holding btc is remarkably stronger than people seem to understand  BTC is a unique in which  dedicating a lump sum of holdings  to determine a steady grid analysis is dangerous  rigorous and is contradictory to what people label as  passive income   Whether the  bot can be unattended its without question one must still be relevant on news or face repercussions that may have been avoidable if you were simply bullish and held btc living your life  The link is a referral  fees and transactions are going to waste you money  If you support btc you know to avoid exchange  byeeeeeeeeeeeeee,3,2

Techlead I like you better before when you were teaching tech instead of selling stuff like trading bots  You didn t even discuss the win rate ratio of the trading bot,11,2
Bots are not reliable  You will lose the gain on the upswing and end up buying a losing token big on the drop  Imagine if a coin drops to 90  and never recovers   you will hold a ton of it because you average down   It always underperform buying and holding  If you trade with bots even with BTC USDT pair you will always be holding more stable coin so you will lose the opportunity  ,2,1
Remember holding is also a form of trading  For most people  just holding bitcoin is the safest  Techlead is promoting trading bot because he s sponsored  but there s risk of impermanent loss also  If you don t understand what you re doing  it s better to just buy and hodl  remember most traders loses money long term ,11,3

How does a grid trading bot compare to putting crypto crypto  e g  BTC ETH  or crypto stablecoin  e g  BTC USDT  into a DeFi liquidity pool  in terms of risk reward ,8,4
if done right a crypto bot can make you 10 30  per month depending on the coin you trade and the market  btc is usually the least volatile coin  so you ll have rather 5    month  with a god bot set up  some generic bot setup probably less  I played around with bots a lot  the thing is you need to trade with the current trend  if markets go down and you use a generic btc bot  it does make profit but since the value of btc goes down  too  you ll end up either making a loss or the bot stops trading  coz the price falls out of its grid   but if you use a short token for btc then it works  I made 35  in April with a bot shorting ada  if I just used a btc or ada bot I d be in the reds  of course you can wait until prices are going up again but this might take a few months  so if you want to do nothing a liquidity pool makes more sense  if you can invest 2 3 hours a week  do some research and a bit of practice  bot trading will outperform LM ,1,
