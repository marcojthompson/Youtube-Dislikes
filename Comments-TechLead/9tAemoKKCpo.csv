Why can t you just go to jail and stop spreading misinformation,3,
 JJ Valez i mean I wouldnt do this without fully understanding the concept  It seems like TechLead it promoting it a bit carelessly tbh  But I think there are probably ways to do it with less riska  I was thinking about combing this with arbitrage  There lots of good options out there  Just saw a token today for  13 on one cex and  24 on another soo      ,3,
Changes in the million dollar site   Good  More info   Bad  two first blocks feel less lambo and more kindergarden  First block to many colours and I wouldn t put the partnerships there  you have it longer down on the landing page   Keep the intro to the website clean  Second block  those emojis are very happy and cute for the kids   Overall I would keep a more mature look  in the ROAR MAP block spirit   Just my opinion  project looks great and the previous clean style of the website convinced of investing in the first place  1 2 months ago ,1,

Ok I have a question  What about when you want to withdrawal the money and buy like a car  Wouldnt you have to pay back what is borrowed in order to receive the profits  And if not will you at some point have to repay what was borrowed ,1,2

I don t think this works  You re not actually getting the money  You re only multiplying a number on a screen  Because at the final step you have about 3 1k total balance and 2 1k borrowed  So the 1k left is the same exact amount you went in with  Even if we do this 100 times and make it 50 000 total and 49 000 borrowed then it s still the same sh t we started with  So what s the actual profit then  Where s the money we made and actually able to take out ,1,2
I m VERY new to Defi    What s the total risk that you have in this trade cycle  Is it just you initial  1000 investment  What keeps you from transferring  2000 of BTC to a different wallet and never repay the loans ,1,2
NICE VIDEO      I HAVE BEEN TRADING FOR MONTHS NOW  I KEEP MAKING MORE LOSS TRADE WRONG COINS PLEASE I NEED SOME KIND OF ASSIST OR ADVICE ON WHAT TO DO,4,3
Great video there  Also i agree with your opinion  For the newbies  If you are actually trading in the crypto space and you don t have a sound mentor  Then you are certainly going to get liquidated  lose  in 90  of your trades   Yeah that s the sad truth  For a start  you need a good and experienced hand to guide you  Trust me  trading isn t difficult as we see it  With the right information and guide  you can earn hugely monthly  I started off with copy trading were i just have to copy my mentors trading signals  You should try it if you are new to trading ,407,10

After watching several YouTube tutorial videos about trading I am still making losses  please I seek for a better website,1,
This Video is just complete bullshit imo  He is just always reducing the amount of money he has access to  and is paying multiple interest lol   Thats also why he doesn t show the 3000  in Metamask or later in Quickswap he allegedly now has access to  If he could really use the 3000  in Quickswap  which would be therefore in his wallet   AAVE would be down in hours because people would just lend the money and never pay back the money they got  it would just be literally money printing ,1,3
Sorry I m a little slow  say if he could repay his loans using other funds to negate the interests  still how does he earn from quickswapping to prove his  INSANE GAINS  objective  Claiming rewards from the swap would take so long it wouldnt exactly be rewarding    An elaborated ruse to make his viewers pile on into his MM token pool ,1,
exactly lol you can t actually use that money,1,
i dont get it  is the over collateralization of USDT not just the same as a leveraged short position on USDT  i mean i cannot withdraw more than my initial 1000 USDT to do Liquidity Mining or other techniques to earn more interest than the borrow fees  So its just a speculation on USDT dropping in Price ,1,2

 The easiest way of all to earn money from your crypto may be to deposit your funds into a platform that offers you an annual percentage yield  APY  on the money you hold on their platform  This is similar to depositing money into a savings account at a bank that gives you an annual percentage return on what you hold in your bank account ,5,3

I m not sure I followed here  I definitely understand the part where you get more yield by depositing what you ve borrowed  but what seems to be missing is the fact that every time you borrow  the APY is higher than the APY of your deposit  for obvious reasons   So wouldn t that negate your gains     In fact  at the end of this video  he has approximately  1 000 USDC and  2 131 75 worth of BTC  deposited at 3 52  and 0 04  APY respectively  which would yield  ceteris paribus   36 05 per year  On the borrow side  he has  2 148 USDT  at a cost of 3 98  APY  which would create a cost of  85 49 per year  rendering this a negative ROI investment  What am I missing  ,5,4
Anyone  No answers  I m halfway following curious also lol,1,

if you borrowed  2000 in tether while it s trading at  1  Then the price of tether drops to  01c or goes up to  100 per coin   you will still owe  2000 in tether    the interest rate   If you get liquidated you lose all of your collateral to cover what you ve borrowed   This play only works if you think a coin will shoot up in price in a short period of time ,1,2

Why not borrow USDC against USDC 300 or 400    The only fear of liquidation would be 1  the peg of USDC changes or 2  you calculate no buffer for the interest rates  Correct me if I am wrong but this would be the best way in my opinion  I am thinking of borrowing 20k USD from originally 5k USD deposit ,2,1

Man you re the best,1,0
Although the concept here is right  this particular execution of a  looping  technique is amateur and not advised  If you follow this strategy by maxing out your LTV  loan to value  you will get rekt   Even stablecoins slightly lose their peg from time to time  Not to mention the BTC price is VERY volatile  Proceed with caution ,14,4
 Martin Watts i have done my homework  Unfortunately what your preaching is skeptical poppycock based on charts and not your own work,1,
 Alford Elliott please do you homework ser   look at charts of stablecoins  Its not often that they lose peg but occasionally they have a flash depegging   but that might be enough to trigger a liquidation if you are maxed out  It depends on the stablecoin   more established coins are less likely to have issues ,2,
sorry what you said is not true stable coins dip is not so significant that you get rekt ,1,
What if  after you borrow  you send it into another wallet of yours  will you shortly get the Token  money  and its not traceable ,2,2

This video as many of your other videos are very entertaining  I think many people will be able to tell that you are being fictitious when you appear to encourage overleverage  However  there are also many that will take you serious as you can see from the comments   Your failure to not at least call out this is something people should not do is very irresponsible ,1,2

I do not get this  Isn t the point of the whole over collateralizing is that you will have more USDT to do farming with  You started with 1k and ended up with 130 or so  What good does that do  I get the yield farming is good but what has it got to do with the over collateralizing ,2,2

Your money means nothing in an alley,1,2
Isn t the interest rate on the loan higher than what the collateral is  How much of the collateral can borrowed on and used to invest later  I thought you can only take 80  and that s why it was less and less you could borrow on  I m missing something   ,1,1
 OMG  EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         i got resources from     HoYs BaR    ,2,0

 TechLead have you looked at writing arbitrage bots combining flash loans from AAVE  A couple of DEX s are about to launch on Cardano as well which might be better due to much lower gas fee s although it would be written in a functional language rather than a contract oriented language like solidity and I don t know how that would look ,7,4

In finance  the greater fool theory suggest that a fool could sometimes make money from buying assets with little or no value  as long as they could later be sold at an even higher price to an even greater fool  These assets typically produce nothing and are generally symbolic or speculative in nature  A large majority of people who subscribe to the greater fool theory typically are left holding the bag after a correction  when there are no more fools left to buy their asset ,2,2

There are so many ways to accumulate and stack up your  portfolio  The crypto market has been unstable  People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs  Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading  I m still an investor and still I m winning by applying the same method in every trade  you can also become a winner today  We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market  bulls or bears   which is trading  Buy the Dip and Trade     I have made over 6 btc profits by trading with Rhett Susan a veteran trader ,7,11

Nah humbleness is a worthless trait  it s for losers who need other people to like them so they pretend to be humble about their position  Honesty is what matters  Truth is what matters  Reality is what matters ,4,
 fr0st2k5 I am thinking both  I think he amuses himself and us by somewhat playing a character that is an extension of his real personality  He is very good at not pulling the curtain back too much to reveal his own personal land of Oz  Honestly  I enjoy his videos more because of that ,2,

With so much abundance and amazing options  in the market right now  this has to be the shittiest and most unfitting advice you can give  Just why   We ve witnessed leverage traders being wiped out thIs entire month  and that s your  advice     Good job feeding your fans to the wales ,1,1
Tether is a fraudulent cancer on cryptos and is going to blow everything up eventually ,2,1
 This is the concept of extreme ownership ,26,0
So I have one 1 eth should I use that as collateral and do that whole process you mentioned it s honestly ingenious,1,1
So essentially you get more exposure to other coins with less initial investment,7,0
Thank you   please more advanced DeFi tutorials,18,1

Lol he s just trying to lure some idiots to leverage all their savings and use it to give liquidity to his own token so he doesnt risk it himself  The sad part is that some will fall for it,17,1
You don t get it do you,3,
Lol funny smart,1,2
There are two options    1  wait for Tether to implode  which is speculative but might happen  risky though      Or    2  eventually  once you are overleveraged and have enough balance  switch the coins to CRO  or any other performing token  and wait for it to grow a little before paying back the borrowed Tether and pocketing the difference  Otherwise  I m having a hard time understanding how you can actually profit from this   ,17,3
Tether is like the actual US Dollar  printed non stop  BRRRRRRRR   LMAO   ,2,

 Daniil Ulianov You just can t withdraw the collateral  until you pay back what you took,1,
 Connor Weston he can t use 2200  of the borrowed money since it s stuck in the platform as collateral  the only thing that he s making higher and higher as he borrow is the interest rate,5,
 Mohamed Ghiar In short he is borrowing to turn his  1000 into 3200 to put into an LP  If I understand correctly has his initial amount of  1000 barrows up to around 3200 and then puts it into a LP  In turn  he is using the borrowed money to make money from that pool  The APY he gets from the LP is higher than the interest rate he is paying on the borrowed money  He is also banking on Tether crashing so he won t have to pay that back   Will that happen IDK  The worse that will happen is they will liquidate his account and he will be out  1000 bucks but if it doesn t liquidate then he basically is just making money off the LP APY  Again that is if I understand that correclty ,6,
  DlTCHMAGNET the maximum amount he can use will still the initial 1000  he deposited  so why borrowing  ,1,
 David O but when does he do this  He can t pull out the collateral without paying the tether loan first right ,10,
In the end  he puts the over collateralize assets into liquidity pool farming to earn a much higher interest rate ,12,
 Oliver Xu All borrowing is shorting   His primary trade is to go long BTC with leverage ,2,
he s effectively short tether  betting that it will go down ,2,
If the underlying bitcoin go up then the cost to service the debt will be negligible relative to his 3x leveraged gains ,3,
And looking the example he gave  when did he record that he was getting only 4 6 borrower APY on Tether    It was been much higher than that this whole month and only briefly dipped that low around October 30  but essentially this all betting on the notion that tether is about to blow up  and there will be nothing to pay back lol,2,
Thanks again TL  I did not understand a single thing you just showed us but what I do understand is  Million Token to da Moon   Lets go baby ,13,1
From what I see  when you ll get out of this system you ll lose 18 dollars  So what s the point ,3,1
This is amazing lmao  I love how you just casually kept over leveraging your acc to get more money  I just might do this lol,6,6
 Dante M good luck my guy lol,2,
 Dindola D andata 30x,5,
 Dante M I would not do more than 5x leverage  10x if you must  But if you do not even know how to read charts you are setting yourself up for liquidation ,1,

It s  free money  until BTC drops a mere 10 15  and you lose your entire account  Don t forget you re providing WBTC which is also only backed via a centralized provider  they could also go bust at any time ,153,31
 Nicol s Leyva what happened ,1,
This is exactly what causes cascading liquidations which makes the entire market tank ,2,
It would be interesting to hear his comments on this video now since BTC crashed and Tether didn t implode  I think this trick could be something when the bull market hits on BTC because you would pay back that tether loan instantly and wouldn t have to bank on tether sinking ,1,
 Jaydapp When you take out leverage on an exchange you are bound there  he was borrowing tokens so that he could then reinvest into LP mining farms ,1,
 Julian Scheucher what platform can you borrow USDC against USDC,1,
 Jaydapp id assume the benefit is that its just a metamask account  which is anonymous   as opposed to a cex that has his ID and can go after more money  or even his house  if they have to,1,
Why not borrow USDC against USDC 300 or 400    The only fear of liquidation would be 1  the peg of USDC changes or 2  you calculate no buffer for the interest rates  Correct me if I am wrong but this would be the best way in my opinion  I am thinking of borrowing 20k USD from originally 5k USD deposit ,2,
What if you take btc out of the equation  Take 1000usdt and rinse repeat as he did to borrow another 2000  There s a small interest rate  Take the borrowed 2000 usdt and stake it in nexo  Celsius etc to earn up to 10  on some platforms  There s an arbitrage opportunity  Given its a stable coin you can t lose your borrowings,14,
 Jaydapp  Yes please ,4,
 Ramiel What do you mean   come after you    Why would they have to do that   They already liquidated your account  you wouldn t owe them anything else   I m not sure if you understand how margin works but if you want I can maybe try to explain it better ,7,
 Philippe Dumonet  Suppose the worse happen and you lose everything  how they come after you ,4,
 Boykingrei My initial thought is maybe this   His risk is kind of spread around to more than one asset rather than just being invested in one   But all of that risk still hinges on any of them falling too far  I believe   But I guess it s outweighed by any of them mooning also   It s almost like the actual assets become a margin trade as well  if that makes any sense   But that s just my guess ,7,
 Jaydapp also have the same question,2,
 Meme Reddit What s the benefit  if there is one  of him doing this rather than just using an exchange that will allow him to trade on margin ,15,
Yes and another factor is you re paying interest to be able to leverage 3x,8,
Can he even lose the intial deposite in usdc with this methode ,7,
 Philippe Dumonet yeah makes sense  just wonder how far you could push it per the starting amount  like could you make a keypresser repeat the process thousands of times off of 10  to get to 1000  it looks like he got about 1 1th the starting amount per borrow cycle not sure if it reduces over time,7,
  CadetSparklez You re right in a way  It s leverage so if you have 1k and borrow 2k you essentially triple your upside and downside   The problem with leverage is it s subject to liquidation  Meaning if your assets become worth less than your debt  a little sooner even  you will get liquidated meaning you ll lose your account  Even if the supplied asset later recovers you ll still be left at 0 because your account was wiped out   So while you triple your upside you severely increase your downside  Only use it if you know what you re doing ,41,
the going bst part is the only increased risk I guess,3,
isnt  the point that you can only lose up to what you started with  so if you start with 1k and borrow 3k and it drops 25  you lose 1k  but if it goes up 25  you gain 1k  so its just allowing you to invest more money than you actually have  So its like skipping 5 years of compounding ,40,

This is so risky  If the price dropped or you dont have enough balance to be deducted form your wallet at the end of the period  ur collateral can be liquidated ,22,5
Maybe just drop few k for fun to test this out,2,
Oh  really  What do you think leverage trading is all about ,2,
Well only the borrowed money is liquidated  His initial collateral is usdc   a stable coin  I see this as a win  ,7,
This man is changing the world ,3,1
This marks the beginning of the end for crypto  sell your coins before it is too late  ,9,3
Hardly  This is how finance works ,1,
what s the point of doing this if the 2k you borrowed from the 1k is locked up as collateral until you pay back the 2k,11,3
It helps if you know solidity  You could write a smart contract to automatically liquidate the funds when they hit your target value  Unwinding manually is cumbersome and quite risky,1,
The point is to increase risk  The risk is high but if Tether goes down or WBTC goes up then he makes  2k relative  more money than if he had just used the 1k  To get his money out he would need to undo all of the lending one at a time if he didn t have enough cash to pay off the loan in one go ,2,

WTF happened with MM Token  biggest mistake in my portfolio,2,0
I m new in this channel and i didn t understand anything  could somebody explain to my what is collateral and what is defi   ,7,3
Defi is decentralized finance   It s basically the software he used to make all these trades   The loans are automated using smart contract technology   This is how he is able to make all these trades so quickly without having to go through a banker ,7,
Collateral is what you put up to back the loan   For instance if you buy a car with a loan  you put the car up for collateral so the bank can take the car if you stop paying the loan   Overcollateralized means you must put up an asset with more value than the money you are borrowing   Let s say you want to borrow 1000  you can let the lender hold onto your 1300 dollar bike until you repay the loan   That way the lender is protected if you stop paying or if the value of your bike drops 30 percent   Overcollateralization helps to ensure the lender does not lose ,8,

What if BTC price goes down by 10   Wouldn t that liqudate your stake and you will lose your collateral ,96,22
 Dark Brotherhood if you borrowed  2000 in tether while it s trading at  1  Then the price of tether drops to  01c or goes up to  100 per coin   you will still owe  2000 in tether    the interest rate ,1,
You lose all your collaterals  The safest way is to borrow stablecoins and deposit them instead of BTC ,2,
this guy is a literal evil villain,2,
Ya you wouldn t want them to liquidate but wait  Even if btc was still   usd will keep inflating well beyond 2  no  So you wouldn t need to pay it back over time  Btc will keep going up  If wallstreetbets did this en masse   ,1,
What if BTC goes up by 100    That s when being over leveraged shines and all those loans become easy to pay off ,1,
 bernhard selzinger why are you calling it theter rather than tether ,7,
 Tyler Durden I think there is like a 5  penalty for liquidation  plus if the btc drops about 50  all the usdc and wbtc would be liquidated to cover the  2148 USDT loan,1,
 Andrew G but it has no outcome  you pay more interest for borrowing then fpr lending  he s implicating that theter will collapse in the next two weeks and you wont have to repay your loan  but thats pure speculation    ,7,
he is speculating on a theter collapse and therefore he would be able to keep all collateral usdc and can repay usdt for 0 ,5,
Yes this is a satirical degen video like always ,32,
If you only did this method for stablecoins you would be pretty safe  assuming USDT or USDC doesn t rug ,13,
Risky stuff lol,3,
Yes you get rekt  You need to have other collateral or only work with stable coins where value hopefully never changes ,9,
I think that is leverage trading  If you cannot pay their APY fee at the borrowed rate  then they can take your collateral  I don t participate in borrowing only defi lending  So that s just a guess ,12,
