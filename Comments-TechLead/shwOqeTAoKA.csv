Great video really  Also i agree with your opinion  For the newbie if you are actually trading in the crypto space and you don t have a sound mentor  Then you are certainly going to get liquidated in 90  of your trades   Yeah that s the sad truth  For a start you need a good and experienced hand to guide you  Trust me  trading isn t difficult as we see it  With the right Signals and guide  you can earn hugely monthly ,250,13

 Market makers like to do the complete opposite of what retail thinks is gonna happen  sure a fakeout looks possible  but what if that s exactly what they want us to think  Imagine the big boys run with the money because we are simply too  scared  to buy in because we expect a fakeout  All thanks to Alice Marcella as I have made over 14btc from nov till date  His trading skills is exceptional    ,23,6

I HAVE INCLUDED SO MUCH LOSSES TRADING ON MY OWN  I TRADE WELL ON DEMO BUT I THINK THE REAL MARKET IS MANIPULATED  CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT I M DOING WRONG ,4,1
 I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling  Tradlng went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 2 BTC when I started at 1 5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Jayson Elwood  I would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about  ,174,8
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO  Bitcoin price is now okay how do I invest in bitcoin now  after you were talking about it as a conservative investment  in january I really want to invest i was waiting for day best time to invest  How can someone know a professional trader it has been my biggest dream,5,9
If someone doesn t understand what they are buying they shouldn t buy   You evaluate a smart contract platform like a pre revenue company  consider how it is being developed not what it is   Do you like a top down centralized approach where a small group holds ultimate power   Maybe you prefer one where holders of the token with an actual vested interest make the choices ,1,0
  I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader David Mayor   ,26,2
I d say 95  of Bitcoin investors are currently in Bitcoin to eventually increase their wealth in fiat  There will need to be a massive culture change for people to buy Bitcoin for purposes of living  This needs time though  but until then it s a speculative asset ,1,0

I love your breakdowns man always great work  One thing I would like to point out though  is the title of that reddit post where he s talking about buying owning a house  I don t think he s being unrealistic  Simply just buying a modest home  And I would agree him  Homeownership especially among millennials and onwards is at historic lows and worsening  People are Renting more  and Rooming with others more because homeownership is increasingly more difficult to do  And then covid came on top of it  Economic freedom I would say is the main selling point of cryptocurrency  Doesn t necessarily mean they want lambos and mansions  but enough income to live modestly and own a home instead of paycheck to paycheck  renting for the rest of their lives  That s where my thinking lies though  As always great stuff man keep it coming ,1,0

  I believe that the inflation is already priced in crypto market since the end of last year  These manipulative rats are always 2 steps ahead of everybody because they are market makers  I hope I m wrong and they won t keep dumping it on retail investors as always buffering Those who hold the longest will profit the most  I trade and hold profits keep up the great work  and also Lori Rachel  has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 37 BTC lately ,26,4

I ve been around for more than 1 2 century and I have seen my share of stock market contractions  Saw the birth of video gaming  and the birth of the internet  to name a few  Now  I get to witness the birth of blockchain and Crypto  and I can personally attest that Crypto is a completely different beast from the US stock market  100  agree that there should be a guarded approach to crypto investing  You may not win hearts and minds of everyone  but you have and are earning respect for telling the truth and trying to help others to look out for themselves  I m super picky who I listen too for crypto analysis   I have made over 21  btc from day trading with Jennifer Wilbur strategy Signal in few weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish ,90,9

I am a bit of skeptic  but know a lot of aspects about BTC  So  let s make few things straight   BTC is an investment asset   like gold  it s scarce  but it s easier to acquire it and big players like pay pal and grayscale are holding it  same with a lot of banking institutions  hedge funds and masses of people Self host wallet btc owner whales have a hard time selling it without doing KYC and in some cases  this can wreck them financially  People lose access to their btc wallets which makes that btc frozen for all time  The Hype and FOMO is on the rise and most people only buy and holding with btc  I mean you have to understand that normal stock market fundamentals don t apply here  It s not a 2017   2018 scenario  The regulation added to BTC can actually even make it more desirable although have a minus   Basically  anything that could stop the mooning of btc imo would be extreme regulation restrictions and also better investment opportunities discovered by btc owners However   it s is best advice you find a working strategy daily signals that works well in other to accumulate and grow a very strong portfolio ahead  I have been trading with Mr  Aron  Mason Craig daily signals and strategy  him guidance makes trading less stressful and more profit despite the recent fluctuations  I was able to easily increase my portfolio in just 4weeks of trading with Aron Craig daily signals growing 1 5 BTC to 6 7 BTC  His daily signals are very accurate and yields a great positive return on investment and is available to give assistance to anyone who love crypto trading  you can contact him on Telegram   Aroncraigsignal     for inquires and profitable trading systems ,1,2

There s a possibility winter is close or in as many argue that with rate hikes coming and the Fed supposedly rolling off it balance sheet will Bitcoin not continue to suffer  It may well do that and for me that then offers a long term entry point  as I sense the correlation dynamic will change in due time  Now in trading especially for a large portfolio  s gnal algos which are automated remains the best  Few traders I know use state of the art s gnal algos for their trading activities  My best pick is that of career trader Callum Lucas  his s gnals are based on unique combinations of trend  momentum  volume scanners and onchain analytics in which I ve accumulated over 9 2BTC already  Last week his analysis about the price action of bitcoin hitting 38k target was a hit  I think we all agree that the recent market drawdowns wasn t expected as it lead to cascading liquidations  Automated s gnal algos removes you from the crowd   If interested then reach out at  e     m callumlucas,49,1

 There s no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull  but BTC is going nuclear  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now  I d say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof ts should be the way of life that being said  the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of Josh Jhang s program  a pro trader who runs a training program for investors newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works  to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more bitcoin  with his program i went from having 1 3btc to 7 8btc in just 5 weeks,5,5
