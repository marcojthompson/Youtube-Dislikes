   This  current  run looks a mix of the previous two  Currently the PI indicator is about to indicate a Bitcoin top  According to bitcoin halving cycles  there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run  so  if the PI indicator  and Bitcoin  might repeat a similar bull run to 2013  That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough  but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyze the digital market  all this changed when I encountered Susan  s service   although I have been into numerous services but Susan Bossmann  stands out with experienced expertise in the field  I must confess it wasn t an easy task learning the routes on trading but with her assistance I earned a lot  H er             Susanbossmann,210,1

  I admire the efforts you put in your videos mate  Digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally  it s hard for anyone going against them these days  Though from a trader s perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the community works  Crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price dip over the past few days is just the beginning of greater things to come ironical though  lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy in the market and whether it isn t too late to buy an asset  when you re holding it could be but when trading its never too late to buy  a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price  bulls or bears   I trade using signals from trade expert Deniz Forsberg Trading Signals  with his guide and signal service i ve made over 6BTC worth of crypto assets over some months with an estimate of 1 5BTC as a start  You can easily get to him on               denizforsberg    cheers,185,10

   Many people are seeking stability in this unstable crpto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now  I d say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof  Ts should be the way of lifeThat being said  the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the William Johnson program  an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space  to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns  with their program i went from having 2btc to 9btc in just few weeks  Williams can be reached on T I  ramm     WilliamJohnsonn   ,143,13

Most newbies usually undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading  Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of assets prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market  Essentially  the procedure involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movement of an asset  Doing technical analysis can be quite different which is why most newbies traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to holding which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish  advise any newbies traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 96  trade accuracy  I underwent series of trading loses I d best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Mr KERRY PICKETT My contact with him has been the Pinnacle of this year for me  under his careful guide and his signal service I ve been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1 6 BTC to 7 BTC in just 5 weeks  I will advice traders and newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it  he can  be contacted ON TELEGRAM   PicKerry  trades for any Crypto related,9,10

Crypto market is becoming more appealing to investors seeking low correlation assets that diversify portfolios  I d say its outrightly wrong to just sit back H0DL and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life  even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position  The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen  I got this tips first hand from Dr  Bernard Theo  He s always a step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings has increased drastlcally from 4 1 B T C to 18 7 B T C in just 2 months and some days  I ve full confidence in his tradlng abilities  You can easily get to him           MrBernardTheo or maiI Bernardxtrades hotmaiICOM,55,3

As I understand it  Bitcoin was meant as a means to exchange value between two parties bypassing the banking systems and ecosystem  The exchange would occur and you then withdraw your value out of Bitcoin into a fiat currency of your choice then buy gold silver land etc    Bitcoin was never meant to be an investment vehicle  Some are using Bitcoin to fleece the people who are using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle  Manipulators control vast quantities of Bitcoin and make it go up and down for profit  But as people flee the US Dollar Bitcoin will benefit in the short term  Meanwhile the banking ecosystem is trying to make their own cryptocurrency to track and control the masses on a scale they never dreamed of ,1,0

You do realise he is being sarcastic and isn t actually talking about his own positions ,1,
dude is literally being sarcastic 90  of the time ,4,
 Techies everything he says is a fact,3,
He s not very knowledgeable about crypto to be honest  He s just riding the youtube algo  Most of his income comes from youtbe ,9,

you talk about countries banning bitcoin on the same day that El Salvador  Paraguay and Panama have expressed outspoken support for BTC   ,33,15
and who exactly are those 3 goverments  Do they ofer something except of drug dealing   money laundry and other illegal actions  You are talking about of non trusted govs,1,
A few banana republics  expressing support  is not a validation or hopeful sign for bitcoin  Rather the opposite I would say ,2,
Are they countries  Kiddin  They are ALL money laundering havens  and I have visited all of them  Crypto will be banned by the US and EU,3,
Lol those banana Republics  average millionaire in us has more wealth than gdp of those countries  Those are crime hubs ready to accept Bitcoin ,1,
those are just some banana republics,7,
lol highly corrupt governments probably getting huge bribes from drug cartels that want to keep their Bitcoin for money laundering,21,

Chances are all those companies do pentests regularly but pentests are not even close to perfect and even if they were  and they aren t  most of them just tick a couple of lowhanging fruit boxes  they are not a guarantee against getting ransomed  Remember  most hacks begin with a successful phishing attack anyways ,1,

GME jumped from 4 dollars per share to 280 per share in 1 year     it didn t take me to the moon    It did  you missed the boarding ,13,3
It also went from  480 to  40 in a month ,1,
But it had negative sustainable value and everybody knew it but their greed killed their brains ,1,

Correct me if I m wrong  here  let s look at Gold Vs US Government and todays Oils backed currency and the US Government  Crypto Vs US Government,1,
It s interesting that all of these articles putting out these doom and gloom articles regarding cryptocurrency is all connecting to the global financial sectors  I m going to  hold the line  ,5,0
Tech Lead and I have one thing on a common   We re both shorting   ,2,2
You re right but it s funny that your examples of scams in crypto are things that Wall Street does with fiat on a daily basis,1,2
I m just ready for crypto to fail so that I can actually find a decent GPU without having to sell a kidney for it ,61,9
I feel like my comments joking of his expressions have only served to fuel him     It is only a matter of time before he replicates  The Scream  by munch ,5,2
So in other words    let s just keep using our hyper inflated central banking system ,1,3
Tomorrow   Why I dumped all my money into District0x  as a crypto millionaire  ,3,2
Thank you the tech lead,1,1
Your bank must have never gone bankrupt like mine did if you think everything else but crypto is somehow  safe   The only money that s safe are the  ones in your pocket ,1,
Well  to be fair  the joke would be on them  Never invest what you can t afford to loose ,1,

Looks like someone skipped the economics class  and where were you in march  did you not see the crash ,2,
 Ahmet Koc then you should probably heed it  Im not a bot lol ,1,
In the long term  the stock market index has ALWAYS increased based on the past 100  years of history  Whereas crypto is very new and highly speculative driven  we don t know if it can stand the test of time the same way ,6,
Its not less risky but it is regulated  so there are rules  All crypto isnt going to die but vast majority will ,8,
WTF  Tech Lead is BIGGEST BEAR ever     priceless   ,85,10
Yeaa sure  Annnndd       Arch Angel CornPop Christ Fixed Earth and Mars with the Joe Biden Era ,1,
I was really hoping to see an ad for crypto exchange,2,2
Fear is the currency of Control  And whilst Fear is largely felt within the Crypto Markets  who do you thinks in control  Its clearly manipulation from Governments  media  whales  billionaires etc  I can tell you now that Crypto is not going anywhere  Its hear to stay and its going to be a big part of our future  The market could go much lower  but then no doubt in my mind its going to absolutely explode again at some point ,1,2
Ironically I would actually be worried if his videos were of a bullish sentiment,62,2
Exactly,1,

I better get my money out and put it back to my bank   Thanks for the heads up  ,1,1

Hubris   But I do keep watching you  I love the negative vibes    Crypto exchanges are nothing like Stock exchanges because Stock is regulated  Right  regulated like the in the US where violations for synthetic  ie  Fake  shares and failures to deliver brings BILLIONS in profits but incurs millions in fines    years later  Really  I don t mind the negativity  but just don t regurgitate main stream Hedgie bullshit  It belittles you ,15,1
Stock market is so regulated that the biggest three  market makers  can stop trading whenever their interests are threatened just like it happend with GME  We don t need regulation  we need only to eat the rich in fair competition ,3,
I m so glad at least 1 youtuber talks some sense about cryptos  Well of course he does  He s TechLead ,8,0
    The cyrpto market has been unstable  People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs  Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by tradling  I m still an investor but still I m winning by applying the same method in every trad e  you can also become a winner today  We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market  bulls or bears   which is tradlng  Buy the Dip and Trade   I have made over 6 btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing tradess with  s gnals supllied by MR Richard leo  For inquries into a profitable system u can easily getto Richard 0n              Richardleo4         ,55,7

Hey bro  what keyboard do you use ,1,3
I really like you speaking what needs to be heard   There are still youtube channels promoting ppl to buy     crazy,10,5
What s crazy is promoting people to sell right now   Just like people were selling when BTC hit 6K  2 years ago   But heh  buy high sell low  I guess ,1,
Poor man,1,
Sell is also a form of promoting buy  Someone has to buy the sell ,1,
Very informative,2,3
He spends a lot of time talking about something he doesn t think has a future ,7,5

Naive  You think in the wild wild west people don t start organising to gain advantage over the individuals  First you got gangs  then Mafia  then dictatorship    Getting rid of the government  you ll end up with a bad one ,9,

 Imran A yeah  lots of people have the same mindset as you and will sell at 89c  and people will sell at 88c to get rid of the 89c guys  etc etc,1,
 Stanley TheEye What we are watching is the Biden Administration and the Central Banks Vs  We the People   Even if I liquidate all of my crypto assets  I don t trust the fiat US dollar  either  It s very unsettling times we are in  In one hand the Central Banks want to destroy the confidence in crypto on the other we are on the verge of hyper inflation ,4,
The only successful crypto in China will be the digital Yuan  Why in hell do people think USA to whom the survival of a dominant dollar will allow Bitcoin which the FED does NOT control to be the successful crypto in USA    The successful crypto in USA will be the Digital Dollar or China has an automatic competitive advantage  Trade in Cryptos guys  but do not be the mug holding the bag when the Reserve Banks make their move ,2,
 LeTomato talk is cheap  don t tell us  you re free to sell right now    pull the trigger   Don t be a talkative coward in YouTube comments    no one is holding you back from selling  GO DO IT,2,
I have more confidence in crypto currency than I do in fiat currency  The only thing preventing the dollar from collapsing is by adding more liquidity by printing up more fiat to provide a false sense of security while inflation rises  People are worried about Bitcoin callapsing  and think nothing about their own dollar  Ask Venezuala ,5,
 LeTomato why do you think wealthy investors are the smartest people in the world  They re usually gambling OTHER PEOPLE s money,3,

some countries are banning it  some countries are making it legal tender  switzerland will continue to grow in the cryptocurrency field so any country that bans it is just choosing to fall behind ,1,2
you do realize stock market crash is coming    stocks are far from a safe bet,2,0
I m convinced many of the bullish crypto youtubers make more money off of clicks  ads  and likes than they do from actual crypto   The ones with the most subs don t ever really show their account balances and holdings ,117,17
 Ethan Gang How many of those shitcoin projects went to 0  80  of them   And rest are heading too  Its just like buying lottery  otherwise only a fool would see  strong fundamental  in a joke shiba coin,2,
Correct  Some even make money when you sign up to trading apps they recommend and get rolling commissions on trades as well ,4,
Exactly  No idea why people would follow Crypto YouTubers who dont even trade  I literally know not a single one except of Philakone supposedly  Although he is also very cunning and uses a lot of guile  And Im in this space since 2017  been watching like a hundred crypto YouTubers  Tell me a name and I will know who it is   ,3,
 yes crypto banter and his squad are also fun   they openly admitted many times that they buy low cap coins  or as they call them  small cap gems   then hype them up  and dump on their dumb viewership ,4,
 Ethan Gang stop with the what ifs That s like saying  if you bought this particular lottery ticket no 420 from this random store  you would be a millionaire,10,
Of course  you have to invest in coins waaaay before they start talking about any project  A serious investor would not reveal his investing strategy for free  like they do  Crypto youtube is the most hypocritical thing anyway ,2,
That s more than evident  and the majority of day and swing traders do more money coaching and giving lectures than actually trading  Many people do make money with crypto  but you have to be a knowledgeable player not just a guy with some money or you are gonna get burned big time ,4,
If you put  100 in  SHIB in January you would have around 600k at the top in 3 months,2,
Biden is literally trash  it s so sad   ,1,1
Well said ,1,1
crypto cant go to zero  there will always be at least some use case for it and that will always draw more people  bitcoin might  and maybe should  crash  but cryptocurrency is going to stay,9,4
Future of black market gold  Blood diamonds  We all know how that went down ,3,
 Bitcoin represent the new era of crypto currency which means that even if you ban it  regulate it or tax it  it s still the gate to crypto world  and the reality is that the way that human market work people who  missed  buying bitcoin at 20K USD or 10K or 1K USD they will buy bitcoin if it goes down and  crush  because they don t dig into the details like you do and they will rise the price back up again ,7,1

Of course banks hate crypto  ,15,3
 what what What you want  because it s your money ,3,
When you put money into a bank   the money is then loaned out for business  personal  and mortgage loans  and are invested   This adds to our economy    Without them no one could hardly buy a house  car  or open their own business and hire people for jobs   Where does the Bitcoin money go   What is the money doing   Nothing ,3,
I went all in     absolutely no regrets  Definitely can t compare bitcoin to aliens lol,6,2

Like wtf are you even doing trading if you end up buying everything at the top  You keep fomoing at the top basically making emotional trades and now you are spewing out some kind of wisdom like you know what you re talking about  And you keep saying things like bitcoin will go to 0 it wont just drop to 10k or whatever it has to be a zero don t you see how emotional you sound  Just keep your money on app development man trading clearly isn t for you you are way too emotional about money ,1,0

the feds can access anyones wallet         ,2,6
 RuskiVodka Thats not how it works  The blockchain is public anyone can see it  The anonymity comes in because your personal data is not tied to your address  It is also recommended not to use the same address twice to preserve anonymity  The feds can figure things out by analyzing the blockchain especially if the  exchange  gives them your info  The issue is with exchanges that are subject to KYC regulations ,2,
exactly this is a huge red flag for all of crypto  The underlying fundemantal element of it being  untracable  because of blockchain has literally been shattered  The FBI is using quantum computers it s literally the only way I can think of how they did it,1,
I love Tech lead  I love his sarcasm  I love his perspective  I actually admire him greatly  I m just done with people s        on bitcoin  If you don t like it don t f       buy it it s easy,6,1
But when someone stands there and talks bad about it all the time it s almost like they re shilling against it  In the same way that people do shill for it    Love his sarcasm though he s a funny guy and I actually greatly like his life advice and stuff about computers a lot,1,

Guys it s because Tech lead has a put option against Bitcoin so he loves spreading that fear   He s trying to get his money back from panic selling at the bottom    And while doing it  he s going to bring down everyone else too   Yes it s good to be skeptical and to not fully be in or out on anything  But God damn he s just keeps doing the clickbait titles and all this negativity   I honestly would prefer if he never talked about Bitcoin again  If he doesn t like it  That s fine he should focus on the things he does like  He should teach us about the  good things    Instead he s going to tell us to invest in Amazon or the stock market or some dumb s    like that ,7,1
The Techlead will continue making his bitcoin videos until he turns into the Asian Peter Schiff ,91,8
Bitscam needs a much larger correction for us to buy back in ,1,

He s no longer a millionaire  He panicked sold at the bottom  He s trying to get it all back from these clickbait titles,4,
What a oof,1,1
God damn techlead   I love you bro    I ve admired you for some time  But you really like milking that clickbait huh    It s almost like you re shilling for Bitcoin   EXCEPT SHILLING AGAINST BITCOIN ,1,3
Ask yourself  Why would someone who doesn t own Bitcoin spend hours producing and editing video s bashing it  I don t own AMC or GME  Why would I care what happens to the price  I don t  He is  controlled opposition  for the establishment  His job is to lie to you ,2,
