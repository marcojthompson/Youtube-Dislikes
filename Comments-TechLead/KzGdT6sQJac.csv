For a software engineer  you are very ignorant of cryptocurrency     I ll include a few paraphrases that are very off base    1   Why would people trust coinbase more than a robinhood     Robinhood does not give access to cryptocurrencies and is not a crypto exchange  you can not receive crypto from robinhood    2   You likened a facebook token  a digital  asset  to coinbase a crypto exchange and banking service   ,1,1
Thanks for the different POV,1,1

Coinbase customer service is terrible  As a new member I was absolutely shocked  They simply don t care for your issues ,2,1
Hello  I m new to forex trade and I have been making huge losses but I recently see a lot of people earning from it  Can someone please tell me what I m doing wrong,21,37
I am very excited about the prospect of using cryptocurrency  not just as a money equivalent  but using it as a way to earn something as a result of doing some type of work ,113,23
I don t think a US dollar crypto coin will be trusted by people      They just keep printing more money  and its worthless      If digital coins are minted with no limit  same effect   ,2,1
Coinbase has been in a class action suit for not giving peoples money back   They are still doing it   It took me 3 months of fighting to get my money back after they clised the suit     Who trusts them   Agreed  gov only coins until they make it a world  SDR   special drawing rights  coin controlled by groups we didn t vote for   Yippee       ,1,1
What do you think about VYGVF ,1,1
     ,1,1
What i think people will be investing on crypto companies that have real projects like CELR  and not on doge eth and btc  like stocks its like investing on companies ,1,1
Ahh it is really sad to find out people crying going down x  after 2 months  Please do not invest and cry if you are short term investor  You are big influencer  we need positive attitude  Try something like that yourself  you should have the best intel as programmer ,1,1
Coinbase is available in the uk   ,1,1
are you georg,1,1
Seems like someone is having second thoughts about selling his crypto and tries hard to get back in at a lower level ,2,1
Coinbase only needs to focus on becoming a bank so we can write checks and purchase things directly from our account and have a live Customer Service Rep available 24 hours a day  The End,2,2
I think he should change the channel s name to As a millionaire,1,1
Would Coinbase Wallet be safe or would the money disappear if Coinbase Exchange collapses ,2,1
Do bitcoiners think that the central bankers will handover their power to sushimi Nagasaki  ,1,1
I just hope I can at least break even  You re right  disastrous performance thus far  Hoping for a rally and I will pull the ejection handle ,1,1
Nah  global deflationary crypto s will be the winners  People get to choose what they accept  Nobody really wants to hold inflationary currencies ,1,1
Wow  that CEO is really not good at bullshiting compare to other CEOs  You can clearly tell that he has no idea what he is talking about during the interview,2,1
They rich see economic crisis as a garage sale also the rich stays rich by investing and diversifying their portfolio with stocks  cryptocurrency and forex trading which is the widest thing every individual need to do and it s really profiting,22,30
Adding more bag holders every day for weeks now lmao,2,1
Haha   What s this the YouTube channel for people who don t understand crypto and have hurt feelings from experience with coinbase    Aww  Poor babies     Coinbase is the first ever crypto exchange listed on the stock market   It has Prestige and those who have issues with it I probably people with issues   When crypto Winter Comes coinbase will be the refuge    Forget all you know about the customer service and focus in on how much money coinbase makes      It s almost 0 overheads  with pure profit     Remember kids you must do the opposite of what the masses are doing   Coinbase is going surprised a lot of people    Especially people who think they know everything,1,1
So what s a better alternative to Coinbase ,2,1
Interesting   I learned something,1,1
Coin base is more centralized than your traditional stock exchange  It just makes it so ironic ,2,1
I use Coinbase they are not going out of business  That s ridicule on your point ,1,1
Look into open banking and open finance in uk  There is a market for building financial infrastructure on crypto  I dont think CB is delusional to think that they will ride on hopium trading fees long term ,1,1
coinbase better list BSV lmfao,1,1
Unfortunately Im a bag holder too but This would be the easiesttttt short ever say crypto as a whole goes down ,4,1
 one single global currency  that is the dream and mantra of EVERY crypto currency  and is a completely unrealistic objective   they are all going to zero  except the central currencies,11,0
Hi  welcome  I was waiting for you      Man you are smart ,1,1
Thank you,2,1
They valuated stocks in peak of the bull cycle and they know what s coming  How ever prices will recover to some extent with  binance restrictions,1,1
Ripple the company is already ahead of Coinbase to build a CBDC and has already many of their ex employees working and advising the US govt ,1,2
Techlead is really good at educating folks on financial analysis and investments ,1,1
Coinbase to zero  If crypto dies  it has the word crypt in it for a reason  and it will  then they have nothing  And they have no hope of the US govt working with them to keep them alive  Why would they  The govt and banks want it all for themselves ,1,1
coinbase is so bad those fees are ridicoulus i think voyager will become far bigger,1,1
I don t know man  Last time you said Bitcoin will crash  yet its still going up  Now you re saying Coinbase wont last  What s next  Cryptocurrency will be irrelevant  ,8,9
 Working Tools Oh I would definitely trust Coinbase over Binance  even more so since they went public ,1,
 MarkEz DEZ He said BT will crash so he sold all of his  The next day BTC went back up  I still watch this guy on other topics but I wouldn t listen to any prediction he has with regards to alts ,2,
 This is an actual carreer not just day trading on hopium      So good  laughed hard  now back to day trading on hopium,47,0
Fantastic  Thank you for sharing your findings  I appreciate you sharing your DD like this  It saves us so much time ,3,1
I think the future is decentralizing crypto economy for people to people  Like the vision of Cardano ,1,0
Don t buy IPOs there always over priced just wait a year see if they can  deliver on there P E,2,1
look into Voyager digital brother  less risk much more upside,2,1
I 100  agree with you techlead  I had the same notion the first time I learned about crypto ,4,2
Didn t know johnny sins was the coinbase ceo,1,0
With 10 000 digital coins  none of which are as useful as USD  GBP  etc why bother with crypto ,11,5
 Frito 0 the fact that you prolly have invested  40  100 and call others poor while the op could an engineer financr guy making triple your annual income,1,
The moment crypto goes the route of a national coin then i am out ,15,4
You will have NO CHOICE  You WILL own ,1,
same the whole point n crypto was to be away from the government not to keep being controlled by them like sheep in every way  people aren t gonna be happy till every part of life needs a license or rules and regulations by daddy government including food and medicine  soon,1,
When i watch this guys videos he seems like someone that bought a bunch of BTC at 55k and now is sour ,4,2
Thats how you know youre not being rational  Your ego is invested  dominated by emotions  Techlead offers very good points that any btc investor should consider ,2,
Why would you use robinhood and a comparison to coinbase    Do you even own any crypto ,2,1
Why there will Not be a CBDC      Because Central Banks are basically Clearing houses for banks and Bedt dumps of Governments    If there is a CBDC NO BANK will Exist  there would be No NEED for Banks and hance Banks would simply disapear     no one would need to  put money on the Bank   Banks would instantly become Dinossaurs   a thing of tha past  So no  there will never be a CBDC  Also if there is a blockchain based CBDC crypto that could instantly be transfered to ANy Other Crypto without ANY control of the State ,1,0
Did you leave Facebook just to start an HR employment channel for BigTech ,1,1

DONNOT PUT YOUR MONEY IN COINBASE    THEY BLOCKED MY ACCOUNT FOR 4 WEEKS NOW FOR NO REASON AND I M STILL WAITING FOR AN ANSWER  I VE SENT 100   EMAILS AND THEY DONT ANSWER AND THEY DONT ALLOW ME TO CLOSE MY POSITIONS  SO FAR I VE LOST 40K  I WILL BE SUEING THEM SOON  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I VE EVER EXPERIENCE ,1,1

When you see Teachlead and many other channels that usually has nothing to do with crypto markets are talking about the price of bitcoin  profits  alts  etc    is time to get OUT,14,1
Literally no other channel out there offers the value that techlead offers  When he says the tech isnt living up  then its time to stop and take that argument seriously,2,
X R P saw buying at  1 31 and while this did push it up the charts  buyers were unable to topple  1 75 resistance  This led to some bearish pressure and while the 20 SMA and 50 SMA offered some support  there was a chance of a further breakdown  Awesome Oscillator noted the said bearish pressure and a move below the half line could indeed lead to an unfavorable outcome  Tradlng volumes across exchanges showed muted activity and a pr ce hike was off the table at least over the coming sessions  Instead  focus would be on different support lines  A southbound move from  1 53 support would see X R P head towards another defensive line at  1 45  Another strong region of support resided at  1 31 and around the 200 SMA  OBV has been on a steady uptrend since late April and buying pressure would likely counter any move below the long term moving average  I have used  services from many s gnal providers  but Edward James stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favor  I must confess it wasn t an easy task to learning the routes on tradlng but with the assistance of Edward it was easier to understand  Bryant is an expert trader and finance journalist and you can find his free courses on tradlng on google which comes in handy as an  nvestor and he can be reached on             Edwardjames022 for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related concerns ,39,7
 To invest is g00d  but investing with the right person matters  Thanks Edward ,1,
Definitely I will be among the richest in world soon  as long am still working with Edward James,1,
Doge coin millionaires  where yall at  Got 50000 coins at 5 cents  and I m holding until I m a millionaire  Thanks Edward for the early info ,1,
Edward is one of the best in the crypto market  I was able to recover my loss with his strategy during the fall and his daily signals are 100  viable  It was very easy compared to other programs i have used in the past ,1,
My mum w s so mad at me when I told her I invested  230 000 with Edward  you sho uld see her reaction the day she saw my pr0fits from him,1,
It worth the risk  I was totally nervous  but thanks to Edward James  i have made it big,1,
When I first started working with Edward  he predicted that I should invest in Binance coins which I did  I deposited about  120 000 coin then  now is all up  thanks to Edward James  I can never forget you man,1,
It is a very simple trading logic  you buy into ipo with hype your money gone  You are definitely not intelligent  and the lowest abandoned software engineer from alibaba,1,1
The other crypto coins will certainly follow this trend  The problem is that all crypto coins are too instable  Too much value variation through time decreases stability of coin    Also  with the majority of them  you cant trade it to real money     so you cant buy or sell anything    That s why almost none of them have some kind of use in market  so they will not endure much longer    Not worth the investment ,4,1
They are a giant fee trap ,1,1
The future of money is decentralized finance where we act as the bank and median of exchange rather than central exchanges like coinbase  the banks  and the government  Governments can ban cryptocurrency all they want  but eventually money supply exponential expansion will need to be reset and value must be accrued elsewhere to curb inflation ,1,1
Coinbase is very well installed in Europe and almost the only crypto exchange that is well regulated and  appreciated  by banks  This is indeed the best bridge between the old and the new system  However  this is a very bad disappointing exchange  with very little choice   But the best European bridge ,2,1
A crypto or token connected to a government   what is that   A hedge to depreciating its own currency,1,0
No TimeStamps   ,1,1
Is it really necessary to put  as a millionaire  in all of these titles  Like bro  We get it  You re ballin  lmao ,2,0
 Hey welcome  I ve been waiting for you  xD,8,1
I guess the view of coinbase is probably to become the Stripe of payments using cryptocurrencies  That said they are not very clear at explaining it ,9,0
I do not agree that in the future all tokens  that are not connected with the government will be useless  There are platforms like Binance or smart contracts on Ethereum allowing NFT  or platforms for decentralized computations and storage won t disappear overnight  They will survive in one form or another because they fulfill real needs ,1,0
They are no different than any discount broker  No moat ,2,0
I bet that ceo is crumbling on the inside,2,1
The advantage of having a major public exchange is to be a sink for fiat currency   As for the number of coins these would and will always be made and traded ,3,1
They didn t do a traditional IPO so when it came on the market it dumped ,2,1
Really great thoughts,2,1
My problem with Coinbase is they have no leverage so I can t buy high nor sell low and liquidate even faster ,49,5
Coinbase is for people who don t understand care why bitcoin was invented while simultaneouasly trying to profit off it  They will only last as long the hypetrain takes to run out gas with the mindset you highlighted ,9,1
AND COULD YOU BUT WOULD YOU scare everyone into selling so you can buy  wait your just an honest man  WAHT  ,1,0
why are you always at loss lmao ,1,0
Why buy Coinbase stock  Eventually it will have to move to 0  fees to be competitive  There s so many better alternatives  binance  kucoin  huobi  hoo  gate io  uphold  etc   Just buy Bitcoin  Life will be much simpler   Edit  any bots who   me will be reported ,2,1
You being a shareholder of this dump shows your level of stupidity ,2,1
Xrp brah  coinbase  vision  is literally the definition of what xrp does   yet they de listed it  I agree with this guy coinbase   has no vision,3,1
I truly believe that  as a whole  government is inept  Politicians  bureaucrats and their staffs are not the brightest turnips in the crop  why do they gravitate towards these careers of last resort     working for the state  living off the taxpayers dime they will eventually create laws with outside assistance  never fully understanding what they have voted on  and never actually care enforce them as they are written    but as far as overall technological prowess  they are hopelessly behind in every conceivable way ,2,1
This guy is so full of FUD,3,1
I was recommended this video a lot of time ,16,1
Wrong   when smart contracts will run  stocks and all other assets will be on it   so if Coinbase will build NASDAQ 2 0 that would work    The only concern here will be liquidity,2,1
Even if every BANK uses a CBDC its like digital form of money now   We aren t going to be speculating the U S  CBDC is going to 1 million  or appreciating   It s going to be a stagnant inflated currency online that is just easier to move around   There is no fun in that ,2,1
Damn this guy is quite pessimistic lmao,13,7
 sirus312 The barrier to entry is low yes but the demand for it is also low,1,
 sirus312 This reminds me of when people were shitting on flying cars  One day   we ll show them  ,2,
 Henry Didelot bitcoin to zero  coinbase to zero  meanwhile everyone in the space builds products and ignores the doomsayers,1,
Pessimistic  or realistic ,4,
I don t agree  Coinbase is not going to become big  it is just one of the many crypto exchanges  CBDT  central bank digital token  are just bank accounts that people is going to have directly at the central banks  Just a database kept there  No need for coinbase ,3,1
Biggest disaster is a ROBLOX buy puts when you can,3,1
coinbase sucks  they want me to pay 571USD in miners fee to move 30  of USDC to Trust Wallet   i used Binance and Bittrex and they do not have that fee ,2,1
The whole point of decentralized crypto is to remove middle men like coinbase  or robinhood  or any of these other entities that profit off of our transactions or holdings   The whole point is to be or operate your own bank ,19,21
 Henry Didelot not only that  The ledger weights like 500gb  You have to connect to a node  which also diminishes decentralisation  Crypto can t exist in current world  and governments began to understand it  It s value is 70  institutional hodling speculating  25  money laundering and 5  dark net drug market transactions ,1,
 Henry Didelot Yeah  but Bitcoin has failed at what it was invented for  to be currency ,1,
 Engage Intellect Except the exchanges are able to be shut down by the government overnight  That s not my definition of decentralized,1,
99  of crypto transactions take place through exchanges though  Seems like Bitcoin failed at that objective,1,
thats why all these cryptos are switching to staking instead of mining  They want to be able to track you,2,
in a few months or no time people we definitely be kicking themselves regret for missing the opportunity to buy or invest in cryptocurrency ,8,2
 Patrick              forex with margins is gambling  without it can be great  crypto is future because those stocks also will be on blockchain very soon,1,
I definitely don t agree with you  Just bc China is banning Crypto  doesn t mean everyone will follow  It would be like saying  since China is a communist country  every country will become communist as well ,1,1
I have been programming for 20  years  and then I interviewed with Coinbase  phone coding interview  They asked a lady that was out of college for 1 year to interview me   So I finished the problem  It worked 100   and the next thing they told me was they were not going to move forward  Why would that be   Why waste our time   Was she looking for somebody who d flatter her more or was I not enough of a Justin Bieber for her ,2,0
What do think Ripple is doing ,1,1
Most experts in cryptos would have told you getting into Coinbase was not a good time  Still thumbs up on this video  Like to hear your insight as it helps me understand what these sellers are thinking ,15,2
ExPeRts,1,
issue 1 i see is they are not regulated yet   they have NO idea whats coming down the pike   I guess thats why he met with Pelosi   But either way  they cant handle any volume spikes and lock their customers out   Kraken does the same  I dont know what they plan to do here but the fact that its about exapnsion before perfection is basically cearal box crypto selling because they use NICE colors  and make this stuff look so easy and simple with commerical after commercial on Youtube and and others places      meanwhile the double jerk off is that you have to compete WITH COINBASE themselves to buy   sell when if there is market spike OR dump   I would Hold   wait for another  better platform that s  issueless  for their paying  KYC d and approved customers  ,1,0
      ,2,1
Sir how are you  Im from the Philippines  What do you think of Polkadot  I know its out of the topic from your video but I just had to ask       God bless you sir ,2,1
next video   why I m not a millionaire ,7,3
Lmao this guy is the biggest doomer out there,1,
yes  there will be a one world coin   it s bound to happen ,6,1
Your videos historically have been accurate and useful   This one unfortunately you have made quite a few errors and have missed some major points especially with respect to Bitcoin s future and therefore Coinbase s income and reach   Bitcoin being really the only asset that has mattered for Coinbase      Coinbase are the most highly regulated and trusted exchange even here in the UK   Thousands of people have been burned by unregulated exchanges   We are currently going through a  casino  phase in crypto with unregulated exchanges allowing trading on leverage     this will be slowly regulated out of the system   its a near  zero sum game for the participants with the only benefits being   the house   and the winner will be companies like Coinbase who have done things properly in the first place ,1,0
Just by looking at your titles you have terrible picks and paper hands   but hey to each is own,2,1
My experience with buying stock  never buy at launch date  Always get slaughtered  I rather lose out and wait until I can establish a chart pattern trend ,65,3
 TheFirstSeed I got screwed before a few times  It s part of the journey  Only with pain  we remember the lesson for life and avoid doing the same mistake,4,
at 18 this was the first time I ve invested in a company at launch  My lost   ,4,
I got my butt kicked buying that at ipo  It lost like  60 per share the first 30 minutes  Luckily I got scared and when it went up some sold at a loss  And today it s still way lower than I paid,7,
I don t understand how you have any money left  Whenever I see your videos recommended you ve either lost your job  lost money through investing or getting a divorce  I don t know how you do it well done,7,4
You know YouTube pays very well if you have the numbers    But well he has no idea how to invest at all  D,1,
Look up wyckoff distribution and you will understand much better ,1,1
Go back to your divorce and simp videos  Everyone in YouTube is a crypto expert now that  got in  Bitcoin in 2015 ,2,1
Hi Fantastic Anillas  Thanks for your Conclusishion ,1,1
Coinbase did direct listing  not IPO,2,1
Facebook already has a payment system in Messenger like the one the CEO of coinbase is aspiring for  lol,1,1
I love how you give out your opinions despite the haters  or people that disagree with you   It is one of the reasons why I am subscribed to you   ,1,1
no coffee time today  Im shocked,2,1
With no intentions of undermine your effort  but these are all predictions and doesn t require guarantee growth from  45k 330k in few months  I have about  76k set asides to invest and I could appreciate quality investment advice ,32,9
 investorparker,5,
 Anna grace How do I get in touch with the coach you use ,2,
 Anna grace How is it going so far with your coach  are you having a much better experience ,2,
 Sebastian Daniel With the current uncertainties in the market  investing solely based on prediction would be a fool s errand  I personally had to get in touch with a coach to better navigate the market ,4,
 Wasp             I think this is fake,3,
You better off getting in touch with a real time coach or professional ,5,
Tech lead do a video on cardano ,1,0
Coimbase just admitted that cryptos are essentially worthless     Better short Buttcoin ,1,0
Coinbase is good for newbies,1,1
Your click bait  as a millionaire  is outta control   Usually I m like  I want to know what TechLead thinks about X or Y     but not on crypto ,1,0
How does someone like this even get 1m subscribers on YouTube ,2,1
Because he s a ex Facebook ex Google ex Husband  soon to be ex millionaire  ,1,
well  in China we use alipay which is way better than wechat pay  but i think google recently released their new google pay  interested in your class lol   ,1,0
Hey it s me Techlead  ex Facebook  ex Google  and almost ex Coinbase,1,0
every company is trying to be like Humbl  HMBL in 100  countries   crypto ETX   P2P   currency exchange    ticketing  NFT   finTech solutions  ,1,0
Be careful posting this type of video  Coinbase s boss is probably Agent 47 ,1,0
doing more research before sell vs doing research before buy,1,0
Honestly I m just glad he s still using  as a millionaire  it s a relief,4,3
Hey  Michael  aka Techlead   do you remember me  I m steve  your grade school mate  Even after so many years yours weirdness has not gone  Do you remember Shalie  She is married and having two kids  I know you dig hard in high schools days ,1,0
I love your videos  Thank you,1,0
Hey Michael  aka TechLead   how is your ex wife doing ,1,0
XRP pretty much sums up your last few minutes,3,0
Coinbase is still way overvalued based on no earnings and their  low sales   regardless of how crypto works ,3,0
Why does Silicon Valley sounds like a place of lunatics instead of a promised land at times ,8,0
will not work happen,1,0
Coinbase exchange will fail not because of CBDC  but because decentralized exchanges like Uniswap will take over the entire market  Failing to address decentralized exchanges in this video is a clear sign that Techlead still has a lot to learn ,3,0
Getting the basics of how the market works is vital  You LEARN and then remove the  L  to EARN  However  to be profitable with the market  you need a mentor and who can show you how to learn at a faster rate and at the same time earn in the process ,3,0
Total respect for you but claiming Bitcoin going to Zero so why invest in Coinbase  Kinda contradicting,3,1
Forget about regulations  central banks etc   as someone who doens t live in the US coinbase is just not attractive whatsoever  because their fee is just too expensive compared to other wallets,3,0
i cant see individual governments trusting it and allowing it to compete against their own digital currency  They simply wont allow crypto to grow to the astronomic predictions presented in the 100  not paid for content we ve seen all over the internet  Some might say crypto is too powerful to stop  however  China has banned it and other countries could if they feel it goes against their national interests  It is easy to say well China bans everything  facebook  google ect   however  bitcoin was very popular with members of the CCP and it is likely that there are reserves of recently mined bitcoin that need to be shifted  It might just be china that bans it  however if smaller more liberal economies start to ban it then i might lead to a domino effect ,1,0
Coinbase is horrible  I received response from their support after 3 months lol ,1,0
I am a Norwegian citizen and live in Norway  Coinbase closed my account for no reason and they kept my money for a month  only after many emails I could get back my money ,1,1
You should invest on Magnus Carlsen  ,1,
While pushing his own platform he has the unique way of words to kill various quant people   and day traders   my god   he s an amazing person  ,1,0
So what you re saying is that the Coinbase CEO should focus on becoming the federal bank equivalent of crypto  Interesting concept  and I approve    ,1,0
Wow  as much as I like the TechLead     he really doesn t get crypto  Like AT ALL   That said  Clownbase is going down ,2,1
He is either lying for views because crypto is the hot thing right now or he s smart when it comes to starting businesses and corporate psychology but absolutely terrible at trading and understanding crypto ,1,
I strongly agree  No country will give their financial independence to an unknown Tech company ,6,0
People been saying bitcoin will go to ZERO since it was at 6 cents lol  remember these you tubers get paid for views and this is click bait to the max,1,0
 Single  centralized  government regulated digital currency    Not exactly an adrenaline rush  But then again neither is water  it just works rather well ,12,1
Fiat currencies work rather well too   ,1,
Best thing in this video is that there is keyboard pr0n   The dollar did not prevent gold to exist even if they tried hard   So same with CBDC and Bitcoin ,2,0
I have been waiting for a laugh    When will you dump your Coinbase shares  Remember that you buy high and sell low      ,6,1
Techlead is now Cryptolead  the master of coin,4,3
I saw his ethereum dump kinda video  He tried to convince everyone to not to believe in eth  Okay why did buy ethereum in the first place when it had soo many negative impacts  And calling vitalik     Hahahaha  Why u soo proud to be ex google there are over 100k employees in google  Stop it man,1,0
Coinbase to the ground  ,2,1
Agree with your analysis  every government would want to protect monetary policy and all currency digital or otherwise would be regulated  Am in Kenya and we have had mobile money for nearly a decade  the government has been continually increasing regulation on it  The govt here has been warning against crypto too ,1,2
well  techlead is proof sometimes smart people cannot find success in investing,55,5
 Michael Ellis it s in bad taste IMO to be talking to hundreds of thousands of strangers about your recent relationship on a channel that is supposed to focused on tech  I would not appreciate it if I was the ex partner,1,
He puts  as a millionaire  in every other video title and flaunts his resume as compared to vitalik buterins to pump he ego  I am not convinced he is actually all that smart  especially when he brings up his failed relationship all the time   which seems rude to the ex partner,1,
to be fair 90  loose money  but he is unleashing hell on cryptos lmao,2,
you ve been waiting for me  ,29,2
It s kind of sweet to hear that  isn t it ,3,
Ha   hopeium  noice one   Def gonna help spread that one,10,1
Your insights on data tracking with digital currencies are very interesting and something I had not considered ,1,1
You talk about not letting emotions influence trading but you always get bearish after you ve suffered losses  Also you say day trading isn t a  real  career but this is once again probably because you have failed to be profitable continuously ,4,1
Hello again Compadre Robinhood is All but done  TOASTED,1,1
You ignore the individusl privacy and liberty of the individual   ,2,1

no hard feelings  except you probably lost multi million dollars by getting turned away from coinbase ,1,1
There was just too much hype and we were dealing with huge inflation fear  I knew it would definitely go down below 300  When it hit 250  I started a small position  and I was averaging down until 220   My average is 240 now and I am happy with my decision and the position I m currently in  I do like the company and I am planning to hold it for the long term ,2,1
One question   how is the E Yuan or E Dollar difference from the current fiat currencies   Those Yuan and Dollars are going to be on a  centralized  block chain that is backed by the central banks of the respective nations  So the only difference with the current cash based fiat system payment systems and the central bank digital currencies  Nothing   ,1,0

I  like you  planned to buy during IPO but once I saw the share price which valued the company at above  100B I pulled off  Coinbase is massively overvalued  The share price reflects what the company could become   there is really no incentive to make profit out of it at this price  Tech Lead  you  really  should know better ,1,0

Yes this global currency is too idealistic  Currency is one of a country s main weapon of control and security  there s no way they d let a private company from the USA get a piece of that  Stable coins and CBDCs will be the future  These peer to peer cryptocurrencies would be forever niche  like for small internet transaction type of purchases like subscription NFTs and that sort  That idea may not be as sexy as currency of the world currency of the people BUT as long as governments exists  they will want FULL CONTROL of their financial systems  China is the most technologically progressive country in the world  watch what they do  as most countries would follow that if they can  The power to tweak your country s economy by the cent and trace illegal activities and put money on the right place at the right time is the single biggest innovation in macro economy in history  and CBDCs would bring that ,1,1

I don t really agree with you on the fact that cryptocurrencies are going to zero  Just like currently the dollar has gold as store of value  Bitcoin will be the gold for CBDCs  it doesn t even need to be necessarily Bitcoin  it might be a different crypto asset in the future  nobody knows for sure  The second reason why i think crypto is not going to zero is because governments are slow on development and CBDCs underlying technology might be obsolete in a couple years decades while in the meantime other companies constantly upgrade and come up with newer innovations to their blockchains and technology overall  Let s not nerf the huge potential and progress of crypto as a whole by trying to convince people that it will go to zero  it will not  Support the legitimately amazing projects  just take a look at Cardano for example ,1,0
I agree that Coinbase fee is too high and very slow with transferring fund back to our accounts but it will not only survive  it will thrive just because it s the dominant player  Crypto also will not be going away either  many of these companies has real technology that are very useful ,4,1

Oh man this guy literally makes the argument for Bitcoin while trying to say it s all going to fail  He argues Coinbase is screwed because of global regulations but this is why Bitcoin is great  it s already global  whether or not you use a local exchange to sell or not  There s plenty of peer to peer selling and buying already  It just shows he hasn t actually thought all this out very deeply or is ignorant about the technology that already exists that makes regulations obsolete and ridiculous ,2,1

Hey real advice  Don t invest in just one thing and be able to consider multiple points of view  Crypto dropped a bit  and if you belive in its future it could be a good buying opportunity  I like ETH the most because NFTs are done in ethereum generally which is a real  popular  use   BUT your whole portfolio or savings should not be in crypto  Even if you belive in it that is a naive move and massively exposes your life savings  Having your money split up between different  unrelated assets is  diversification  and critical to protect your hard earned cash  also all professional investors do it  For example  every paycheck you can choose and amount to invest and split it between 5 20 things  too many is hard to follow  too little lacks diversity     For example  you could put 25  in crypto and crypto related stocks  another 25  in a few high dividend safe stocks like GLDI  12  returns per year basically guaranteed   25  in index funds  S P following like SPY  or China following like CHIX   and save 25  as cash or for what ever else suites your fancy stock wise    Just my two cents  Fast money is an illusion  doing this is how you get rich slowly and find yourself financially happy down the road  ,2,
Very volatile  If you re into risk  go for it  Just make sure you at least study and understand what you re getting yourself into,1,
Please don t listen to tech lead on this  he himself said he failed to get the job at coinbase  Look up bitboy crypto or eliotradescrypto they have been in the space a long time and know much more about these subjects than tech lead  He s bringing up points that there are answers to and easily solvable through blockchain  He s researching using traditional methods and crypto is already revolutionizing its own space  Crypto is not like the stock market or general tech  It s something completely new  I wish you the best of luck,2,
I would start from understanding what actually is cryptocurrency and what is their use  Don t jump into something just because someone told you you can make money out of it ,1,
 Saat Anyone watching techleads and coming out the other side saying he  knows nothing about the space  knows nothing about the space ,1,
 Saat you re giving advice to a fake account  It s a spam comment ,1,
First of all  Don t use Coinbase  that exchange is terrible and should only be a last option  Opt for Binance  If you want to learn everything about crpyto  go to a Youtube channels like  Coin Bureau   if you want to learn how to buy and safely store crypto  search a channel called  Every bit Helps   And also bonus channel    sub to Davincij15 for daily updates on the BTC price and market  He has the most experience in this space and has had the most accurate predictions so far  Stay away from channels like BitBoy  he will lose you money if you listen to him ,6,

With all due respect TechLead I think you ve vastly oversimplified cryptocurrencies  DLT and the future of currency  CDBCs are going to be one niches within the crypto sphere and future of currency  and yes  most governments will have their own CDBCs  along with banks   but that s not to say that other niches of crypto are merely going to disappear or get absorbed into solely CBDC s  which wouldn t technically make sense   niches like Defi  with its countless use cases   NFTs  derivatives  commodities and much  much more that is already here and coming to the broader space     I think you ve also broadly overstated Coinbase s mission which is not to provide the world with a single currency but rather a platform to bank the unbanked and provide people a single pane of glass to access the future of currency  Also to assume that Coinbase doesn t have any strong leads on other countries is a wide estimation that is purely conjecture  meaning I think your argument is baseless if you re basing it on a few quotes you heard from Haas  which I think you contextually misinterpreted   Furthermore  comparing Facebook s Diem with Coinbase USDC  which you did not specifically state USDC   I am assuming this  is an inaccurate comparison considering Coinbase is not trying to globalize USDC as its sole project but rather offer it is a better alternative to other stablecoins like USDT   offer countless other crypto projects including their own Coinbase Cloud  which I believe will be equivalent to BSC     Another point I disagree with you on is the  safer  aspect of Coinbase  which you have failed to mention that they re one of the only exchanges that is insured and will reimburse their user s if Coinbase is hacked  and not due to user error   Also they tout a rather large cybersecurity team and spend a significant portion of their internal funds on security  What makes Coinbase unique in this aspect is that they haven t completely sacrificed user experience for security  albeit you couldn t tell from some of the comments below  but overall MOST people have very good experiences with Coinbase and its those who do not that get the press coverage  That being said they are by far the easiest platform to use for purchasing crypto and considering the majority of crypto users have no idea how to buy trade on advanced marketplaces  like Coinbase PRO  that alone makes it easily the most applicable and efficient marketplace currently available  to the US at least     You stating that Coinbase provides  a bunch of random tokens  is again an oversimplification of the various use cases  partnerships  technologies and overall goals of these projects  For example ADA   Cardano is partnered with multiple governments in Africa for developing secure identification via education systems  Ethiopia  and internet networking infrastructure  Tanzania  Take ALGO   Algorand   for example who is partnered with The Marshall Islands to run their CDBCs on the Algorand blockchain  Other companies like VET   VeChain are partnered with multiple government entities for improving supply chain management for various industries  The list goes on and on with such diverse use cases where projects are partnered with both private  public and government entities for the countless benefits of DLT    I humbly respect your opinion but I think you re a bit to black and white when it comes to what s actually going on in crypto and where its headed    Always your fan  Mark,2,0

I wanna share a negative experience on coinbase with paypal withdrawal  Most people who s national currency is not the dollar should never transfer dollars to their bank account to a different foreign currency bank  The reason is there are currency exchange fees  different recovery procedure and you will loose roughly up to 5  of your money  Also  Paypal has one of worst customer service and you might never reach them because they don t care at all  Coinbase is being very people in Europe which I believe will bring more EU government to ban or take a deeper look into the topic ,1,1

To answer your last question  It is naive  I come from a 30 financial background having to deal with banks and governments  If coinbase would  support  a CBDC they would lose most of their customers as most crypto HODLers are completely against a CBDC  Besides that  the FED would never team up with coinbase  they already have the CBDC ready and are just waiting for the right time to roll it out  UBI has been the first step  Wait till the focus shifts from covid to  financial crisis   then its an easy game for the world banks  Drop me DM for more details  Cheers ,2,0

I disagree  We re still very early in the crypto space    It s going to have major relevance in Africa over the next 10 15 years  So here s the deal    Coinbase just added a regulatory markets guru in ex Goldman Sachs alum Faryar Shirzad  That s a big deal  But also  institutional investment in Coinbase is only around 12   True mainstream adoption would mean 80  or so institutional investment           So you could bet that Coinbase is going to see 6 5x improvement in stock price over the next 5 7 years   even greater as you project further into the future   I also think that Tech Lead s analysis only considers issues around a laymen s version of economics  respectfully     And as a guy with an Economics degree  I will be the first to tell you that the real world doesn t work in a theoretical vacuum  obviously     In the financial system and at the highest levels of business  the long term viability of major corporations is significantly correlated to the future strategic importance of said company  And ultimately  it s clear that the global financial industrialists will find a useful role for Coinbase to play in monetary system    So  I m long Coinbase  I m long Facebook  And I m entirely comfortable allocating most of my securities portfolio to these two companies  What I will say though  is that given the volatility in the crypto space  it wouldn t be wise to fall into the trap of being extremely levered              So  my own personal risk policy is to always  keep some dry powder available  With cash reserves you can react in real time and buy dips  you can hedge with different options strategies to offset market moves against your positions  and you can avoid margin calls  For what it s worth ,1,0

The biggest problem in the crypto sphere is the crazy amount of naive people who actually  wholeheartedly believe the future of money is some decentralized  coin  or  token   Its not even realistic that it will be used in one country  but they even believe that we will have one global  decentralized currency   How exactly is that gonna happen with Central Banks in the game and also the obv fact that most people  outside the very few people invested in crypto who actually care about and understand the tech behind the projects  want centralized governence and regulation   I just dont understand how anyone can be this naive to how the real world actually works ,7,0

Man  keep em videos coming  I love how you express your ideas  They re very practical and sensible  Which is rare in CEOs and CFOs who are riddled with corporate issues   I think you re right  Central bank digital currency is the future  It might take a decade or so for gov ts to catch up  but it ll come    I also find it peculiar why major financial corporations haven t started doing this yet  like visa mastercard citibank  Maybe their CEOs are idiots and just dont believe in a technocratic future ,2,0

Thanks for sharing these at this time  This guy s like the only honest person in this scene at the moment  The digital stuff has a deep structural issue  It all runs as much of the power structure with advertising  except through digital coins you have a surveillance grid issue  So CBDC and Crypto are bad because the architecture of the system is coming from the power structure  They re all crooks  But they re the hand that feeds everything right now so it  puts the world in a very strange place  I m not sure we ll have the choice to make since the businesses just own earth at the moment  essentially we ll spend our days fighting off the choice they make  Sad that mankind has used organized efforts to make so many problems for his fellow man  life should be more than fighting for your life against your own species  you d think ,2,0

Cry out to God  Some people are living a worldly lifestyle  suiting their own dreams  goals  and desires  Some people also live with depression  fear  and anxiety which makes their lives very troubled  but if you are humble and cry out to Jesus  and repent    which means to reject evil  and turn away from your sins in your heart fully  then he will hear you  speak to you  and help you  But you have to put Jesus first in your life  and seek a relationship with Him  then you will come to know His voice  You need to be willing to open your heart to the love of Christ  IN JESUS YOU WILL FIND SALVATION AND PEACE   Blessings  Shalom   ,1,

 Eric Michel U must be blind bro all you just said goes for euro dollar or any other currency aswel  and yet we still use it  They might be bigger but they only exist because we trust in it and that did not magically happen  I do agree crypto is very risky tho and noone know what the future holds ,1,
It s best he leaves these up  Think about how much of our history on this planet has been lost already ,1,
Hes waaay wrong on these last few vids hes trying to gain subscribers,2,
Well  he clearly makes a very strong argument why it is going to zero eventually  What is the argument for why this won t happen   When I look at the argument for why that won t happen  well there is no argument other than this irrational faith and belief that people will just keep bidding it up  We already know these crypto currencies are being manipulated by funny money and ridiculous amounts of leverage  and we know that governments hate it because they cannot regulate it and are working on their own versions  There is no question he is right  the only question is how much longer can these Ponzi scams go on for  and who will be left holding the bag when it all falls apart   People are so driven by greed seeing all this easy money being made or this  fight the power ideology  they can t help but want to get in on it  To the point they refuse to see the writing is already on the wall  Or they know they can create another frenzy to drive the price up yet again and then cash out before it all falls apart leaving the average investor holding the bag yet again ,7,
  Roopak Yeah  that or the extreme opposite end    How I was absolutely right about crypto  as a millionaire    This is TechLead s pro move   In any case  this channel has already attracted a lot of viewers due to crypto related sensationalism  We may find a lot more crypto vids in the coming weeks months ,7,

Well  I bought right when public trading started  and I bailed at the first deep  down red candlestick and lost a few hundred bucks   Whew    Coinbase  being a  direct offering  had no lockup period   That should have been a flag if I had understood it then    The insiders can start selling immediately  and I ll bet they did   I would if I were them    I think Coinbase will eventually hit bottom and find a future    Cathie Wood is buying a lot right now for ARKK  and crypto currency is a sort of cult which I think will revive itself over and over regardless of logic   So we ll see  but one thing I ve learned the hard way is that if you buy into something  the moment you see you were wrong  swallow hard and bail as quickly as you can ,3,3

Reasons to avoid Coinbase  Always puts your account in review  Bad customer service  High transaction fees  Goes down when there s a crash so you can t sell or scoop a juicy dip    Literally use ANYTHING but Coinbase  Worst exchange ever ,171,22
 Crypto is ModernDigitalGoldRush from ShovelSellers already exists  wootrade,1,
coinbase is beyond their exchange  people cna transact with purchases at grocery store now with their crypto visa card  This is just the start of something big with transactions not with crypto but actual purchases in stores  You guys are simple minded about coinbase its funny  The exchange is really not that big of a deal  There is tons of exchanges but they don t have the ecosystem coinbase is building ,1,
I agree terrible customer services ,1,
 imahalo123 Spending a 6K on Coinbase  I can earn  120 passively on my bitcoin from 2 0  interest just sitting doing nothing on Gemini  Coinbase needs to get with the program  it is lagging behind the other brokerages ,3,
 Crypto is ModernDigitalGoldRush from ShovelSellers Just use Coinbase Pro my guy  The fees are not bad  two weeks ago I bought 6k of a project and the fee was only 20 something  Thats pretty good considering I spent a lot of money on it  The fees for spending a few hundred bucks on something are somewhere around 10 bucks  It s not that bad ,1,
Somebody NEEDS to create the Robinhood of Crypto to disrupt this industry  All these fees are getting out of hands  All we need is just one fee free crypto brokerage  then the rest will follow  but we will then already have loyalty to the first ,5,
Imagine not using Coinbase Pro ,3,
As a former Coinbaser  there is no point in using Coinbase or any crypto brokerage that doesn t pay interests on you bitcoin  like BlockFi  Voyager  or Gemini  Coinbase s fees don t justify the lack of support  Robinhood  I m okay with poor support thanks to commission free trading  but Coinbase  heck no ,3,
 Coin Prophets coinbase is my dad so     ,2,
  David It s the only exchange that s always given me problems  Never had issues with Binance  Uphold  Gemini ect  when ever I buy Coinbase are just incompetent  One look at reddit or twitter will show you how many people have their funds still locked up on their exchange with no support for 2 months what so ever  Luckily for me  I stopped using them as a main exchange   And it s no surprise why nobody even has that much faith in their company to buy in to the stock  The company needs better leadership than Brain Armstrong     And not entirely sure what that last remark was all about  selling at the bottom   I m a long term hodler silly boy  lol You d think I d spoke badly about someone s dead parent  the way they get so defensive over some of these companies ,9,
I use Coinbase Pro and its been fine   there was only one instance where I wasn t able to buy a dip because of a system crash  I ve bought lots of other dips with no issues ,2,
I made it for a recurring investment in ada and eth still up in profits,2,
I have not ever had issues    Never had to contact support so idk   Fees are everywhere   Every exchange has problems when things are going crazy up or down   This is why youbuse multiple exchanges    I swear the people that sold bottom really are showing lately lol    But still  ,18,
