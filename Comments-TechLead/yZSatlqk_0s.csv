If you got all this money and mad programming skills why don t you spend the coming 10years in Japan close to your son  giving him the father figure every son needs  Isn t that the real responsibility you signed up for when he was born  Every day away from him is at his expense ,1,1

Never seen a more lonely guy in my entire life ,1,2
I think you d kill it in stand up comedy   yolo,1,1
I think your humor is priceless Main reason I just love watching   But honestly I think you re speaking about some real values in many videos too  It s in between the lines but I think don t be afraid to emphasize that to your audience     ,1,1
That ending was hilarious   the amount of confusion when balancing work and play is a true struggle in itself  It just sounds like you should do van life or stay at resorts far away from big cities,6,1
You re a joke and your channel is dead,2,1
Your wife wouldn t have been happy moving back in with your parents  Good thing she left you,1,1

Your video is simply perfect and so irresistible  something I would love to always watch everyday    You are the best      Fully watched      ,1,1

Yep  the wealthy do live differently   Instead of paying for it  they get paid for their therapy  by Youtube    Well i guess you must also be smart to conduct your own therapy  Lol ,1,1
Idk but i love listening watching his vids at late night not at day  but night   ,1,1

You re so self conscious  yah sometimes it means knowledge but most of the times it s a curse  You re rich but you don t know how to use it for joy,1,0
Why the hell does YouTube shows me this channel  This guy has zero social skills  hence no gf and living with his parents  and just whines about everything  Get out there into the real world  You give tech professionals a bad rap ,1,1
Just sums up the growing number of lonly men out there  Things are not really fun without some type of human interaction,1,1
U need to find purpose in life  U seem lost  U should meditate to have some mental clarity ,1,0
This guy made the same video 1 year ago i found it on recommendations     ,1,0
You know everyone needs company sometime  move back home  your a grown man you can go out and do stuff whenever you want  Staying by yourself too much can make you lonely  but also can make you selfish  cause your not caring about anyone  At least at home  you can cook a meal for your parents  or take the rubbish out  or water the garden  or just talk  that stops you from being absorbed in just yourself and caring about others  you might say I did that I lost my wife and kid  but you can t stop life  you have to forgive and keep moving forward  and learn to trust again ,1,1
For some reason  I can t stop watching ,2,1
just lease for a month or two lol,1,1

Why wouldn t you just get an airbnb for a whole month ,1,1
No one wonders why a millionaire is always complaining about internet instead of paying for a good internet plan for the phone and using it as a router  He even says he was willing to go to we work for that  ,1,1
This guy is treating having fun like work  that has to be streamlined and optimized  Wouldn t it be more efficient to just work all the time without all this unnecessary  fun  stuff ,2,1
His ex wife is truly the final boss in his life as it threw him on this never ending spiral to find true happiness and stability again ,1,2

Thank you for at least trying and showing your audience what would actually happen if you moved out of your parent s home  I feel enlightened and less salty about what could have been  Whatever the hell it was suppose to be  this is it  I appreciate the honesty and transparency  Now  we all know what could have been isn t exactly what everyone thought it would be like ,6,1
They ve invented airbnb,1,1
Having stable parents you can lean on is such a blessing that a lot of people take for granted,102,3
This is the wisest decision you have ever made this year,1,1

As someone else already said  you could get a room in Japan and visit your son on the weekends    I dont know context of your situation but just putting it out there      ,1,1
I don t know why  but your matter of fact storytelling style cracks me up   You are so real about your analysis of moving around and  devolving  to a motel in the middle of nowhere ,68,1

 Hahaha  3 Days out of your parent s place and you can t handle the bills  Must be hard being a millionaire     Meanwhile  where do you post the videos you take on hikes and touring about  those would be very interesting ,1,1

Dude your in my back yard hahaaa I can t even make this up   You re effing killing me bro too funny  ,3,1
Now you need to isolate yourself in a safer place BEFORE moving back to your parents place ,2,1

Gotta make nice with the housekeeping staff to get plenty of room coffee packets  Also choose hotel chains which have 24 hour coffee in the lobby ,4,1
  ,1,1
go home and book a trip with some friends instead next time,2,1
dude  buy some friends of rent some hookers  your life seems depressing,1,1
Hey TL  you should start busking  Place a sign in front of the sidewalk that says   I don t play any instruments or sing but I can give snide remarks to anyone   You ll get to meet lots of people and may even make some new friends and at the same time earn some passive income   have a new concept for your youtube channel where we see you giving snide remarks to random people   You may find happiness that way ,2,1
I don t like it when you don t have coffee ,1,1
Go rent an apartment house near your son in Japan  Request to see him every week  This is going to be a more satisfying life than just milling around US hotel rooms ,123,11
I think he needs to start dating again to get out of his funk  hasn t he been divorced 2 years  Usually judges issue a custody arrangement  she would be in contempt if she didn t allow him those days with his son  This guy seems very book smart but no common sense   He needs to find an attorney to guide him through this legally  just my 2 cents ,1,
Easier said than done    Especially requesting to see the son every week when the wife could request another restraining order,1,
Agree   Always push to see your kids as much as possible   Kids need their Dads ,8,
He can t have his family back but he can be more in his sons life  I  would do so that ,13,
This is the best advice  I agree 100 ,7,
 agreed  You r so smart  I am still waiting for you to realize that what you really want is your family back ,9,
Your narcissistic nihilistic personality is refreshing ,1,1
 I paid for a 9 5 experience  haha,14,1
U should get a real 9 5 jobs as a junior dev without them knowing u are overqualified ,271,16
 Puppetmaster2005 a lot of it is character and this persona he puts on  I do think he is a nice guy just dragged down by circumstances  so he comes out stronger  I think it s due to him wanting to deal with things  as opposed to actually being things he says superficially ,2,
You know    I used to really like Techlead  but the current version of him is so narcissistic that he probably won t be able to hold down a 9 5 job ,3,
 Shaiakh I beg to differ  he s literally put himself up on the Internet becoming this persona  he challenged Facebook hr for his YouTube videos    I don t think he fears anything  most likely it s his determination  my thinking is he may get a little hard headed on things and schemes that convince him  So all he needs  in my opinion  are the right people and ideas and  in my view  he will trail blaze again  I d like to emphasise again here  We re all human beings some understanding can go a long way ,4,
for example go to jail for scams,4,
 Illuminatus Deus he should do something related to prision industry,4,
Won t work  getting fired for policy non compliance is a big big deal  Career in an industry is pretty much over as a result  Plus Patrick s case involves youtube    some HR dude has his entire history at his fingertips   My recommendation is that he start something different  probably in another industry ,4,
Usually when I go to L A  I get paid to write code and do this   I typically get cheap housing thrown in and live near the beach   Early mornings  evenings weekends are my fundays   A sort of working vacation  every day  in say  Manhattan Beach or wherever   Someone always has an extra room to let ,2,
           not who but what and thats morality,7,
no need he prefers to make crypto scams instead of working,40,

Oh now you have Jokes   Good  I live in Palm Springs you should have hit me up  ,1,1
 And  how  long  do  you  think  we  can  keep  up  this  goddamn  coming  and  going    he   asked   The Techlead   had  kept  his  answer  ready  for  fifty three  years   seven  months   and   eleven days and nights    Forever   he said ,4,1
Next video  Why my parents left me ,3,1
 So with out that said I think I am having a pretty terrible time out here  I m not really sure what I am experiencing  There is no confirmation  there is no way for me to really know what I am experiencing out here  Is it good is it bad I don t even know   How do you know something if you are not sharing your experiences and life with others face to face  This is all about not having people in your life  It is human to share with others your experiences and that will give you positive feedback that will enhance your life  You are sharing with others on YouTube  which is good for us  but most of us have others to share our experiences with face to face  That is what is lacking here  Get out and meet people and share your life with others one on one  you have so much to share ,4,1
I mean  you could always move to south south central Ohio where you have a 30 45min commute to Columbus and live in an 11k sqft house on 55    acres for  1 2mil,1,2
well  I have been living alone few years with friends  since my age 16  so this is more comfortable for me  of course  I still love my mom and dad   I think It should be good for you to choose which you feel comfortable with you  it s your life          ,4,1
Guess the escapade didn t last long    ,1,1
I predicted this video  just didn t know when it would drop  ,2,0
You should stay in an expensive hotel as a millionaire,1,1
I m appreciating your roller coaster life as a millionaire  for entertainment value of course  As a non millionaire your channel increases my gratitude for my ordinary life ,65,1
 ,1,
Wait  Time stamps are screwy  I read he left home  Love the show but we need a blogger therapist to chime in  He s inadvertently justifying his wife  You need to stay out to retain your dignity ,1,1
Life is not about money but happiness   so spend your money on a nice place and buy it or life with your parents and help them give away your money and stop working    then you will find happiness,1,1
So you need someone to argue with   ,2,1
garbage content,1,1
maybe go visit the ports and see if you can help untangle the logistical bind  perhaps start a small transport business  get some trucks and drivers and start moving the containers off the ports for a premium     small business has less covid restrictions and less restrictions overall,1,1
You feel refreshed and amazing  keep this lifestyle and learn to streamline it  let s see how it goes  best wishes and good luck if u need a house let me know,3,1
Moving out   Getting your own apartment house  Not moving around hotels  ,5,3
I wish for you a nice lady friend at some point   ,1,1
Dude  to be honest it sounds like you just need some friends or a girlfriend  at least someone you can do stuff with  This makes moving out a lot easier since you have a social circle who got your back and so you don t get isolated when moving out ,13,5
Yeah  we joke around about him  but he seems lonely and kinda sad tbh  I think he has no one left but his parents ,7,
Well that escalated quickly,1,1
He s out coffee  so he has to move back in with his parents ,9,3
Maybe ask coffezilla ,2,
     ,1,
Why don t you buy a house and get a girlfriend  Money isn t happiness without a special someone to share it with  Also you are wasting your money paying for hotel rooms when you can put it into a mortgage   Get your like together it s all over the place,1,1
LMFAO this dude is hilarious,3,1
This YouTube channel is literally this guy s therapy  and it s amazing ,551,12
Whether he s lying or being sarcastic or saying the truth  it s actually pretty enlightening  him saying  there s no manifestation of emotions when we re alone  is something think about  it really does provide us to look at stuff from a different manner  It s cool  But don t trust him though  it might just be satire at the end of the day ,1,
if this type of content is your  therapy   you are in serious trouble LOL,1,
YT should delete his channel,6,
and Nobody s offering him a sleep over,2,
I kinda disagree with the two comments above mine  because I genuinely believe that this man is still struggling to accept the fact the he got fired and divorced that s why I believe it s also a sort of therapy to make these videos and of course it will generate his some money  but as a person who s going through a break up with my lifelong fianc e  I can relate to the turbulent personality that he s in right now or maybe I m just seeing it from my own perspective,24,
 Cry2Deep I kinda wish that s the case ,5,
You don t have any chance to check if what he says is even correct  I think he just shits out videos about anything he can imagine  Sometimes it s funny  but often times it s about the money he gets through the sponsorings,20,
it s kinda sad tbh,29,
In short  you moved out of your parent s house and now you are lonely  that s normal   Maybe  find someone new   Make sure they have good Internet too   If possible  leave California  go east  get off that crazy coast   Maybe head to Texas like Elon but don t forget to stop over in Vegas for a day or two of real fun and relaxation ,32,2
Good boy,1,1
why you get a 5G hotspot phone from Verizon for internet,1,1
He needs to get a job ASAP ,1,1
A thought for all those guys who decided to move out from their parents house following the TechLead  ,1,2
I doubt they would have moved out in a week,1,
You got to have coffee  I get that  Maybe try somewhere with safer streets next time  I don t think you can get  high quality  internet anywhere in this country though  You re The TechLead though  so  you would know   ,1,1
Next video why my parents kicked me out of their house as a millionaire ,1,1
Rather than marrying and living with nagging gold diggers  live with your parents or keep them along  Care for them  America needs to change for good ,2,1
I know you don t want to settle down  but  if you bought a house  you d at least have a headquarters to slink back to when going back to the drawing board ,2,1
Bro  you sound lonely  boarder line depressed  Find a new GF and make another kid  restart what you had  not all women are crazy,2,1
It would be interesting to hear your comments if you went to a different part of the country   You are still in California   Have you been to the SW   Work seems to be your number 1 priority   Don t give up on enjoying life ,1,1
Not sure if your a legit troll or a legit man child,1,1
A man that can change is mind is always right on every issue ,1,1
    lmao tl is the next comedy genius  Lol,2,1
Hey Mr  Techlead  can I go visit you,1,1
I swear TechLead is by far my favorite sit down comedian  Once I stopped being confused by him and started laughing with him my life suddenly became uniquely complete ,296,11
 J  The Millions of Dollars he made from scams he indorsed to his fans is pretty hilarious  Haha look im laughing so hard its funny,1,
 ItsQber i know  i meant adding  as a millionaire  in every single title is a joke,5,
Sit down comedian hahaha,5,
 ce he s actually a millionaire,2,
 Mon Ember i m pretty sure the  as a millionaire  part is a joke ,3,
Honest question  is he a comedian  Why does he title his videos as  as a millionaire   Is this just satire ,8,
He s hilarious ,6,
 ,1,1
Your journey is sooo interesting ,1,1
you need a real friend  someone u would enjoy common interest,1,2
Haha you know its bad when you drink the decaf   ,1,1
Sounds like you need a girlfriend dude    Or just someone to hang out with when you do go on trips to Palm Springs or wherever  I know that little vacay wouldn t be nearly as enjoyable by myself  Like you said  I d just be going thru the tasks ,3,1
You re missing fulfillment  I recommend finding some way to devote your life to helping others ,6,2
Have to agree   Grace also ,1,

God damn this guy is a master of something  Stay Based good sir ,31,2
  ,1,
Hey TechLead Go Visit a Beach near your stay  Make a Casual Vlog at Beach  from any of your favourite topics ,1,1
I think the problem is traveling  exploring  going out to eat is really not that great of an experience alone  It s like  fine  but not noteworthy  What feels way more meaningful is going and actually accomplishing some work  So for people like us  if the choice is between go out alone or do some work then we re going to want to pick work  You really need to find a partner to make going out really meaningful and enjoyable ,60,6
I remember traveling alone and realized that no matter where I went I was alone and that a friend would have made a great difference  It is hard to find friends to travel with though  Sometimes  you just have to make the best of it as a loner ,1,
I would add that the idea of travelling  exploring  experiencing in our modern society is overpriced  People who live where they are  they create relations  culture  local busines etc   they really live their life  Those who travel  they are like parasites  they just try to enjoy and do not make any contribution to real local life  I got to that idea closer to 40 yo  Later I found out that travelling is a new thing  people started to travel not so long ago  may be 100 years ago  A feudal lord  living in his own castle  or owner of a tavern   being offered to travel in order to relax and get new experience  could think that the adviser is kind of a freak ,4,
The restaurant food all begins to taste like Cisco,1,
Amen to this  Hit the nail on the head,4,
I want to see TechLead start a startup ,5,2
Why did you not rent an apartment   you re basically homeless   ,3,1
I mean it definitely sticks out that you re finding your current adventure meaningless without any companionship  Millionaires are still humans right  But then you also have the predicament of your previous companion really royally fucking you over  so it s probably difficult for you to trust your judgement of companions  In my unprofessional  non millionaire opinion  I d say it might behoove you to get to the bottom of what you missed when picking a partner and get closure about that  Then  when you ve internalized that understanding  try again and find a new partner  Hell  doesn t even have to be a woman  Could be another dude with similar circumstances that you can relate to ,1,1
Moved back in quicker than my pullout game ,29,1
I think you need to make some freinds while you out on your trips,2,1
Next title  Why I m Moving away from My Parents again  as a millionaire  ,6,1
Why are you so cheap  whats the point of being a multi millionaire  Just pay  300 500 a night and really enjoy your life for once  It will make no difference to your net worth ,1,1
You re a diva  bro  You need to cause a ruckus everywhere you go if you want some excitement  That s what I do when I go on an alcoholic bender  Go from hotel to hotel  causing chaos everywhere ,13,1
Living with your parents can be great experience  You can enjoy your time with them   Having parents that are health is a blessing ,16,1
Go to the Portola at the district they have good internet  Enjoy your stay here ,1,1
you re lonely    find people to connect with  live you life man  don t waste it going in pointless motions,2,1
You should collab with John Sonmez   He is in San Diego ,1,1
I m into health   fitness and like to be able to cook my own food  Hotel living can be difficult for someone who has specific dietary needs ,24,1
TechLead let s make a challenge rent a house on wheels  truck  and do the road trip through whole USA   this would be both educational and interesting ,1,1
Lmfaooo   This dude is hilarious  Wasn t his last video about moving out of his parents lol  ,14,3
I m sure this was planned in some way  maybe subconsciously  He s a funny guy  He knows comedy,3,
get a wife  man,2,1
His mom was getting tired of sleeping on hotel couches  Understandable  She wants to sleep in her bed  Techlead is going home people ,4,1
The problem is you don t have anyone to share your day activities with  You say you want to make yourself uncomfortable  Try and find a date or go speed dating  It will be very uncomfortable but you will grow as a person  and it may add more fulfillment to your life if you actually find someone compatible with you,2,1
Why video document a breakdown ,1,1
If I was you I d simply tour the entire Europe in a few years  taking my time while making the best out of it  eventually ending up in Switzerland I guess ,5,1
as you said in a previous video  happiness only real when shared,7,0
You have to give this experience 2 weeks  That s how long it takes to acclimatise to new circumstances psychologically  Don t decide before that time  It s too early ,1,1
Hey Tech lead  You should try Final Fantasy XIV,1,1
Where are your friends man  You are too rich to be alone  but are you smart enough to have company   and stay productive  ,1,1
let us know if you need some help burning those millions money  i am kinda bored right now  not as a millionaire ,1,1

Buy an apartment in Portugal and get the visa so you can get a permanent Schengen pass  Then set your budget at  300 day for hotels and live around Europe  Make sure it has a nice balcony you can work on and order room service  You have in excess of  9 million I m pretty sure  Put half of that in the NUSI  7  yield   315k per year  and go have fun   Edit  And what the hell are you doing wandering around Los Angeles staying in cheap hotels  Why  ,1,1
Funny  ,1,1
You should get a van motorhome and take your show on the road  With starlink you can get wifi anywhere  It would be interesting to hear your observations as you travel and promote your million token  Maybe paint or decal your tour bus or van with your  brand  and meet potential investors  Just a suggestion ,36,4
Let the man stay with his parents  What s the problem with u all   ,1,
Sadly Starlink prevents you from doing that  You have to chose a location  even though it could technically work like that ,5,

Patric  why u just dont buy an rv  Install a teltonika router with double sim and double modem like rut x12 or rut x14 and u are pretty much served  I did that and now im living in the Portugal by the ocean  Great weather  110mbps  cheap sail to rent  good food ,5,4
Very nice and really good solution   ,1,
You crack me up    get yourself home and away from that Covid hell hole    ,9,1

The title     you should do a cliffhanger series   keeping up with the tech lead   nice touch with the cheapest hotel you could find as a millionaire    ,20,2
Haha  I think this video should have been titled   I moved out and tried to live like a normal average American  doing a 9 5 job and living in a shitty house  without coffee  and life sucked  ,3,
that with the confirmation I can totally understand  Since my divorce nothing is really fun anymore  I also went out and traveled for a while  but it was just me and my thoughts    ,31,3
Travelling alone can be cool sometimes  having someone to share the journey with is even better  Time to get back on the horse brother  there s someone for everyone  Don t give up ,3,
I m so confused by this back and forth ,726,34
That is his modus operandi   confuse you then con you into buying his shitty coin   ,1,
 As a Zonday ,1,
He won t be held accountable for anything he says because he can always withdraw his previous statements by saying he was joking ,2,
He moved out and moved back in just so he can upload 2 click bait videos about why he moved away and why he moved back in   It s not really confusing if you have been following him ,5,
 MrRocksW is the book worth it  Id like to read it,1,

Gave Techlead Good Advice To Move Back In With His Parents   As A Pennyaire  ,28,2
haha,1,
Why does he live like this if he s a millionaire ,3,3
Because  success  is not all its cracked up to be,2,
You should come to Montreal  We ll show you around  bring you to a classical music concert   ,2,1
Techlead   I paid to have a nine to five job   that is classic  ,71,3
You got cool parents bro  A lot of people won t admit it but they ridicule this because their parents don t want their asses back LOL,127,11
 MsJavaWolf true  there are situations when it is necessary,1,
 ivo masi It can be shameful if you don t contribute  And if I ever have children I will push them to find their own place at some point  just so they become more independent  However  when there are real problems it s a completely different story  I will never understand how some parents can let their children become homeless for example  I would let my family live with me even if I lived in a shoebox ,3,
Extended families are becoming the norm   With them you control group assets and life can be more fun  with more options   For those who know how to share at least ,3,
Nothing wrong with ever doing that  as long as you can pull your weight alongside  But I feel like Techlead got to be straight about why he s moving back in  There are so many states out there that are cheap and have pretty good resources if you re just looking for a place to live  work and explore  Being in California and complaining about the cost when you re your own boss and are fairly wealthy is weird unless you re in a difficult situation and can t move elsewhere ,2,
I am 27 they will never take me back,5,
Its shamefull to be full grown man living under mama s skirt  ,6,
So true,4,
Only 5 positive high quality close friends are really needed  If your parents are one of the 5  even better ,4,1
Bro  TL   Man to Man   Learn how to take care of yourself   If you re out of coffee   Get off your arse  go to the store and get more ,2,2
This is so logical  He has money but thinks poverty ,1,
I just wachted the video saying he s moving out now he s already moving back wtf,3,1
I m glad I wasn t one of those conformist sheep who pressured you into moving out of your parents  house  There s arguably a difference between getting out of your comfort zone in California and trying to do the same in another part of the country or world  Moreover  if your desire to get out of your comfort zone doesn t have a clear  focused goal  then you ll just wander around aimlessly wasting both time and money ,67,5
 clutch not crutch  Simple misunderstanding  Clutch is a good thing,3,
 JM T It may be a clutch for you  the intellectually and financially deficient  but an opportunity to those who know how to capitalize on it ,3,
Hi Patrick  you ve must realize you can go anywhere  Go to Jamaica or Singapore  Up your game  Covid is problematic but everybody is going to have to deal with it  Travel far and fast  Look for remote worker communities that have brutally fast broadband and support services for remote workers  My mate is at one in Jamaica  Lucky sob ,16,3
He won t come to Singapore  It s really expensive ,1,
You need a girlfriend,1,1
Have you ever tried sex with an actual woman  Like one that breathes and has real skin  I recommend it  You will probably leave your parents house if its something that you like ,1,1

Thought the same ,1,
This is probably the most accurate and on point comment I ve seen in a while  ,2,
This guy is hilarious but he would be cancelled in a matter of minutes,4,

Lmao  no cap,1,
Get a booking for next btc conference,3,
Yes   ,2,
          ,1,
Why does he keep moving in and out,1,1
I always wonder why don t you try start writing motivational books  of course  as a millionaire  with your supernatural poetic  philosophical and sarcastic abilities garnished with adventurous life experiences  I m pretty sure they will easily be bestsellers like the likes of  The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fcuk ,22,4
 supernatural poetic  philosophical and sarcastic abilities     I have rarely ever seen such a boring  monotonous video ever lmao   poetic  hahahaha,2,
stop spending all your money on onlyfans and get a better hotel  i thought you re rich    why living like a peasant,1,1

I feel like being Asian is a blessed  You know that you ll always be able to count on your parents and relatives no matter what  ,157,28
I feel like this is true in most places in the world  just not the US  I am Polish and when my brother lost his job he moved in with our parents and it was no problem at all  We aren t even wealthy and they don t have a big house but it worked out somehow ,1,
Actually I had an argument with a filipino engineer whining about her brother staying at home with her parents   I said maybe it s a good thing and she let me have it   Too funny   Found out later that the filipino community is pretty split about this kind of thing    but seems most moms dads want their kids out to learn responsibility and about life ,1,
 Andov that love is called narcissistic love  I believe no one wants that  I envy westerners who know how to encourage their children chase for their own dream,3,
 summer y I see you had it tough    But you can t say that they don t love or care about you,1,
U don t know asian parents r demotivating to their children for whatever dreams  decision they made  no praise even u get good grades in ur exam  got straight A s with 2 subjects B they say it s not good  always criticising  n compare u with other people  I hv been in the shadow of their control I m happy to live alone now ,1,
 G Ga well  in France a lot of people still  get kicked out  of their house at 18  ,1,
Same for Italians  it is pretty much every where else except the USA  it is the culture   The US has cannibalized its own culture for about a hundred years now,6,
 Allan Bolton break the cycle  Form a family that can rely on you  the ripple effect will set you and your generations after you up,3,
I feel like being Black is a blessing   tf you talking about,1,
I just got my first job  but my parents always told me they ll always be here for me if anything ever happens  It s real comforting because I don t have to truly ever be on my own in dark times  Family is important ,7,
 Allan Bolton hey man  it s an opportunity for you to change things for the next generations  When you ll have kids show them that know matter what you ll be there for them and care  ,1,
 sma cool yeah I was born and raised in France and it is the same too  I guess it s almost in our genes  ,1,
