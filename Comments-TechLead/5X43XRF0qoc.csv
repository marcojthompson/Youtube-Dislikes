Hi Techlead  I ve been watching your video and some of your knowledge really change how my view of the crypto markets and even some of my own worls view  To be honest  I m living in Malaysia  which is a place where  sometimes  earning a 50usd per day would be hard for 70  of the population  Sincerely  my aim here learning defi  is just to merely earn a small passive income of usd50 per day or even usd30 would be really great  My question to you with full sincerity is  is it really possible to do it ,1,

In 2019  people have realized there isn t going to be one crypto to rule them all  You re seeing vertical solutions where XRP is focused on payment problems  Ethereum is focused on smart contracts  and increasingly  bitcoin is a store of value  Those aren t competitive  In fact  I want bitcoin and Ethereum to be successful,279,4

I came here to learn how to invest after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made  460 000 in 4 months from  160k  somehow this video has helped shed light on some things  but I m still confused  I m a newbie and I m open to ideas ,154,49

 Nurse Elena Exactly  the trick is to diversify your investment  don t panic when everyone else is and invest consistently ,1,
Most people are scared because of the chance of loss incurred while trading,1,
Great video really  Also i agree with your opinion  For the newbie if you are actually trading in the crypto space and you don t have a sound mentor  Then you are certainly going to get liquidated in 90  of your trades   Yeah that s the sad truth  For a start you need a good and experienced hand to guide you  Trust me  trading isn t difficult as we see it  With the right information and guide  you can earn hugely monthly,500,10

You are comparing TVL of 2020 with prices of 2021 and the months don t even match  That s confusing  I suggest comparing TVL with price without the examples  The DeFi passive income strategy instead makes totally sense  that s not risk free as you advertise but it s a valid opportunity ,1,2

Bitcoin price must hold the low  30k to continue its upward grind and finally conquer the psychological  10 000 level The price of Bitcoin  BTC  has been trying to break above the psychological barrier of  60 000  However  during the week  it failed to go through this resistance  This  fakeout  caused a significant portion of the market to shift from a bullish bias to a bearish bias  Is such a bias shift warranted in the current structure of the market  Altcoins have been continuing their upwards momentum since the drop with some demonstrating significant rallies  While BTC still fluctuates  In Times like this  when BTC s price is fluctuating  it takes time and understanding to go through without losing money  As for the newcomers who are yet to understand the upward and downward trend of BTC  they tend to lose a lot  cause when you trade without an accurate signal or a good strategy you are at a high risk of losing  I trade under the supervision of Mr HENRY   as an expert  broker from US  who has been handling my trades and also providing me with signals to trade  though its been six months since i met him i have managed to accumulate 12btc through his signals  traders who also want to increase their holdings  contact XBRITCLONE  ON  G,1,0

My concern with Bitcoin is  say I put money in Bitcoin and it goes to 100k  At this stage that would be like 3x my money since it s currently at 35k a coin    Compared to putting it in something like cardano which will also triple if it goes to 3   currently at 1     I feel like it is more likey for and faster for cardano to go from 1 to 3 then Bitcoin from 33 to 100  On top of that I also believe it will be more likey to multiply my money even more on lower costing coin   Am I looking at this wrong ,1,1

Hello   techlead  I would like to share my thoughts and get advice from you  I would like to learn ethical hacking  understand how operating systems work and maybe even write a little dumb one like how computer networks work  learn discrete mathematics  design patterns  testing  theory of computation  mathematical statistics  master Knuth s books  What is worth spending time on   1     It seems to me that everything I have listed  except for hacking  is the basics that everyone should know  no matter if they want to become a mobile developer  web  desktop  etc  Generally speaking  I don t know what I m going to do  I don t know if I want to make websites or do artificial intelligence  and it seems logical to know the base in advance so that you can study anything  Is this correct or not  2   And  all the time I have such an idea in my head that knowledge should only be obtained for a long time and in a strict order  such as  now we are learning theory  calculations and  only after two books on this topic are understood  we proceed to study  for example  patterns designing and after 3 courses and 6 books on patterns  we start doing some kind of project  from here thoughts will appear on how to design so that the application is productive  safe  etc  and this is another 100 books     I think correctly  3   In short  I only know the basics of programming so far and don t know where to go and what I would like to do  Could you answer these questions Or give some advices  here in the comments  Or if there is a video with answers to these questions  share the link    Sorry that the topic of my question does not match the topic of the video ,2,2
The pegged dollar LP pools with high APY is risky   These defi exchanges are leveraging these pools  and eventually will rug via  flash loan  exploits  Be careful when doing LP and random defi exchanges ,1,0
At this point  we should all take advantage of the dip Nobody can predict crypto  dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what s actually happening to the cryptos in which you ve invested  My advice to new investors  More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  Trading went smoothly for me as I was able to raise over 15 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from  Chris Parkinson  this is one of the best mediums to back up your assets in case it goes bearish  You can reach Chris on Telegram  expertchris  ,2,0

Hey TL  thanks for the video  On a previous one you recomended to buy and hold stuff  not trying to predict the future vale of assets  great video by the way   You said that one should keep something like 2 to 5  of equity invested in crypto  Now it seems that you are trying to predict wich cryptos will increase value  so I m confused  How do you mix those 2 things  It is ok to try to predict value   as long as you do that with a very small percentage of your money  Thanks for all the great content you put out ,3,1
Yes  diversify  Some percentage in stable coins  as a hedge   some in top tokens  some in defi  etc  The riskier the asset is  the less you should have in it  depending on your personal comfort levels   The biggest returns come from the riskiest investments  but so do the biggest potential losses ,3,
Tech lead there is a mistake in your assumption   TVL is composed of all the values of the tokens of a cha ne    So when the market crashes or go up the prices of the tokens of the specific chain fluctuates and So do the TVL  It dosen t necessary mean NEW money is  comming or leaving the chain  Therefore your analysis can be correct only and only if we assume that the price of the tokens composing the chains like  matic eth   is stagnant which is never the case   hop you guys gives this comment a thumbs up so tech lead can answer maybe i m mistaken,35,2
 TechLead Hey I ve sent you a long email   check it up,2,
In the charts  you can price TVL based on native currency to exclude market volatility   This is what I did in the overlays analysis ,15,
The Market has been pretty bad until today it decided to surge  Everybody was  Practically Crying then  It kept  dipping  That s what you get when you feel you can navigate the process on your own  Big thank to Raphael Castillo  I m not bothered with how bad the Market is because my assests are insured due to her advice and I still receive my profits,11,12
Really good video  thank you ,1,0
Please who can recommend me to a professional trader  ,5,10
For liquidity pairs loss  aren t there losses when the value of the coin goes up  Is it worth it ,3,5
Look up impermanent loss  You don t lose money you just don t make as much  If the coin goes up 2x you lose about 5  of the gain  The benefit is holding them over a long period of time  getting paid in LP tokens  and trading fees that stack up to increase your holdings ,2,
Good question   ,2,
Glad i found this  i can finally get out of dumpster and make some real money ,2,1
The crypt0 market is facing a key moment right now  in a very short time it s gonna see a break0ut to new rec0rd highs  This is a critical moment that every lnvestor needs to be aware of to buy more  While the recent plunge has put the crypt0 community into a state of panic  one HODLer is taking advantage  The third largest Bitcoin whale just bought the dip  putting his stack over 121 000 BTC   With the current market trends  lnvesting in bitcoin now would be a very smart move to make as it s gonna skyr0ck soon   ,13,10
