As you can see we are already in April and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 2 BTC when I started at 3 5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Ryan Donald s would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren t sure about ,111,15

I ve got some confidence in BTC by watching an interview with Armstrong His model is not based on the few examples of 4 year cycles  but rather on the rate at which new wallet addresses appear on the blockchain and the nature  size and the behavior of wallets of similar size  of the wallets   So he models the adoption curve   He reckons adoption is still in full swing  and his  moving target  is currently a price of  120K for BTCat end of 2021   He also mentioned that the  1 trillion market cap is a barrier   that there would be a lot of resistance to falling below  55K   So I was convinced to start buying BTC again  not much to hodl but trad  If only my people listened when i first told them about Tribesmen  My actual portfolio was multiplied  In two months  After getting in touch with Armstrong Peters of the Crypto Tribesmen a well known name  in the cryptospace  who showed me how to use it s programs to make transactions and got I7 btc in 2 moths with it  He can be reached only on Telegram   Goldsfolio,97,0

  Spot on with your analysis mate  One thing I ve learnt from whales is that they hunts for empty liquidity pockets  So far it s been a long sideways movement for days which has left the price slowly bleading till it gets the liquidity for upward thrust  in case you wondered  we are looking at a 5 fold range bound fractal  This must be the rangiest range I ve seen in years for Bitcoin  The vast majority of discretionary traders tend to become more and more hopeless as the range box develops  It s a patience test failed by many  This is a pivotal moment and that s why the majority will regret  If it goes down  people say  why haven t I sold If it goes u  people say  why haven t I bought   In September 2021 bulls trapped the bears  check the lower wick on 21th of September and now a buy signal has been given which strongly indicates a final bottoming process is locked  One of the scenario s from career trader Callum Lucas is that bulls will use the same trick  as his automated sig    nals based on unique combinations of trend  momentum and volume scanners supports this thesis  So far I ve accumulated over 8BTC trading with it  If interested then reach out through Te  E G  m  callumlucas,72,2

While bitcoin s wild  price movements might seem random  they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets  Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance  it s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin   Keeping all this in mind  it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world  Jennifer Signals has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 19 BTC lately  You can reach Jennifer on  eI    m Jenniferwilbur,54,7

The funny part is that doing almost anything with crypto  even trying to put yourself in a position to do what you re advising  will see much of it vanish away on gas fees  I tried playing around with  400 to set up such a liquidity pair and I was down to  251 in just a few quick easy steps  with 37  of my initial  investment  going poof on gas fees  If this is the future of our financial system  please make it to away ,2,5
Provide liqudity to a stable coin  and focus on proof of stake chains  low gas fees,1,
 Stay calm  thought we all got used to the ups and down of bitcoin  it hit ATH recently which made the price amazing for every early investors and will be back soon  it s just bouncing back to normal price for the rest of us which is good while for those who got in for the first time its otherwise  who hold the longest will profit the most  I trade and hold profits  keep up the great work   William  and also William Henry Morgan has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 11btc lately    ,97,6

Just a thought here  As I gather from all the post in this and other channels  why not just to to your local bank and borrow  10k  50k  100k and buy Bitcoin  With such fantastic returns  there should be more than enough to pay for the interest and have the remainder continue to grow ,2,4
Don t stop there  Put up your organs as collateral for a bigger loan  ,2,

There are always abuse cases  Some of the billionaires from electronic cash are arms dealers and drug dealers  So called financial democracy started in the 1920s  We are also witnessing the democratization of academic knowledge among others  A relevant progression would be that everybody could claim to be the inventor of fill in the blank  Proprietary rights are currently out of hand  Financial engineering includes using clean and safe tools ,1,0
