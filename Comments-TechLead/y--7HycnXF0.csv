OK here is an argument for you  how is a central Bank Digital Currency different from the mobile banking that you do on a day to day basis  The answer is there is no difference  Governmnet would just sell you the same thing in a new package  The maximum of what can be achieved with central banking currencies already exists ,1,

You re so intelligent  calculating  and manipulative  It s really hot  So attractive and sexy   and I m a guy lol  There s no reason why this link wouldn t be a method of you reclaiming some money back  I kind of want to trust you  though  You were completely up front about your data analysis  and  I ve seen enough of your videos to reasonably conclude that you are upfront with your schemes and patterns of thought and have some sort of conscience beneath your stern  detached exterior and witty dry humor  But you ve been through a lot so you ve definitely been shaped by adversity  Despite being so introspective and focused on self actualization and personal success  your morals may be long gone  You said that winning is all that matters and that emotions are unnecessary  Don t underestimate him  guys  Don t be na ve  Maybe I m giving him too much credit  but I love it when seemingly silent  docile wolves in sheep s clothing bare their fangs without even trying       ,4,

People need to understand  we are ALL EARLY IN CRYPTO   exchanges are relatively small compared to mature global stock  futures  currency   commodity exchanges  this means prices are much more easily manipulated by a few big whales   volatility will be the norm    anyone trying to day trade crypto  swing trade crypto or  time  bull or bear markets is playing with fire  The right way to invest within a relatively new sector with young exchanges  is to invest in longterm advanced projects like HBAR  ADA  VET  XRP etc     that we all know will be the first coins to gain widespread utility use in blockchain systems     buy  and hd through bear or bull markets and check back in 3 years     your coins will vastly outperform any other type of investment you put money into in those 3 years     ,1,0

You re pretending to not let your emotions influence your decisions but get scared by the usual noise in the markets and then exit  Makes no sense to me  I am in crypto since 2013 and let me tell you  this is not a sprint it s a marathon  If you are losing your position because of short term TA chart patterns  the FED or  insert FUD of your choice here  you are doing it wrong  On the other hand you are promoting a stock trading app which you for sure get a nice kickback  This is as fishy as it can get   ,1,1

Why do you expect the central bank s digital currency is going to change anything  We already have digital money platforms right now such as Zelle  Quickpay  Venmo  Paypal  Google Pay  Amazon Pay  Facebook Pay  Stable coins  and Bank electronic transfers  Those platforms are much better than the central bank s digital currency in many ways  You have to understand the central bank s digital currency and digital money platforms are the same things so they complete with each other  But  the central bank s digital currency and Cryptocurrency is a different target group  Please  don t confuse with blockchain technology ,1,0

Crypto market is becoming more appealing to investors seeking low correlation assets that diversify portfolios  I d say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life  even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position  The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen  I got this tips first hand from Javi Cl udia   He s always a step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings has increased drastically from 10 1 Bitcoin to 48 7 Bitcoin in just 2 months and some days  I ve full confidence in his trading abilities  You can easily get to him on             javicla   and w h a t s a p p          4     6     7     0     1     9     2     1     5     5     9  ,32,8

Great content     I mean honestly  if your only goal  to become a millionaire  is to just beg to make a foolish decision and be disappointed     I think many will become millionaires in this current bull market  but it is not the right mindset as Hodlin can be very dangerous  As difficult as it is to trade  Ng Crypto is much more lucrative and it is quite logical if you only study the charts and the resistance of the support and pay attention to what is happening  I am not a professional trader  but I was lucky to earn 10 BTC since the end of last year after the instruction signals from Rick Richard  He runs a program for investors newbies who don t understand how Bitcoin trading works  to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also accumulate more bitcoins  You can easily reach Richard on Telegram  rickrichardcrypto for Crypto related information ,3,4

And what does this tell you   It s time to BUY   I d like to see it go down to  20 and then I d buy a shitload   From a TA standpoint  look at the complete MA  not a 30 day  100 day  200 day  etc  to view the overall trajectory   In terms of the power issue  the majority of the major mining operations utilize 85 90  of renewable energy   Please research and don t assume blindly information which is pushed to you ,1,1

Do you really need to write   As a millionaire   to get some views   ,1,0
Extremely point by point video   Well I will also say this here   Most people don t understand the concept OF  buying the dip   buying the Dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling  off  when the price rises just as the current market is down  Holding is great  Although trading is far more profitable  I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough  but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyse the digital market  All that changed when I encountered Gray Ken Services  I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Gray Ken that has made me over 16     This is his details on             Grayken2   for his assistance on strictly crypto related plans ,91,6
Yes incontrovertible and unequivocal  remarks is all I have read and heard about this  Gray Waeber for a while now  Would try this out with my 3 2 BTC,1,
Fact it  Most people think buying the dip and hodling is the only way to achieve success in crypto  But guess what wrong   I got rid of that mentality after I engaged in tradlng daily and earning around  40k weekly with Gray Waeber methods   ,1,
You tubers don t actually care if you lose money  they just want more views and traffic  This is why I respect Mr Gray  he actually takes his time to coach you step by step on how to trade with his strategy  I recommend him ,1,

You can keep saying that until you re blue in the face  they wont listen  They ll sell in a panic and lose money  unnecessarily when logic is saying they should just hold until it recovers  and even buy more if they have some more money they can afford to spend right now,4,

I have always been suspicious of how correlated the movement of the coins are   you mentioned that all coins move together because of the  hysteria    but could it be that who ever is behind Tether Ltd  is moving the markets  That there is a program that is automating the selling which is why it all moves together ,1,1

Here s the thing  You re late in bringing up the rising wedge from some weeks ago  nor did you sell when it was forming back then   While you focus on past TA  you re ignoring the current TA which is currently a falling wedge  ready to break 53k   There are reasons why most people don t get rich off of investing  even in the cryptocurrency space  The problem is  you aren t buying when the rich people do  you re buying  after the big green candle  which formed after fear   This has been going on for years  same old tricks  crash BTC shakeout the weak hands  and everytime we see some hotshot youtubers fall down then get left behind by the greatest investments in the world ,4,1

 I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated crypt0currency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  She believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Ryan Morris he is always one step ahead of other tradrs  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 6 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his stratqy  You can easily get hold of his for a pr0fitable system on TE LE GRAM   Ryanmorris735   ,129,12

Yikes I say this with love man  But you have some strange standards  Your ex wife might of been annoyed on how over analytical you are  Investment takes risk and patience  there is no such thing as perfect investment portfolio  Crypto is most definitely the future  If you think we re going to be using the same system by the year 2050 then your way out of your senses  Look back at history see the symptoms  Connect the dots  There s a lot more going on behind the  curtains and we re just at the beginning peak of it all  Remember 200 million people in crypto and we have 7 billion in population  It cannot be compared to buying gold stocks  That s based on a broken system ,5,0

I have been watching YouTube for many years now and I have to say this guy is the best at misleading headers and titles ,21,2
 Michal Gazdik according to him  he is a supposedly super smart genius who supposedly worked at Google and is a stinking millionaire and never forgets to mention the millionaire part  Who now makes YouTube videos to help people by virtue signalling how smart he is and always in a subtle and indirect way calling people dumb   I assume you re a smart person  you should be able to tell when someone is using these click bait headlines  Don t get me wrong I don t have any problem with the guy  I like his boring nature  is different  But I can t help but see the deception and manipulation been done with the titles   Maybe I am wrong but he comes across like a broke guy looking for YouTube views  I am probably sure he is a millionaire  but that s how he comes across  I know people  I trust my instinct on this guy  Good luck to him though   Thanks for the reply  Michal ,1,
why misleading  He is done with all this crap  He sold everything in the last video and now he explained what happened in the market and is very likely not buying this anymore  Makes sense ,7,
There is no future for crypto in its current form    China banned it  Nobody takes it  It lacks stability  and anybody can create their own crypto currency  Transaction fees are high  Assets don t go up thousands of percent without falling dramatically just as quickly   Let s say we retrace to a level just a few months ago  So doge was at 1 to 5 cents  I suspect it will return to those levels  Get out while people still are delusional   The diamond hands peer pressure to stay in a plummeting asset  which has no value other than hoping a greater fool will buy it  has no place in trading   Sell your crypto before you lose the majority of your crypto wealth,1,0

Agreed 100   The central banks need to control their own currencies in order to have an influence over the economy   help stabilize it  We learned this in the Great Depression  They will not allow a currency to replace or even threaten one of their own for this reason  Similar reason why the Euro ended up being such a bad idea  Governments like Greece had no way to control their economy through fiscal means and their economy crashed  For sure  this isn t the only reason Greece nearly collapsed  But it played a part  I can also point out Spain and a few others   The fed needs the economy to neither get too hot nor too cold   I see BTC as more of a trading idea  not an investment  for this reason  Regulations will continue to ramp up ,1,1
Sorry to say but you re kind of old and out of touch   that s my take away from your fear of crypto  Yes I m out of the market at the moment  but you are coming off as old and out of touch  I enjoy your logical viewpoints and admittedly some of your narcissistic observations  but you are losing IQ points with your misunderstanding of crypto and it s potential ,1,2

 Omkar Jadhav thats B S you think government will stop bitcoin or crypto    they wont because most politicians have a crypto portfolio  and also a lot of supperannuation firms have crypto options of which government get taxes on   and crypto as well government get capitol gains taxes   its too lucrative for them to stop it,1,

Bitcoin scalability issues can be fixed with a protocol like Lightning  With Lightning you can have close to zero fee per transaction and trades themselves are instant  And as a bonus it makes it harder for 3rd parties to track your money  because Lightning Network can act as a mixer  mixing your coins with coins of other people  and it compacts many transactions into a single one  And compacting many transactions into a single one makes it impossible to verify how many taxable events have happened   that information is not recorded in the blockchain  In order to get that information enemy would need to spy directly on your activity in Lightning Network  And spying on every user all the time is a much harder task than just analyzing the blockchain ,1,0

 Naijarianman on second thought  I think you might be right  A lot of what he s said about Bitcoin makes no sense  It just lacks logic  I thought it was strange for a while  Especially the way he just incessantly trashes Bitcoin  Does not sound like the logical and emotionless Tech lead I know   He seems to be trying to bring down Bitcoin price as much as he can,1,
Thank you  you think like me  Honestly Techlead sounds like Bill Ackmann during the stock market crash in March 2020  He was shorting while going on CNBC telling everyone to sell and we re all doomed ,1,

I was telling someone a week ago that a total crypto bad was just like two colonial pipeline incidents away  Bitcoin is so risky and however we like to kid ourselves  regulation is needed  We may not like it  doesn t mean we won t take up arms if the government actually let s every one do whatever they want ,1,1

It depends  If it runs to zero   you sure better off selling  At the end of the day though  Crypto has no real world value  it is simply a demand driven Ponzi scheme   You will always need more fools to come in and buy it  once it gets too expensive for the new fool to enter  you then have to crash it  At first  crypto was supposed to be a means for exchange  that hasn t work due to it is high energy use and ridiculous transfer fees   now they said it is an asset like Gold  It won t be an asset like gold because of its volatility    but I have to admit there will always be new fools and therefore it will remain a   hustler s game  ,1,

I think of Bitcoin as the   gold   of the virtual world  The concept  developed by Satoshi Nakamoto  who may be a person  or group  we don t know  however the concept of having a decentralized currency caught on  at first  currency to use on the black market   remember Silk Road on the dark web    It may never become a currency recognized by countries around the world  but  think about this  gold has value  but  is not used to trade in commerce  But  it has value  Bitcoin is the gold of the virtual world ,1,1

Anyone willing to buy Doge has zero understanding of this market  Zero   BTC crashed 67  a year ago  I m guessing you haven t paid any attention to historical patterns of 2013  2017 and how the S2F model plays a major role in price appreciation  There were many calling a retracement to 30K 40K range  This isn t new for those who have been here  This market will shake out weak hands   TechLead  that s you     I ll check back in a few weeks when the bull market continuation   yes still a bull market   will have the emotional support of those who sold  Over leveraged longs was the problem here  If you look at Blockchain analytics  a tremendous amount of BTC was moving from small wallets to big wallets  In other words   whales are accumulating here  The weak  newbie investors were shaken out  This happens time and time again  Nothing new this last week ,2,1

   crypto is simply nothing you should use as a currency and will use  Its a chance to invest into a technology that allows decentralized solutions  Coins with the market fit of a currency will not survive and no goverment will ever allow them on a long run      but thats okay   crypto is a chance to invest into a technology  instead of a company  In the future all companys will have crypto currencys   they will use it as utility tokens for their incentive systems   and as a feature you will be able to trade them  like sports clubs nowadays allow sport club tokens     crypto will survive and the technical solutions that will allow stable coins from countrys will get a geintroduce the bull  A lot of real world solutions will be build on already existing coins   like fundamental issues in the health system can rely on projects like vechain for drug validation   the nature of being able to use it as a currency  will be nothing people want to do in the future  Why should you trade a good investment against consumer goods if you can trade a country inflationary cryptocoin against it     yes you wont trade away potential growing investments   you will at max trade them against other investment classes that allow a slow exchange  rent property vs bitcoin     etc    going out of the market is a big fail   and since 2012 its always the same       holding is fine   dont get scared by people who are in the space since 2 years  getting broke all over and panic selling and trying to market time  Its a new asset class and it will envolve into a technology investment class   instead of buying google stocks  you can buy the android OS as a tech solution    Market cap is small   so it will explode   and when country coins start   fast adjusting defi projects will make their way to heaven    ,1,0

Hey TechLead   you ve made emotional move and now trying to justify your decision playing cool  Bitcoin here is not to replace currency   it s to replace gold   if you would made a research   you would know  I ve saw such kind of drops in 2014 and 2018 and I just hold  There is no reason to believe that something else will happen this time ,1,6
 Bruce Mate From my perspective Bitcoin  not any crypto in general   Bitcoin itself  should be treated as deflationary tool  something protected from inflation  in investment portfolio  The tool which is mathematically proven to be hard to spoof or influenced by any government or group of people  It s not meant to be a sort of currency and the speed or convenience of transaction is not a major priority  Out of this definition we can derive that price of Bitcoin will only raise over time  As for stability   the price defined by the hashrate and investors  The amount of energy spent on mining  hashrate  protect Bitcoin from spoofing and make Bitcoin more secure  Basically   amount of energy spent on mining is the price we pay for security  And adoption mainly drive the rest of the price  From this video you can see how adoption part works   when people think that it is a competitor to currency   dollar   money in general and drop it on panic thinking that some other crypto can compete  Can Bitcoin drop to zero  Yes it can  Will it  I personally hardly doubt  The main chart you need to check is this   Bitcoin Hashrate Chart    as long as it go up or stay on the same level   everything will be ok with Bitcoin  When it will start to drop it s probably would be a good the time to sell  Not a financial advice though ,1,
 DimonEx and the value of gold being in part due to the durability of the material  if bitcoin  is able to be durable as well even with the rise of evolved versions  lower fees and more scalability   crypto currencies in the future,1,
 DimonEx thanks for your answer and sorry for the confusion  my question was more like  is the value of bitcoin coming from it being accepted  as a mainstream decentralized and secured transaction method  which was the primary goal  or if it was it becoming a mainstream kind of stable investment like gold  and how it wouldn t have its popularity stolen by other kind of crypto currencies that could fill the primary goal at a larger scale   Or are we talking more about crypto currencies in general when we say bitcoin   And I can confirm I didn t invest in the stock market  so you can take it into consideration ,1,
 Bruce Mate Visa process gold transactions or money transactions  Have you ever tried to buy something on the stocks market  To settle down the transaction you need to wait couple days  there is a minimum amount of payment below which you can t buy  price of stock   some funds require minimum 3k of initial investment and all this works somehow for everybody ,1,

I think that your point is very good  and i dont think that crypto are the future of money  not all of them at least  We are in a very new market and internet saw the same during his first decade of mass adoption  But project like btc or eth are great and have the right to exist in my opinion  So in the long run i think that btc is great and is the only thing we have that is really democratic  So i think that now is a great time to buy if you believe in the project  and i think im gonna sell my btc when ill buy a house  i didnt bought btc to get rich  i bought it for the idea of freedom it delivers  I hope you can make a video about btc in general not about bear o bull markets  Tanks  TechLead,1,0
 Would a country use a decentralized digital currency     yes  reserve currency  The US just devalued it s debt by 25  you think other countries are just going to be happy about that ,1,1
crypto pro tip     XRP thrives in an environment of CBDCs  its what it was purposely built for ,8,1
TechLead  you re right   The whole crypto thing is dumb and overhyped   Ethereum is too slow and unworkable   Cardano has potential  but when governments are effectively banning crypto and regulating it  I m out   Back to stocks like Tesla and Palantir ,1,0

 Zeno s Grasshopper I d like you to explain how you are getting 78  ROI please ,1,
 Zeno s Grasshopper I made 75  last year as well  but only because I bought everything in the bottom of the Market  Thank God for the Pump ,2,
Maybe Mr  Ramsey can explain how my 78  ROI can be duplicated in the stock or any other market  EDIT  Yes  that s in the current market ,2,
Good ol Dave hes old school in his index fund,1,
This is long haul thing and a bet against central banks ,2,
I think you re wrong in a bigger sense  I agree with pretty much everything you said but I also think know that they ll keep using market manipulation to take advantage of people here ,3,3
 Armani Webb Ya true    but the market manipulation is them putting the fear into the people ,1,
There is no market manipulation  Simply human psychology  All price is is a buyer and a seller  Look at the sentiment all over media and social media    fear  This is what is causing prices down  Along with over leveraging of the market,1,
making back your crypto losses by pumping out FUD crypto videos potentially increasing the losses of other bag holders is extremely meta imagine if everyone who lost money in crypto made their money back by making videos about why you shouldn t buy into crypto and then using the money you made from the videos to buy more crypto this is literally free money and makes more sense then the current monetary system,10,2

All the lemmings that flew off the cliff in excitement for gains will run away just as quick from the fear of losing it all,1,1
TechLead is actually speaking a lot of sense  Cryptocurrencies are still very new and Jim from the local town thinks he s a prophet when really he s betting his life savings based on a tweet from Elon Musk    the space is full of virtue signalling and shitty memeing that makes for dangerous financial decisions ,3,2

Let me tell u in simple term  Oil is going to continue to go higher and higher and higher from here      You are going to thank me later,1,
I saved myself this crash  I sold and bought back in for more at a lower price  and because of this saved my portfolio and am seeing good gains even amongst bitcoins turmoil  I will never invest in bitcoin  because it s ancient technology  there are so many better outperforming cryptos in the market ,7,0
Nah you guys don t know how trading works   Just stick to tech my friend   Up and Down is normal in any asset it s being like that for the decades  Buyers can t make money without sellers and sellers can t make money without buyers ,1,4
exactly  even if I don t buy back in  until the 2022 2023 re accumulation periods  I m 400  ahead and had a good run ,1,
technical analysis doesnt work  nobody can use it to see the future  whats the price going to be exactly monday ,2,1
After a 50   drop  the market could easily reverse and you will be having sold the bottom     especially in your case  when you have other million dollars in the bank  there is no point in selling crypto now  absolutely no point   ,10,8

Crypto is C I A operation  Psyop   CRYpto  ,2,1
if BTC hits 20k im going all in lol,13,7
I think I will buy more too and  BCH  the high was over 4k   now on sale for around  500   Why would anyone want a digital dollar    When they are printing actual dollars in the trillions making it worthless  Only 21 million of bitcoin can ever be made there is a cap  the dollar has no cap  Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation  Tech lead is totally missing the point because he is too pessimistic  like Charlie Brown  I don t think he is going to be a millionaire for long because he is too negative glass half empty mindset  If you look at the graphs of all years  from the start of bitcoin this is what bitcoin does before it goes back up ,2,
It could bottom out between 9 000   12 000 if we follow the peak to bottom cycle Bitcoin did during the 2017 post halving bull run  It went from 20 000 to a little over 3 000 in that spread ,2,
Good videos  plenty of experienced insights   I d be curious what you think about these two very unique projects  the Internet Computer Protocol  IPC   and Hedera Hashgraph  HBAR    These are in the crypto world  but they re really technology foundations ,2,0
I stopped watching when you mentioned you bought dogecoin ,1,2
he does that bc a few thousand means nothing to him,1,
Not everything crypto is related to currency   There are quite a few legit projects that have great tokens  Chiliz for example is a solid project  huge partnerships   some of the biggest soccer teams in the world f1 teams  ufc    Absolutely 0 chance of a rug pull ,3,0
for me this is a fantastic opportunity to buy the supports and sell at a 45  recovery from top,49,7
 MrSlm1982 it might get there but it ll be bear market for the coming weeks and possibly months  There s no way to know for how long  where it ll stop  Once it settles  it will possibly drop again ,1,

It s clear who missed the crash in 2017 by these overblown reactions to a significant dip in crypto price  If you think this is the end of crypto or that crypto won t continue to become increasingly valuable  you re simply delusional ,56,9
When you have people with no finance experience  or knowledge of markets flooding the market  and you have businesses fraudulently creating currency out of thin air with no real assets to back them  its probably time to get out and let the suckers lose their homes ,2,
 God Effective How do you know huge institutions are buying ,1,
 James Anderson Lol your delusional  Or your just  new to crypto ,1,
 James Anderson lmao okay,1,
people complain when flash sales are on   ,3,1
This guy obviously just regrets losing 300k and is trying to make it dip so he can buyback ,3,1
I ve never believed into Bitcoin ,5,4
And that s why you work a 9 5  and those who did are millionaires ,2,
I haven t either  but that s mostly because I know how many governments hate the idea of anonymity and eventually will push to ban cryptocurrencies  just like China did to Bitcoin ,1,

 Manuel Goku dester people were saying that when it dropped from 60k to 50K   Then again at 40K   And again 35K   When it hits 25K I m sure more will say the same        ,1,
 I Bramblebush I m buying at 15k  and Bitcoin ain t going anywhere  just doing it s regular 80  drop every  other year  And everytime it drops  it feels like it s the end but when it goes back up it s gonna be over 100k before dropping to 20k again ,7,
