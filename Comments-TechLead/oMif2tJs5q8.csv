Is this not kidnapping and parental alienation ,2,
think someone pretending to be you on comments phishing possibly similar name asking for personal info,1,
Prenups get thrown out of court regularly like its nothing  you really shouldn t be advising men to take on such flimsy precaution that likely won t even hold up in court  You re giving them a false sense of security when the legal system is prejudiced against them   Seriously think about it  if you are being charged with abuse  its very easy for her lawyer to argue the prenup was signed under duress  lawyers have successfully argued this  without  and abuse charge  so imagine how effective it would be in a case like yours   You could have your wife sign a prenup with the signing being filmed on camera and both of you visibly having separate legal representation to legitimize the process and  EVEN THEN  it could be thrown out in court lol   Prenups are completely useless these days    The only way to win at a rigged game is to simply not play   There s no reason for a man to get married these days  especially for a man as a millionaire  who has much more to lose   What you should be advising your male audience to do is to look at the data  Look at the statistics for divorce rates today Look at the statistics for the top reasons for divorce   1 is unsurprisingly finances  Look into the reality of what  no fault  divorce is Etc  They ll easily deduce that there s no point in getting married  and if they still choose to do so then whatever happens happens  it was their choice   I know you said humans are irrational and they rationalize actions after the fact but that just sounds like a convenient excuse to me that someone can use to allow themselves to do something because they  feel like it  whenever its convenient to them  despite all logic and reasoning telling them that its not worth   It just sounds like you trying to cling to the idea of  love ,1,

Hey  TechLead  concerning MILLIONTOKEN  can you create a smart contract for a BEP 20 version of the token       There is a massive crypto market that only buys trades yield farms stakes on the Binance Smart Chain or Polygon networks  due to the gas fees on the Ethereum network   It would be fantastic to capture this market for the MILLIONTOKEN  listing it on PancakeSwap   BakerySwap ,1,

 Get a prenup   Good advice  If the person is just interested in beeing with you and respects you  she will sign a prenup  Shouldn t be an issue  You can plan for a fair separation ahead just in case  It might be even very helpful for both sides in case of a divorce not beeing carried away by emotions  Separate the stuff  separate the lives  work out good arrangements  Why does this have to be a problem at all ,5,

What do you think the odds are this is what got you fired at Facebook  I bet she called your work too if she was willing to do all that other stuff,3,
This really is a common way for women to abuse men  but  of course  the hypersensitivity of this topic allows this to continue to happen while innocent men are sent to jail with no one daring to talk about this  except the police officers  lawyers  and judges  many of whom don t actually want to address this abuse of the court system because it benefits from the rotation of men in custody ,5,
Family Court is a Kangaroo Court designed to break down the family unit  by extorting money from the family via Legal Fees  and asset forfeiture  legally created and assigned arrears via child support  alimony ext     Family Court is a Marxist Dream come true  the  abolishing of family   which destroys the basic building block of society  ie the family  which is a basic  Divide and Conquer  strategy   All families living under the legal system are vulnerable to the court system  it just takes one disgruntled family member  to burn down the Family unit ,10,
You should put this as it is  A way to invest in you as a youtuber and support you  Think this is a much more modest approach and would start a good trend amongst content creators ,3,
  damn that sucks I know how it feels for someone you love so much to just back stab you  Atleast your ex wife didn t want your literal head  Sh t my ex wanted mines and to hold me for ransom overseas  We had to get an authority whom was trust worthy enough to help me    crazy     I see and treat the guy as an uncle cuz i never had that kind of kinship and help before in my life  Guy just passed away recently  His sense of justice and ethics is like no other I seen before  He even sacrificed his own mother s necklace to help me buy the tickets needed to come back to the US  I LOVE THIS GUY  I will never forget him and the lessons he taught me  RIP   Treat everyone with respect no matter their walk in life  Everyone has their own stories    Tips for anyone whom goes overseas  have backups incase   If you don t love someone   Just leave  All the commotion and violence is definately not needed  I m happy you re ok Tech Lead ,5,

Sorry you had to go thru that police experience   many ppl are falsely accused   innocent till proven guilty   I have and like   shiba inu    ,17,
Dude    I feel for you  But you did everything wrong  You cannot advertise that you re wealthy around potential partners  At all  Sure  you don t have to act like you re dirt poor  but you need your lifestyle and your apartment to look like your salary is that of an average accountant  If you have any expensive cars   you never take them to your dates  It s tough  and you will have to overtly lie about what you do for living  and hide your main bank account  If you must have expensive hobbies   set up a separate small apartment for them  one only you will know about  When do you  come out of the closet   as a secret millionaire     Ideally   never  Yes  it truly sucks to have such secrets from a person you love  But unfortunately money corrupts most people  Only a few fortunates do not experience this power of money over them  and I happen to be one of those people  I do not respond to flattery  threats or bribery  you cannot buy me  And because of this I am extremely attentive to how wealth changes a person  And knowing what I know  having seen what I seen  in your situation I would either never admit to my real income  or when there is sufficient trust between my partner and I  only then would I admit that I am wealthier than I made my partner believe earlier  But I still won t disclose my true wealth  Keeping such secrets is well worth it    you will never be bitterly disappointed in the person you cannot stop loving  The behaviour you re describing here is despicable  this is the reason men completely stopped trusting women  and the reason why real abusers and rapists could get away with their crimes  after something like this i would never speak to that person again  even if she were the mother of my children  I would no longer consider her human  Take care  You re a smart dude  you ll figure it all out one way or another  You ll never find a true friend unless you do spend time investing your time in people  and you do need to be patient for this ,1,2

And women want to know why men today don t want to commit ,1,0
The exact same thing happened to me brother  I went through the exact same thing  My ex lied i physically threatened to harm her because she didn t want me to see our son  After my son died when he turned 17 she still refused to let me see his corpse  not a single effing lawyer was willing to help me  7 years later I still dont know what she did with my son s body  every time i tried to call her  the cops would come over and arrest me for breaking the court order of no contact ,1,0
it s fucking infuriating   ,1,1
She can be charged with abuse of due process,1,1
I m sorry you went through this and it s sad but how much the system can be abused  I m going through a divorce and prenup could ve saved me and would highly recommend anyone to consider ,1,0

TRO s have been an effective weapon against men for 40 years  decades ago I joined a men s group that researched it thoroughly for years      feminists  LEO s  dirt bag lawyers and the courts all working in cahoots     and it became a big dynasty build in government      not to mention it s a big 2A issue     even if there was no actual violence  like  harassment   you will loose your weapons and loose the ability to ever own any      we actually got a well respected female psychiatrist to testify in court that her female client told her her attorney  pushed and coached  her on how to set up a false  domestic complaint and incident      it was ironic to watch over the years as Cops  Lawyers  Judges and Politicians also fell victims to it      as one Judge freind told me it was completely unconstitutional as they  transmute normal legal standards of  due process and proof between civil and criminal charges law        and then said   good luck getting that gravy train reformed as no higher court will touch it with a ten foot pole       even when the women get caught red handed in false complaints they never get prosecuted     as that would be  bad for business ,1,2

 TechLead 10 10 I know you are talking American data  but factor in that your 1  figure can reflect that Domestic Violence reporting is infamously  under reported   but it s hard to say  or I don t know  just by how much  but surely but atleast a few more percent  The 25  of Divorces can be inpart explained it s a percentage with in a percentage and that factor can be a higher representational factor in divorces for sure  but your 8  I m not sure I understood you right   Is that 8  figure  8  of false charges within Divorce cases  If so  that would make sense as to why the Domestic Violence percentile as part of Divorces also kind of high  but other ways   8  in general population  I m not sure about that  given how Domestic Violence so sadly   under reported  and the terror  fear and even  sadly  double trauma of the system  trying to report or open up about your circumstances to just have little to nothing done about it and even suffer worse ,1,0
thank you so much for your vulnerability and sharing   I love your work ,1,0
Wao  good eye opener  so much fake and people trying to take money from others   Sometimes one has to admit that going through these sort of experiences  make one realize that it is better that it happenned  so to know who you are living sleeping with    the enemiy  Thanks for sharing and the good advises ,1,0
im sorry tech lead  you should have married an American asian girl  seems like cultural differences since she is from Japan,2,0
What can I say bro   you are not the first one to falsely been accused of domestic violence  nor will you be the last   Feminist will tear their coochies out and set it afire  just to throw their man in jail one night  I know over 26 men  whom I can swear have never displayed an ounce of hostility in their lives but have been taken to jail under false accusations  The law is crooked so are the women,2,0
These days even casual female acquaintances co workers  can ruin you with a complaint to HR along with the new catchphrase  I don t feel safe   It starts a mandatory investigation that will only end one way unless you can somehow disprove her statement  I know someone who works in a large office takes up one floor of a building  and he records audio or video any time he s alone with a female like in an elevator  the break room  walking out to his car  etc  Hit record and slip the phone into a pocket facing out or just hold it inconspicuously even if it s upside down  The idea is to record evidence of nothing happening during that encounter  If she makes something up it will be one of those times with no witnesses  If you re in a  two party state  that doesn t allow you to record another person secretly you could say you found it on your phone and had no idea it was on  At the very least you can show it privately to the right people to secure their bias ,2,0
why he went to jail  cuz of his scams ,1,0
jesus  you don t understand women at all  pls don t get married  read Nietzsche s view on women if u must   Woman s love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love    A woman does not want the truth    her great art is deception  her highest concern is mere appearances and beauty    What inspires respect for woman  and often enough even fear  is her nature  which is more  natural  than man s  the genuine  cunning suppleness of a beast of prey  the tiger s claw under the glove  the naivet  of her egoism  her uneducatability and inner wildness  the incomprehensibility  scope  and movement of her desires and virtues    ,1,0
Man I can hear the pain  Can t make this stuff up  Accused  Jailed  Loss of Son  what s next ,2,0
Best solution is to start a corp LLC to work under and a non profit to hold it s stock plus everything else you ve worked for    If you must  pay yourself minimum wage from the corp LLC    That way  when she divorces you  she ll get virtually nothing since you don t make jack squat and the non profit owns everything  and all that stuff is seen as a liability to you  as it s your duty to take care of it  and not an asset to you that can be grabbed by the gold digger ,1,0
So glad you are better and understanding money can really keep you in trouble ,1,0

 TechLead my man  you got married to a toxic woman  Yes you were baited  Your wife was more than likely coached by her friends and a divorce lawyer  You need to get redpilled  Trust me it will help you out in the long run  I am glad you got yourself a lawyer  Females like these are doing the fake domestic violence reports because it is to their benefits  all in order to have you pay the alimony  child support  they will keep any real estate you have and the kids  Horrible experience but at least now you know in case you find another female later on  I was laughing hard when you said to open up an only fans account since cops will have you strip naked  Also laughed hard when you were happy when your wife left  Kool video bro  Keep em coming ,1,0

This has happened to me too   to make things worse  I had proof of her cheating and no one cared about that because I was falsely labeled an  abuser  I lived in my truck for months going through the kangaroo court  The guy she was cheating with disappointed her  she dropped my restraining order and wanted me back     absolutely rotten human being she is  However  she got my kids and some unearned money regardless   She later admitted she was coached to do this by feminist orientated  woman s shelter advocate through DHS,1,0
You are so better off as a single guy you are working towards a better future your child will reap the rewards,1,0

Well i can understand your situation  There is something very wrong with your wife  That s why i am no fan  liberated  females from  advanced  countries  Police violation of humans rights is wide spread in America   Especially if we are non whites   I have seen on media so many cases of American police brutalities and violation of human rights  America   the so called cradle of Democracy and human rights at least to me is mere joke   I have no desire even to visit that country  You shouldn t have married  that crazy and abusive Japanese woman ,1,0

The false domestic abuse scenario happened to me as well   The system is so stacked against men its a very corrupt system and ruins your job your business and your future,1,0
Your ex wife is a witch  You should stay far from her  You should also press charges against her for what she did to you or file a lawsuit against her  Finally file for custody of your son ,2,0
Attorneys are counseling people to do this  My Ex did this to me   He lied in court on the stand to the judge   I went to the DA and was told that they do not try perjury in divorce custody cases   So it is unethical attorneys doing this they know their client cannot be tried and sadly they go there in order to win in divorce custody cases   It doesn t just happen to men   It happens to women as well   Unethical lawyers are behind this strategy they should lose their license to practice law   Good advice when things go toxic just leave   I lost my job and became homeless because of the false allegations he made  It took me 7 years to get my life back   He turned our daughter against me   I have learned about narcissistic personality disorders and anti social personality disorders   People that abuse court systems in order to exact revenge usually have a personality disorder   Learn about these disorders and stay far away from them   My advice ,2,0
Better u should move to another country where laws are not that much harsh for u,1,0
You is a legend bro,1,0

Sorry to hear about your crazy situation  Your problem was your choice of woman and how you allowed her to treat you in your relationship  It escalated  or rather her disrespect for you  over time  What you think is respectable about you is what men respect about other men   these are things you understand well and you are logical about it  Women are wired differently  and much like men  they re all different and you happened to get a rotten one and then you trained her that it s ok to disrespect you because you grew up where men treated women differently  but the laws and the environment were very different  which were suitable for those relationships  but they re not anymore in today s environment  You spend so much time analyzing tech  crypto  coding  wealth management  So you should have respect for people who understand a subject deeply vs those who assume they know because they ve heard of it superficially  Psychology and building relationships in the modern world is just as complex of a topic as engineering and trading  There s a bit of luck to it  sure  But it s significantly easier to have luck on your side at all times if you re well prepared  You love deep dives into topics  Awesome  Have someone train you on relationships  There are great coaches who can help you build a relationship where you re in control  should you want another relationship  Good luck ,2,0

I have been thru the same thing  and I was innocent to and when her lawyer wins the divorce  she gets a big alimony check and since most of the time we have to pay his fees also his fees will be 5  fold more than your lawyer s fees was  and he did nothing but play the tape ,1,0
Like  I ve been abused before  so I understand why the system works on such a hair trigger  since the risk of the victim being massively assaulted or even murdered after police are involved or if they try to leave are astronomical  that being said  this is horrifying  and we definitely need ways of defending against false claims and of getting actual justice for those falsely accused  to deincentivize people from pulling these stunts  I m so sorry this happened to you and your son  I can see being a bitter monster to a partner  but to do it in such a traumatizing way for your own child in their most formative years  that s a special kind of awful ,1,0
I m sorry that happened to you  I wish you the best ,1,1

She has a bigger issue then you  She maybe doesn t know it yet but later it will ketchup on her  People like that end alone or in a fake deceitfull relationship  You now know what red flags are and what you never want to happen again and that s a key to a real mutual loving relationship ,1,0

Marriage can be a blessing and a curse  I once went to a funeral for the passing of a family friend and his ex wife  children  and and mother in law were present and the ex wife and mother in law just couldn t stop snickering and laughing the entire time  They were completly void of civility  compassion  and humanity  It made my blood boil watching the deceased mans family put up with them ,4,0
I had a Japanese girlfriend once  Lived with her for a few years  Worst girlfriend ever  Total psycho  Sense of entitlement like I ve rarely seen outside of a Kardashian reality show  She was from Tokyo  and I got the impression her attitude towards men  especially American men was cultural   I knew it was over after an argument where she deliberately tried to provoke me into hitting her   I was smart enough not to marry her or have children  FWIW   Pre nups are worthless   State law determines what your spouse gets  not some bogus pre nup  Same goes for child custody  Your best defense is to NOT GET MARRIED and NOT HAVE CHILDREN  Both are extremely risky  especially if you are young and male with good career prospects  If you feel you must get married and have children  be very selective with your mate in terms of her character  not her attractiveness  Even then  there are no guarantees  You are risking everything   never forget that ,12,3

Yes  she was probably coached  this happened to me several time until i learned  I started recording her when she attacked me  I showed the police the video and 911 calls  She went to jail  i was released  Eventually i gained custody of my kids  5 years later  we are still going to court for custody  It was hard for me to get out of this toxic relationship because i didn t want the family to break apart  I spent 10 years getting abused  as a man  i fell ashamed but God did good in the end  I have my kids  i have a place to live  and I am happy ,1,0

Good video   thank you for sharing your experience ,1,0
Sorry to hear your story  Stay strong  understand they are instructed to do this  they will bait the husband  even into striking out  They are schooled by their lawyers or social workers  It is the same in New Zealand   regardless of the situation if the police get involved they will come and lock up the male of the household   It is in preparation for future court appearances  Divorce procedures   Custody of your child etc  Your arrest record goes against you   Try not to let it consume you  I have been in a similar situation frankly I will never forget and it has taken four years to stop the pain  They say time cure everything four years on I am a broke and broken man on the mend ,1,0

Okay  at first I felt sorry for your wife  Now I think she s a lunatic  what kind of mom would let that happen in front of her son  Your 3 year old must have been so scared  So sorry for what happened to you ,1,0

Only when it happens do we realize that we are living in a totalitarian state ,1,0

Can I guess why she did that  Maybe because you were a miserable person to her  Everybody can see in your videos what kind of character you have  You look like a very toxic guy that is capable of doing anything in his advantage and wants everything his way  Maybe I m totally  in which case I apologise for this  but it s a big probability that she did the right think to a guy like you  But maybe I m wrong ,1,1

My mom claimed domestic violence and took me to domestic violence shelters where I have some PTSD about that experience  She of course lied and about it and my dad had to experience this horrible divorce and my mom fighting for custody and money  It really sucks how this has become a divorce tactic ,55,1
Oh no  I m so sorry this happened  So  this is a divorce tactic your mom used to get custody of you  I can t believe how much incentive there is to do this  Does anyone know about this  It s hard to believe a parent would do that to themselves or even more  their child  I hope things are going well for you and I wonder how many other children have gone through this  Thank you for sharing  I think it s an important experience that people know about and how it effected you as a child  and an adult ,1,
This actually happened to me  however it wasnt a pen  It was my life savings      Ex left  I was like  where are you  are you okay   Turns out she left the country after clearing out our bank account     Then boom  Police at my door  Domestic violance charge and order  Only thing that saved me   She wasn t in the country when she claimed the incident happened    So the cop was like  yea your free to go     However  I was tor d out the home  left homeless  left with savings stolen and Had to leave the country I was living  to go stay with family  even the cop wass like sorry your not under arrest and this sucks so much  but your not allowed in your own home ,1,0

This story is awful  Courts are only there for 1 thing  money  Only in America     Thank God I will never go through this I am gay lol,1,0
Buddy  years ago I went through the same thing  Like you I have never raised a finger against my then wife  However  she had a friend that had taken out a restraining order against her husband and because my wife and I had some stress and arguing well then the friend coached my wife to do the same  How do I know  Well after many years and my son being forever scarred by our issues my ex said that she was coached by that other woman to go after me  She now says that she is very sorry for all of it but the damage was done and I had to move on without my son  Leaving him was hard and later I was accused by him of not wanting to be around him  The American criminal system is so messed up but what is even more messed up is trusting people with your relationship with your spouse  Don t do that ,3,0
I have faced an almost similar situation like you  Long story short  my cousin accused me of tearing 2 cats to death by the neck  and i was restrained in a hell house  via a legal loop hole for 1 year 5 months until i escape  Worst thing is  my cousin s family is rich and powerful  Bringing a case against them is futile  I feel you man  The woman we met are scary and manipulative  I live in Malaysia ,9,1
I have been threw the craziness  I now help others  The courts like the games  it makes them money  If you only knew  I guess your getting first hand knowledge ,1,0

I ve had this happen  It s mind blowing that someone you love and says they love you can be so cruel  deceptive and vile      not because you cheated  lied  physically hurt them or brow beat them  Nope  it s because you made them angry from not  spending enough time  with them  Even though I spent 95  of all free time I had  If what I provided of my time wasn t enough  then just leave  Turns out  she had banged 3 other guys  that I know of  over the course of our 4 year marriage  She didn t develop relationships with them  just banged em  I just don t understand some people  It showed me that people can  say  they love you  but their definition of love doesn t necessarily mean what your definition of it does  It s been 10 years and it still aches when I think too hard about it  Anyways  you re not alone buddy  Even the bitter sweet parts of life have great value and should be appreciated  Peace brother ,320,22
John i m so sorry you had this happen to you  i can t even begin to imagine the pain you went through ,2,
Don t underestimate the number of diabolical and evil people in the world who want to live an easy life without slogging it out and working honestly ,4,
Agreed  positive thoughts your way man,2,
Traumatised  psychopathic people looking for validation and power due to feeling vulnerable and insecure  Unfortunately it s a kind of epidemic in this modern day ,4,
 If what I provided of my time wasn t enough  then just leave  Turns out  she had banged 3 other guys  that I know of  over the course of our 4 year marriage  She didn t develop relationships with them  just banged em    Bro the beta provider role is  shall we say meh in this day and age      It showed me that people can  say  they love you  but their definition of love doesn t necessarily mean what your definition of it does    That s correct  they re all over the manosphere talking about it  men s definition of lurve isn t the same as women s ,1,
Toxic people say they love you but in reality it s what you provide supply them that they love     it could be attention  holidays  nice shiny things    proper love doesn t even register to these people,2,

Learning to let it go with time is the only healing I can recommend  I feel that these type of women who lash out like this with false accusations are so weak  I feel so embarrassed that they and me have in common to be women  It s mind boggling  They pull our reputation down and are just evil bitches  There is always two sides of a story but from what I read from you it definitely sounds like she was unworthy of you  a cheater  which I could never understand and would also never forgive  ,14,
Its a evil world out here,12,
 MrBibu thank you,6,
You are strong  John ,13,
It s amazing how ruthless someone can be   No consideration or compassion for the child in creating a false incident and perpetual chaos within the family for her own selfish gain  May God watch over the child of any mother who behaves so immorally ,40,5

As someone who s divorced and has child support I can also attest that the court system  especially for family related allegations  is very outdated   mildly sexist and unfair for any plaintiff  The only saving grace   rarely   is when you have enough money to buy a better attorney than the other party,5,1

Hi Techlead  new subscriber to your channel  I ve watched a few of your videos  I hope I learn a lot    unfortunately  what you re describing in this video is more common than many people think   there s no actual investigation    I ve had friends who went thru similar things  It can happen to anyone    it really sounds like you deserve a lot better in a woman ,4,0
Thank you for sharing  I was a victim of violence and my ex husband made the lawyers and judges to believe that I am lying  I was kicked  beaten  pushed  cursed  lied to  cheated on  And the worst part he is now writing a book about me using my real name  I filed the police about it  guess the name of the book    How I got rid of a narcissistic gold digger      while I am full time mom and full time developer 60 hours a week  And I don t even get alimony ,1,0
I love this video  So much value  especially the end  ,2,0
 i was kicked out of my apartment for a month  This is why you do not put her name on YOUR apartment  even if she lives there  If the apartment is in your name  and not hers  and she remains there  she is violating the order and it becomes void or else she is forced to leave  Similarly  if you re dining at a restaurant and she shows up  she is the one that must leave,1,0

Hi  firstly I would like to apologise if any of this has been covered in previous comments   I first found your channel looking for advice on faster typing   I am revisiting an old passion  due to unemployment  of pentesting and too slow at coding   If you re interested in my story you need to know that I am 51 yrs old and therefore had a lot of time for arguing   You should also know that after my eldest son was born my wife had post natal depression and I was the primary carer  a legal definition here in the UK   I don t know about the US    I lost custody of him due to a threat of claiming domestic violence     I repeat  a threat  of claiming domestic violence     Not a claim of domestic violence  JUST THE THREAT OF IT       My then wife and I were going through a rough patch   I said   I don t think you are sure about being married to me and or our family life in general   Why don t you take a few days staying at your mum s  get a clear head and then we ll talk    She did   A week later  she came back saying  I do love you  I do want to make it work and I will do whatever it takes    Our son was 2 1 2 yrs old  2 weeks later she told me  maybe she had made a mistake and needed more time apart to think   So  I said  ok  thats fine whatever you need  I ll see you when you get back     Ah   she said   my brother is at my mum s so there s no room for me    Like a trusting fool  I said  OK  I ll go to my parents and we can get some space that way      She had been coached and changed the locks  Posession is               I arranged a meeting with her at the house to talk things over   We agreed to get divorced   I collected my sons belongings and was leaving the house  MY house  that had been in my family for 15yrs  another story   with my son in my arms when she said    if you take one step out of that door with MY SON  I will call the police and report you for domestic violence    Here in the UK  certainly my part of the UK  it is the local constabulary policy on a report of domestic violence from a female against a male  to restrain and remove the male from the scene     SIDE     I know this as I was a victim of extreme  domestic violence  some years later   Regardless of the facts that the female involved  had not a mark on her  because I did nothing to defend myself out of fear of repercussions    a weapon was found at the scene with only her finger prints and my blood on it  I was bleeding requiring 16 staples to the head  covered in bite marks and   dental records proved the ID of assailant   There were 30 plus bite marks and it was described by representation as  a frenzied attack      I WAS HANDCUFFED AND TAKEN TO THE POLICE STATION    Go figure  As you stateside like to say     No charges were brought against me and the woman involved was warned of the ramifications of wasting police time   Phew  justice     Getting back to the main story     A call to the police with a complaint of domestic violence against a male  regardless of ANY family history immediately elevates the female to primary carer   In most custody cases here  primary carer wins   We both knew these facts at the time  mainly because her dad was a police officer   I handed my son over  was reduced to seeing him 2 days per fortnight and half the school holidays until he was 7yrs old   During the ensuing months I paid half of the mortgage and utility bills   I paid an allowance for our sons needs   In the divorce proceedings  I was convinced by my female  might have been a factor  I don t know  barrister to sign over sole ownership of the house  they claimed negative equity    My barrister said I could force the sale of the house but if there was negetive equity  my ex wife and my son would be housed by the council where she was last housed by them   And DAMN  it s a lawless shithole where he d probably not see 20yrs old  Then  she sold the house  made  30k profit and moved 450 miles away to be with a new boyfriend  My contact order  was reduced by the court to one weekend a month and half the school holidays due to the stress of travel on the child  despite me offering to do all the travelling and hire accommodation local to him  again another custody battle story of its own    I was suicidal and clinically depressed for 3 yrs     On a lighter note  and I hope this is the bit that helps people   My eldest son is now 28 yrs old   We live pretty close to each other  just 6 miles apart   Emotionally  we are close  we are strong and we overcame the obstacles   We regularly go airsofting together which involves an hour drive there and an hour back  so we get loads of opportunity to talk   He does like to shoot the sh t out of me though  so i m not sure  is that just a kid thing or am I an assh le DAD ,12,1

Don t get married of have kids in the US  This stuff has been going on for decades  I watched it happen to my dad  He was falsely accused of assault and convicted of it  Pre nups get ignored in court  They claim duress   He wouldn t marry me unless I signed it  He yelled and hit me   They can throw in a DV claim ,1,0
I like how you hide many humorous lines in a serious narration ,2,0
It s incredible and terrifying how she started with you when you didnt have money  But now that you do  it turns out this way  The people in her corner are hyenas to say the least because you know dang well she was coached and urged by others  It s a shame to see a family break apart with a kiddo involved  Two parent home are important  I hope that all that is in the past and that your future is peaceful ,1,0

 Ericka Celiz  If there s two sides of the coin  the police shouldn t have taken him to jail without asking him for his side of the story first  He didn t get a chance to exonerate himself  and this is irrelevant to whether or not he was in the wrong  There are two sides to a story  but it doesn t change the fact the this system is biased and extremely broken ,1,
There s no point ,2,

You have become the Johnny Depp of the coding community     Misleading title  but very good video content  Thanks for sharing your experience  because I have personally known people who have went through this  We software engineers  specially the nerdy ones are very much susceptible to falling into domestic troubles due to poor social skills  I have seen some really intelligent guys earning lots of money  then marrying a hot girl   loosing everything over the marriage  We gotta watch out for the gold diggers  ,1,0
Damn dude  It took a lot for you to air out your stuff like that  But like you said  this topic is quite taboo and deserves more awareness   Thanks for sharing ,1,1
The story sounds weird though  I don t buy the reason you said of why you could track her phone  seems like you were controlling her  Also you mentioned your weak arms  there are plenty of stories of  weak  people abusing others  I m not pointing fingers  just saying it s odd ,2,2

These things happen  I have proof of my wife threatening to kill our daughter  yet for the past 2 5 years I ve only gotten to see my daughter once a week  for which I have to travel to another city 2 hours away  Six days a week I work hard  then on the remaining day I get to play with my 4 5 year old daughter for a few hours  All this time I ve been trying to reconcile with the wife  who had physically attacked me  before  I happened to record her threats  so that our daughter doesn t have to grow up with a single parent ,18,4
 Nick Treees Thanks,1,
 Harshdeep S Jawanda I wish you the best my friend,2,
 Nick Treees 1  Haven t gone to courts yet  except to ask the court to restore my marital rights  that s a thing in India    2  In India the laws completely favour the woman  she only has to accuse  he has to prove his innocence  despite the fundamental principle of the Indian Penal Code being the opposite  innocent until proven guilty    3  My lawyer says that Indian courts often don t allow video audio recordings as evidence  Then WTF is evidence  Nobody wants the hassle of testifying in court  there was an eyewitness too   but  the courts don t compel anybody to testify  So it s just 10 15 years of court cases while the daughter grows up with her mother  if she lives that long    I pay for it all    Cops refuse to register cases against women by their husbands  I heard from a close female friend that a mutual male friend was beaten black and blue by his wife and when he went to the cops to register a complaint  the laughed him out of the station  These are my friends from high school  have no romantic entanglement  so it s highly unlikely that the friend who told me the story was lying ,3,
Idk the whole story but if true then damn  You had a shitty lawyer  If I had proof like that no way I m losing my kid  Hope things workout for you ,2,
Actually i believe her lol,2,0
Yes Been there DV  Yes Record everything  Great tips ,1,0
Sorry that happened to you   glad you re out of that be blessed   thanks for sharing ,1,0

You had so many things going against you it s hard to count  1   you re a man 2   you live in California  3   you re guided by rational thinking and assume that everyone else is guided by same 4   you re not a  favored minority  that can feed off of victimhood status  Etc  etc ,4,0

My friend  what you went through is identical to what I went through  except it happened to me 6 years ago and has just gotten worse since the beginning for me  When I say worse  I mean a lot worse  I really hope your situation ends at this point for you now especially since your ex moved out of the country  My ex  on the other hand  is an attorney and is dedicating her life to either have me dead or in jail forever ,284,44

Bro  just know whatever happens ur the right person and are at higher moral ground  This should give u strength to face whatever comes at u  And as a guy  I think ur best bet is to record everything and all conversations u have with her  It s hard but u would have to take the fight to her  BTW how are things rn ,2,

bruh rip,1,
What the hell is she trying to do ,12,
What is she doing  We want to know more ,7,
Does the  domestic violence  in the US include verbal or only physical ,18,5
In the U S   de facto domestic violence can be construed to be anything at all the woman in the relationship doesn t like or agree with   If she s cheating him and he is offended or disagrees  or if he hit her swinging fist with his stationary face  if he s in the room at the same time she s unhappy about anything  that can be construed to be  domestic violence    And  yes  he s usually guilty  and no  she s rarely guilty  facts are interesting but irrelevant ,4,
We have a biased family law system  whatever she feels is domestic and if you have a male judge or female judge ,4,
Domestic violence can also be psychological and emotional,4,
Same thing happened to my friend  It s not on ,1,0
I can think of at least one reason abuse allegations are higher in divorce cases lol,3,0
This happens in the UK as well  Honestly if you are male do not get married ever  50  of marriages end in divorce  75  are instigated by the wife  It is not a fair system for men  the divorce courts will hang a man out to dry  Men win custody of children in contested cases less than 5  of the time ,1,1
Good thing it s ILLEGAL to secretly record anyone in my state,1,0
Getting married is the most dangerous thing you do in your life  If you get it wrong  it s a life sentence  And there s no way to prevent getting it wrong ,1,1
My  ex  tried something like this  worse actually  4 years into joint custody that had been contested at various times with her using lies to gain advantage the whole time  Eventually it backfired  After being unable to freely see our daughter for 8 months I was granted full custody with a move away and the mother was ordered to have supervised visitation only  For the past 10 years our daughter has lived with me and her mom has visitation every other weekend and various holidays  Many women are given the belief that abusing the system is a slam dunk easy win  but that is not always the case and abusing the system comes with risks  Of course the penalties for cynically abusing the system and perjuring yourself should be more severe considering the jeopardy it creates and the many innocent victims it creates  but at least we have a system where there is some due process  I hope you are able to maintain contact with your son  clearly your ex was only thinking of herself and not your son and that s what the courts focus on  what is in the best interests of your child ,3,0
SHE NEEDED THAT PHONE  because she WAS ADDICTED TO THE  FEED  AND    inow don t know about buying   i mean shoping fo  I MEAN pur   i mean BUY  ER getta WIFEY aaaaaaaaaaaa    NO you GOT to get a PRENUP and a WOMAN YOU   CAN   TRUST   A traditional feminine GODLY  real WOMAN  ,1,0
While she was sleeping soundly you were going through all of that    she didnt go through no trouble  she had already planned it because she is a coward,2,1
TLDR  Never marry ,1,0
your ex wife was is crazy  ill never marry ,1,0
best is to live the single life cause it can happen to anyone   unless you meet the right person and still you need call prenup where you won t get kicked out of your apartment   put that in the contract too,1,3

She went ballistic over her phone because that is where all of the information of her infidelity was  So glad you got rid of her  All liars are useless and evil ,1,1
Im pretty sure you are not allowed that card in the wallet either,1,1
   WARNING    Be careful with prenups  I m hearing they re starting not to work because women are starting to claim that they signed the prenup under duress and if the judge is dumb enough  they ll ignore the prenup ,5,2
Sorry   Your story is similar to mine except the argument we had wasn t over taking a pen  it was a over a multi year disrespect she had towards my fragile 4 foot 6 inch immigrant mother  My dad passed away leaving my mom behind a Greek  immigrant widow who could not speak English fluently and could not drive   She lived alone on my dad s  500 social security check    I felt bad experiencing  my mom living alone in her elder years and wanted to have her visit us occasionally give her companionship and to spend time with my three children  My wife was so rude she would leave the house when I brought my mom over to visit and would not allow my mom to visit with us any extended time even though I had no problems letting her parents and sisters stay with us for weeks at a time  My mom passed away this May and left me with a broken heart   I will live with the guilt that I was not able to provide my mom with a better life in her last years   I stayed in the marriage for my children and for the hope things would improve  When I continued to work on improving the marriage she would double down and employ psychologically damaging passive aggressive tactics to force me into filing for a divorce  She would avoid having conversations with me  made plans to visit her sister s out of state leaving with less than a day s notice  withdrew all intimacy and  asked me to break promises I made to do things with my children  Her intention was to force me to divorce her so she could blame the divorce on me to my children to make her look good in the eyes of the community   I stayed and bore her passive aggressive abuse  When she realized I was faithful to our marriage and that her tactics would not work she employed a false DV claim to remove me from my home and take my children from me while at the same time creating the false impression that she was justified in the eyes of her parents and children to file for the divorce  She did this months after I paid off our mortgage when I was 54 years old  Never have I experienced so much evil  I would like to start an advocacy group for men who have gone through this kind of hell   Each year the court system destroys the lives of innocent men with court cases such as mine with no proof except for the false claims of women playing a winner take all strategy which causes psychological damage to their children  their spouse and others in the extended family  Any other men out there who have been in this kind of situation   please share your story  ,8,1
so did she clean out your bank account with her exit strategy    The things that happened to you isn t as uncommon as your search data suggests  I spent more money than I spent on my first home to pry my ex s claws from my children  She tried to provoke me  When words didn t work she hit me and almost landed herself in jail  She called the cops on me and almost got screwed in the process ,1,2
Thanks for sharing that  I am sorry about your plight  I guess we may all have partners before who got nasty for reasons beyond our comprehension at the time of occurance  Most would never find out the reason but I m glad you did and are still clear about it from all angles  You have my support bro  And if times gets dark then think about all these comments here that are supporting you ,3,1
Sorry to hear you had to go through this  Thank you for sharing as well giving down advice to anyone else whom might be experiencing or experienced this  You re really courageous  Glad that you re doing much better now and wish that this just makes you stronger  You have my biggest support  virtually  from Singapore   ,69,8

 stephen barter No  I didn t say that at all    I m sure she was aggressive too     There s so many young couples like that these days   They re trying to be so perfect and smart to the world and they re weirdos behind closed doors   Look at the Gabby Petito case  same exact thing   They beat the crap out of each other constantly ,5,
 Jaydapp also if you don t think threatening a woman that you ll take her phone will cause her to freak out   go ahead and try it  see what happens lol ,7,
 stephen barter Don t tell me  tell the person who fabricated it ,1,
 Jaydapp cool story bro,4,
ehhh     He s not as innocent as he s making himself sound   I m sure she s not either but I ve been in law enforcement and I ve seen a lot of this  I ve watched a lot of his videos and I ve very intently listened to him telling his story   He s not being completely forthcoming here    Oh  I just happened to remember we shared our location on Google maps     ha  NO WAY that s how that happened   Also  his talk about the pen  and then he innocently throws in how he had her phone  etc     I think I have a pretty solid grasp on his personality also and I can read into it quite a bit  There s a lot more here  I promise   Also  from his description of what happened  he did have opportunity to show up to court on those restraining orders and offer his defense but it sounds like he just didn t show on all occasions of those hearings   Temporary restraining orders only last until they have that court date where he can defend himself ,9,
I m confused  I thought he has been divorced over a year now ,35,3
I think he tried to get back with her before she left him for good    not sure,2,

 Over Yonder TechLead said he takes credit for his employees  work in another video   I  think  he was joking lol ,2,
 Gabe Can you give an example ,14,
 Over Yonder Tech Lead is the horrible person  Not his spouse     Tech lead rips off other people s products  and sells it as his own ,8,
If she s such a terrible person as tech lead describes  then I think she wouldn t be able to handle the hate she receives in the comments     she would get roasted,16,
Yooo seriously that would fucking be dope to see    Make it happen,9,
That would take actual work,34,

Overall good advice  but don t expect the prenup to work   This is because if the women claims that there wasn t a attorney present when she signed it  the prenup goes straight into the garbage ,1,1
What a shithole is USA  I cannot believe it s like this  In my Middle Eastern country if someone s wife does this  police will arrest the wife not the poor man ,2,1
Happened to me  Lost my daughter over it  Prove they were lying    that s your best defense ,1,1
Haha you are so funny  by faking it you are making it  You should be a millioner by now after all these videos and views ,1,1
Sometimes youtube recommendations algorithm has advantages  I do remember you mentioned in one of your videos that one day you got Home  your EX and Kid were disappeared without any reason  Keep trashing yourself  No one believes you ,1,0

OMG  I don t believe this  If you are telling the truth  I am deeply sorry for what happened to you    Do you plan to take any actions against your ex or will you just let it go ,1,1
Imagine if the pet was the one behind all of this,1,1
Do you ever put a tech video   Or just self bragging  ,1,1
Thank you for sharing your story   Sadly  this resonates all too well with me  but with a girlfriend   I was completely innocent and no charges were filed thanks to surveillance video  but her false allegations initiated a lengthy and exhaustive DoD investigation since I hold a security clearance   After a two and a half year long ordeal  my clearance was reinstated  but six weeks after losing my software development position   You are spot on when you say the system is ripe for abuse   Those who take advantage of this broken system must be held accountable  and that won t happen unless those of us who were injured take action   Filing a false police report or providing false information on a TRO application may constitute perjury  but in my experience attorneys avoid taking a case like this   Civil action is certainly a viable option   Consider challenging the arrest and submit a petition of factual innocence  also consider obtaining a copy of your RAP sheet  Record of Arrest and Prosecutions  from the DOJ   Instructions are on DOJ s website   It s good to know what s on your record because law enforcement agencies sometimes make reporting mistakes ,1,0
 why do men not want long term relationships    because of this,12,1
Are you 50  Stop doing drugs,2,1

Damn sounds really familiar   I had a run in with a crazy librarian a while back   So I was studying software engineering and used to frequent this library a lot  once she saw me driving a nice car   Started distracting me like crazy  but I wasn t interested in her  I went there to study so i ignored her   A few months later I decided to ask her out for a coffee  valentines loneliness  and she went BALASTIC  she rejected me   Made me look bad in front of the librarians  they started coming up to the quiet study room and checking on my work and eventually banned my car from the library parking lot   The girl was fuckings nuts ,1,1

Old joke that I heard in the 1990 s went something like this   A man goes into a store to buy a Barbie doll for his daughter for Christmas     He asked the shop assistant   how much is that Barbie in the window       Which Barbie   We have Barbie goes to the gym for  19 95   Barbie goes to the ball for  19 95   Barbie goes shopping for  19 95  Barbie goes to the beach for  19 95   Barbie goes nightclubbing for  19 95   and finally  we have divorced Barbie for  395         Well  why is the divorced Barbie so much more expensive than all the others       It s obvious   the clerk replied   divorced Barbie comes with Ken s house  Ken s car  Ken s boat  and Ken s furniture  ,10,1

Just when I was about to take him seriously  plugs in crypto as the craziest  ROFL   ,2,1
I personally went through this same experience with my ex wife  She had alleged so many domestic violence allegations that eventually the judge saw a pattern on her part and they eventually dismissed all charges and i was able to get my charges expunged  I moved out of state and moved as far away as i could from her  Needless to say  this was not her first time she had made false allegations like this  Women like that have red flags that NEVER should be ignored  The justice system has its flaws but do trust in God and the truth will reveal itself  Always watch yourself and be cautious who you let in close to your circle  Stay safe  stay alert and stay alive ,4,1
 Never laid a finger on her once   damn I feel bad for you  never had any action in 4 years  That must mean your kid is someone elses  THATS ROUGH BRUH ,2,0
Even with an arrest warrant  cops need a search warrant to enter your home  otherwise it s a slam dunk lawsuit   also  if they had no arrest warrant or probable cause  it means more lawsuits  the department and city will likely settle if u sue in time   u could ve legally AND MORALLY filed a restraining order on her too at some point s  ,4,0
You mention having a pre nuptial agreement  At the same time  it defeats the purpose of getting married to begin with  which was originally to bring the assets of 2 spouses together  not separate them  I suppose it s just one more indication that modern social values are incompatible with the foundations of traditional marriage ,5,0
That pen must be so valuable to you   that it was worth the psychological punishment and emotional abuse you exact on your own wife  Psychological and emotional abuse is also abuse   It is clear now why she ran away ,1,1

The number one characteristic to look for in a spouse is kindness  And not how kind they re to you when the two of you are  in love   but how kind they re to their  enemies   Because if your spouse or partner reclassifies you as an enemy  their treatment of you will change drastically   naval,161,5
They are all kind until they need something  Said by my grandma ,5,
Amen  Lesson learned by me   I could have seen it   I should have seen it     eventually  I did see what I could have and should have seen by the way she treated others     If anyone else is reading this and has a girlfriend boyfriend fianc  who spends time and effort to hurt their  enemies  even when there is nothing to gain for them to do so    run away now  fast      Those people carry a darkness inside of them ,8,
pretty much this  Always look at how a person treats the poor and bad people  That reveals who they are under the persona ,7,
Naval Ravikant is very wise,3,

It s true my ex shoved me into a wall and then got a restraining order on me when she pretty much assaulted me and is way more overweight than me and i m a skinny gamer guy ,2,1
This is exactly my exact same life story  There was never any evidence or police reports  pictures or anything no evidence because I didn t even touch her  She s just mad and i m happy the marriage is over  Thanks for this tip  unfortunetly I deleted the videos of her acting insane  But i m the one who has charges ,23,0
I never believe women when they accuse a man of abusing her   From what I ve seen  the allegations are usually false ,1,0
The Unplugged Alpha by Richard Cooper covers all of this and how to not fall into the trap   I ve lived all of this in 2 X shitty marriages  It s all about them taking everything and more from you and moving onto the next victim without any remorse  it s an evolutionary process ,4,0
A woman can be aggressive to her spouse then she can become a victim when she wants to win   On another note a woman comes off as a victim then finally she becomes the aggressor,8,0
Dang this can happen to all men   this makes my blood boil   you sound relatively calm about it   stay strong bro ,162,3
I hate people abusing the system  What these a   oles are doing is that eventually the system will change to prevent abuse and maybe people who really need it will not have the protection they need on time  In my experience  people are really getting abused don t usually go to the authorities  I ve seen more people going there with false claims  Abused people are usually really scared of the abuser and possible retaliation to even attempt it ,14,

Wow dude  that s insane  I hope that by sharing your story more people can speak up about this horrendous behaviour  Take care ,22,0
08 21 this is the most important information for married men  men to know of ,1,0
She definitely was trying to have you hit her so she can sue you and get money out of it  Avoid her at all costs  No more contact  just your children  otherwise she will continue using the children  and your need to see them to keep you exposed to her  Don t let her trigger you ,3,0
One other thing  always keep  the most important numbers in your head  For a smart guy like you  this should not be a problem  There is no substitute for this  Maybe I am a bit old school but believe me  these vital pieces of information are worth pounds of gold and have saved the day for me many times ,36,0
Your video is great  except in a different video  you said that your wife just left you without giving you any reasons and took your kid the Japan  In reality  you knew she wanted you out and why  If you have been arrested for that  then you were quite  painfully aware  So  because of this discrepancy  no thumbs up  On a slightly different note  I never had a significant other who would treat me this way  But then again  none of them were coached by legal council how to entrap into something like that  Sorry to hear about all your trouble  and if were you  I would steer clear of this person  your ex wife  as much as possible ,1,0
i hate to say it  love is like a fantasy  the girls i have encountered with in my life  just made me feel i am a bad person  so now i decide to not have any romantic relationship with anyone ,13,3
No wonder guys don t want to get married these days  and so many single moms out there ,24,2
Women won t acknowledge this  They want the authority of a man  the advantages of a woman and the accountability of a child ,6,
This was a great video  thank you for sharing that  an experience from that part of your life man   currently going through a similar situation   not with a girlfriend or boyfriend or anything but I have a roommate that I kind of don t have any other choice but to live with because I m in a 3 4 house right now  good news is I can move legally  the thing  was I didn t have a choice as to who moved in here with me they are extremely toxic and  passive aggressive to say the least  constantly doing things in hopes that I will physically take matters in to my own hands   which is something I might have done years ago as my not so wise younger self  and they are well aware that it s something I might have done in the past  but now I just play my cards with a lot more brains and this they don t know  and think the next step will be to take some of the advice in this video until I am financially able to move out ,1,0
I build properties for mostly wealthy people  and for most young men these days they request a hidden CCTV system in every room even bathrooms just because of this,3,1
Why would they ,1,
Thank you  TechLead  for sharing your story ,6,1
This happened to me  except the woman actually got her 8 year old daughter to call the police to make it more convincing   The woman was a fired social worker and familiar with the court system   I did not have money for a lawyer or knowledge of the legal system    All my stuff was stolen  It was all over verbal parenting disagreement for our infant 3 month old son   I didn t get joint custody of him until 10 months after the fake domestic violence accusation   I m sorry you had to go through this  TechLead ,1,1
Same thing happened to me when my son was 8 months old here in Australia  Its a messed up system ,3,1

The worst mistake you did was signing a contract with her  Marriage contract   Next time if you want to have kids with the woman make sure she lives overseas so that way you still have freedom here in USA and also free of liability  And if you want to feel the so called love then watch Bollywood films there are plenty of Romeo Juliet romance  ,2,0
Wish you all the best and for goodness sake  forget about reconciling with her  for the sake of your kid  This is OVER   ,2,0

 Shivanshu Bansal one of the many things which you wrote happen  I was just too lazy to write all of them out  or even copy and paste  but I replied because the way you are saying it makes it sound like this happens whith everybody in a marrige   If you don t want to marry then dont its your decision  but if you have enough time then please read your previous comments and it will be clear that you are saying that the said things happen to everyone  Also  its not  one the things  its  one of the things   polish on your English if you have to   the solution that you have is like  a car can hit you  thus you should not use zebra crossings ,1,

By  taking  your ex wife s cellphone and declaring you wouldn t return it unless she returned your pen  you likely just publicly admitted to committing one or two criminal offenses  larceny and extortion  As defined by the National Incident Based Reporting System    Larceny   The unlawful taking  carrying  leading  or riding away of property  from the possession  or constructive possession  of another person    Extortion    To unlawfully obtain money  property  or any other thing of value  either  tangible or intangible  through the use or threat of force  misuse of authority  threat of criminal prosecution  threat of destruction of reputation or social standing  or through other coercive means   These two offenses were what you were most likely arrested for based on your story  Since both offenses were reported to be committed against your ex  the offenses are prosecuted in court with the additional weight of  domestic violence     Law enforcement are required by law to handle cases involving two intimate partners in specific ways because of the seriousness of the matter    Your ex made a legitimate report based on the story you just told  You may have never physically assaulted her  but the sphere of domestic violence extends beyond to psychological emotional and economic abuse as well that can take the form of verbal intimidation  harassment  and threats that can put into question an individuals safety  security  and welfare into question  which should be taken seriously as more often then not are indicators that are highly correlated with future physical abuse   Statistics also support that law enforcement take all reports seriously  It is estimated that 1 in 3 women will be the survivors of physical abuse committed by a partner and that more than half of these crimes go unreported  These numbers do not reflect cases such as harassment  larceny  or extortion   In terms that the average individual may understand  in the hypothetical case when you were still working for a corporation  if your boss  who had complete control over your salary and employment status  which you also have a confrontational history with  took your personal cell phone  physically kept you from obtaining it unless you did so by force  and threatened to keep it from you indefinitely until you returned her pen you took  would you not feel justified in reporting such an incident to Human Resources or even law enforcement if HR refused to act    You obviously have the intellect to understand that your argument that the system is open to be abused and betaken advantage of by false claims is a logical phallacy  slipper slopes can be found anywhere and everywhere  and if your argument is true shouldn t we abolish all crimes so none can be falsely accused and face situations like yours  Better 10 guilty men go free then have 1 innocent man suffer goes the saying after all    What you experienced is clouded by your privileged background  To many  where a cellphone is their only lifeline and one of the most valuable items they own  the threat of such a loss is significant  Why should the law treat those of greater wealth differently ,1,1
Red PILL awakening  Sorry to hear your experience ,1,0
Come to think of it  one has to wonder what is incentivizing the entire judicial system  There s no way there aren t enough  bros  or just plain rational dudes in the police force  jeez  They themselves must be being coached to take a particular stance    As they answer to superiors  their superiors must in some way be gaining by this coalition maligning the interests of men ,1,0
Women   I stay far away from them ,1,2
The red pill is real  It was a setup all along  She married for the divorce  Your value makes you a target  You need to educate yourself on female behavior ,2,1
Thats why they tell you not to get married and guys are just leaving the whole thing     There is plenty of evidence    and its all over the internet   and prenubs dont always work   and why marry someone you dont trust doesn t make sense,1,0
The me too movement has resulted in many false accusations  Good advice  Thanks for sharing ,3,2
My mom s second husband pulled this kind of BS with me and had me arrested for  threatening violence  and then filed and renewed restraining orders against me  All of his children are attorneys   It destroyed the relationship I had with my mom too  and she died last year   There is no justice in the US justice system  but there are definitely a lot of abusers ,178,7
Condolences,3,
Stop being so violent then and u wont have to worry about being arrested ,1,
Thats hard  I m sorry man ,1,
My prayers to you bro  what happened to you is very bad  Take care and I hope you are in a good place now ,13,
This video is extremely disturbing to me on so many levels   no wonder men are ditching marriage   My best advice as a woman is to really get to know them before making any real commitment and PAY ATTENTION to red flags and get a friggin pre nup   Think with the organ of reason and logic not reproduction ,1,1
Wow  chilling  So sorry to hear this ,2,0
Wow  An incredible story  and yes  with valuable lessons for all as well  Kinda sad for those of us who believe in the instituition of marriage  but this is part of the grim reality of what can happen when things go south in the relationship  I must say though  for a relatively young guy  Techlead has had quite a life      as a millionaire ,19,1
The problem is not marriage per se  The problem lies in the person you chose as a partner  If you chose a partner with no morals  no standards and no dignity you should not be surprised if things like that happen to you  Or put simple  If you fight with the pigs don t complain about getting dirty  This is a cultural problem which is furthered by a society that values people too much by their productivity over an all around education that includes mental and emotional maturity ,4,
Would be interesting to hear her side of the story as well,6,1
I have Been following your moves and it s all great  Bitcoin and a number of popular digital assets have been dropping in value over the past 24 hours  as bitcoin has slipped below the  34K handle  The entire market capitalization of all 10 000  crypto assets in existence has shed billions during the overnight trading sessions  and the crypto economy currently rests at  1 38 trillion  down more than 6  since yesterday  This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure  With the current price I will advise investors to trade before the bull run  as I still strongly believe BTC is going to enter the  70k SD record before year ending  although that s my personal opinion   I ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of Richard mcdole   a pro trader who runs a training program for investors newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works  to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more bitcoin  with his program i went from having 1 3btc to 9 3btc in just 5 weeks  You can reach him on TE LE GRAM     Richardmcdole    let s make the best of whatever we can ,1,0
I suspect you  as a millionaire  of course  may be dealing with a Cluster B   Good luck  sir ,1,1

Well he uses deceptive language  I would say false domestic violence charges  so others would call that actually domestic violence    I m to weak to hit someone    I tracked her down to the police station  So you tracked your wife s phone to see if shes reporting you for a fight he started but its strange shes recording a fight he started but is to weak to fight but some might call that domestic violence  Alot of deseptive language,4,
That sounds like a recipe for never ending tribal horseshit,2,

i think this is one of most valuable video you ve ever released  thanks for your tips,1,1
This video may have accidentally taught a lot of women to entrap men for money  Men  be vigilant  the worse enemy is the one who sleeps next to you ,1,1
yup been there  she thought it was hilarious  even tried to get money,1,1
Sorry to hear that  the tech lead  It s a horrible story and I may lose my sleep tonight   ,2,1
This is so unfair and harmful to society  but one can only imagine the experience of having it personally happen to you  Only God s justice is perfect  but this type of thing really makes you think whether state laws and courts are really the best we can come up with ,1,1
Lmao bro just blogging his downfall wtf,1,1
The system is crooked just as your ex wife  U deserve better against that piece of sh  t,1,1
Dont get married in America boys   Not because  marriage  is bad  but because government controlled marriage has nothing to do with love  family  or children   it has all to do with them taking your money  growing power over you and to corrupt the original institution of marriage,1,1
  I m watching you for a years   I know you re a good father    You love your son with all your heart    God   i feel your pain  Please be safe and stay strong ,12,1

I ve seen multiple women have emotional breakdowns and ruin mens lives over the most trivial bullshit because they court systems allows them  Glad I m not murrican  the whole thing is a joke ,1,0
This reinforces my stance on marriage    don t do it unless she has equal or more money than you  Just ask Halle Berry s husband   ,1,2
Your wife sounds like a total wacko   It is for women like her that feminism gets a bad name   I ve known a woman like that   She s incredibly unfaithful and found it easier to fabricate charges against her husband so that she can justifiably leave him ,1,1
Bro  your life is going to hell tbh   ,1,1
This is what us poor people deal with too lol  Surprised you had to do that,1,1

Great content  ,1,1
Tip 4 really made me think about my choices of friends ,8,0
Man  it s obviously that she married you to get money from you  She planned everything  even the video    Don t stupid next time  Take the RED PILL and be happy  You are in the high value man position  Checkout the channel Fresh Fit  they will explain everything  They will turn you from beta to alpha male  or at least you will understand how thinks work ,1,0

Great advice  100   no proof is necessary for them to make reports,2,0
I am from Singapore  I cannot even remotely imagine why the laws in the US are like that  Honestly  it s absurd ,8,2
Its an extremist overreaction to a previous problem of domestic violence  In the US this kind of things happens a lot  Its similar with alimony and other laws  Whenever someone tries to make the system fair and balanced  radical feminists groups lobby against it ,1,
 I installed a home camera    Anytime there s an argument  start recording  In my opinion relationships if you are compelled to do such things don t make any sense  Trust is the defining factor that decides whether a relationship works out or not  On the other hand it s also a bit risky not to protect yourself in such ways  The system is rigged against us men  that s just how it is ,182,9
Trust will get you put in jail  Best to have a camera   record ,2,
 LMesser quick thinking but flawed in practice  It can t be published if there s criminal proceedings  media bans  etc    Also  consider the leverage you would need to get anyone to publish about it in the current culture if those laws didn t exist   it s slim  You d need a provocative news source interested in presenting objective truths  sky news  etc ,1,
 The Zen Social Worker Can still be used as leverage with threat of publication  all is fair   ,2,
True  if I felt the need to do that I would leave,1,
I think he s trying to counter variables that can t be accounted for or predictive ,2,
System is so rigged against men that the video you think is going to save you by showing the truth  likely isn t admissible  The lie about what you re being charged with will be different enough from the actual event   it ll cost you a lot to try and get it brought before a judge   Not legal advice  just friendly conversation ,27,
Judiciary system on this planet is impotent  ,1,1
Marriage is just handing over half of everything you ever worked for  and a huge chunk of all your time  energy  and vitality for the opportunity of one selfish crazy person to take it away  and add insult to injury in the process    your odds of divorce are 50  and for the 50  who dont get a divorce most are miserable  cheating  or just dead inside  Money can be the root of all evil  but for men the fear of being alone is the root of all misery ,1,1

If you are smart  you don t ,6,
The thing is  we are not supposed to  There are some people in the elite who are meant to procreate but not the majority of men  These days they dont kill you  they just wait for you to die while providing some increase to GDP that gonna end up being their grandchildren property anyway ,9,

 Molamolafish lol  sounds good to me   ,1,
you mean a god among men ,2,
Been there  Since you made the first video about your wife I m still going through the court system ,1,2
The craziest thing about it is someone you trust who you ve done no great wrong to  will just flip on you and destroy your life and think it s okay  Risk the safety of your child and silly your reputation  Because of what  They re unhappy  Only the lowest level of hell is appropriate for such conscious evil,1,
She was definitely coached   It happens to millions of us   That s called the silver bullet  It s a standard tactic in custody and divorce  The women falsley accuses the man of domestic violence   She sufferes no consequences and in fact is incentivised and profits  Men have no presumption of innocence because the order of protection can then be used as a weapon  You can thank Joe Biden and VAWA for that ,1,0
Unfortunately  false claims against men in divorce courts is very common  I work as a social worker and I ve encountered several situations involving children where the wife would make demonstrably false claims  It s really scary how common that is  and from my vantage point  I get far more details than mere hearsay  Thankfully  some children are older and when meeting a court mandated psychologist will simply go  nope  didn t happen   Admittedly different from your situation  but disturbing nonetheless  Makes me not want to ever get married ,2,1
You live you learn You love you learn You cry you learn You lose you learn You bleed you learn You scream you learn,1,1
Your a good man    I m glad you had the resources to protect your self    Good Luck  ,2,1
Great advice  ,1,2

If she moved back to Japan  she probably didn t enjoy living in the US  Crazy to do all of this  I guess she was trying to save face so she could tell people back home it wasn t her fault  Crazy story  Best of luck ,1,0
Thanks for sharing  Went through something similar in Japan  Japanese women after having a child turn vicious  This happens especially when you are not Japanese  Remember Japanese discriminate by default  and a large majority of them are seriously racist  These are the type of people that will call you a foreigner in your own country  No Joke,7,2
One of the best posts you ve ever done,4,0
thanks techlead   i used to run restaurants in CA   i found out that some lawyers coach mexicans to file lawsuit against owners to claim cash ,41,4
That s unfortunate  Do cameras help ,2,
Thanks for your courage to share   Men need to grow smart about these situations as the system is lopsided for sure for the greater good of a perhaps smaller proportion of situations but are being abused daily by women out there   The more men are aware of how this works  the less we see this injustice play out in the future ,2,1
6 02 this sounds like a situation that happens in anime when the MC is starting to lose it all,26,2
Damn man that really sucks I hope everything gets cleared up  Best wishes  yes family law hates men ,2,1
Damn  If you need to install cameras in the house for your protection from your spouse  you got the wrong spouse ,3,7
Protip  they can all turn into the wrong spouse at any moment  You think anyone gets married thinking their partner is this kind of person ,4,
Ok  first of all   I hear and feel you bro   but I am having trouble connecting the sequence of events here    First  why would you even take your wife s phone to start with    And it s not in a playful way  just because she took your pen   plus this is the time you are trying to make it up with your ex     And when you were in the jail  your dad does not have   to bail you out  so you have to spend few thousands with bail firm   your dad doesn t have few k on the credit card   While you are millionaire    You are not helping out your dad at all   And why do you not right a way hire a creditable lawyer to protecting your rights  I am assuming you should have access to lawyers from your earlier divorce and also from your business  as this will be registered on your record if you don t fight it   Sorry  didn t meant to questioning you  but     As someone had told me before  there are always 3 versions of stories  his  her and the truth ,1,1
You re living a tough life man  My girlfriend won t even bother me to take out the trash ,8,0
Damn dude  I m second guessing getting married now ,1,0
This mans got a real Auntie Helen,2,1
fighting over a pen    and why would you take her phone man    you make 500thousand dollars just buy a new pen,1,1

Japan is a country with sole custody  not joint custody  so the parent who takes the child without permission from their spouse can get custody and claim marital expenses from the spouse  For this reason  there are many unscrupulous lawyers who advise wives who want to get divorced to make up a story about domestic violence even if their spouse did not do it  If you search for  divorce  in Japanese  you will find sites that encourage you to make up a DV story  This is becoming a problem in Japan as well  and your wife may have searched for  how to divorce  in Japanese So many Japanese wives are taking away their kids because of sole custody ,2,1

 Chen Fa The incel and  I haven t actually interacted with women  energy yall give off scares me,1,
 SomeoneOnlyWeKnow Hmm  Just to let you know I have nothing against women gender itself  lol  Negative people exist in both genders  And thankfully vindictive and hateful women do not represent all women out there in the entire world  of course  Women who are mature and caring  and do not try to make men responsible for all of the negative emotions and suffering they feel within themselves  are also universal across all countries and cultures  Those are the positive types that men would really be blessed to have as wives  I ve been with both types before  The negative kinds are basically a psychological mess within themselves  that can only feel safe and secure when they can dominate  control  or else put down men   Likewise for the negative kind of men  ,1,

 Alan   I too   liked Japanese and thought they are kind and nice  So when I was hiring a nanny   I was excited to find an agency that deals with Japanese nannies  However  after 2 bad experiences I find that Japanese just wants to be perceived to be good due to their social and professional hierarchy system  What they actually do behind close door could be different  So only people who are closest to them would know their nature    I had 2 Japanese nannies  both quit with one or 2 days notice when we agreed to 2 4 weeks notice   I had Europeans  Aussie and Chinese nannies  when it is time for them to leave  they give plenty of notice so we have enough time to find another person to look after the kids  Some even come back to work again when they come back from overseas trip    So  after these 2 experiences  I have lost faith in these Japanese girls  On the other hand  I still keep in touch with many of the nannies who used to look after my kids  It s so weird that many of my nannies said it was great looking after our family  some come back and work  some recommended their friends  but these Japanese girls had a bad time   ,1,
Indeed  I ll go as far to say that the justice system in man vs woman is stacked against us  Thread carefully ,2,
 idiot321321321 Yes  she did some time in jail  Again  if I weren t so on point in my handling of everything that she tried to stick me with  the outcome would have been VERY different  Also  I was lucky  in that  I had a VERY conservative female judge that saw through her bullshit  I couldn t have asked for a better situation  But  I am part of several groups such as  Fathers for Equal Rights  where those guys weren t lucky enough to have gotten the same treatment  Family Court is totally broken  I ve often thought of running for Congress with Family Court reform being my primary platform ,1,

 Sara christine EXTREMELY RARE   I am a single father that has been raising my son alone since he was 2    he s now 17  Getting full custody in the broken and corrupt family court system in America was a miracle  His mother  no doubt coached by her feminist lawyer  tried all the usual tactics to try to damn me  Tried to get me for domestic violence  but I was recording her  so she was arrested instead  Tried to claim that I was sexually abusing my son    that one REALLY broke my heart  I immediately took him to get physically  mentally and emotionally tested by medical psychological professionals  My son s doctor ended up testifying against his mother on my behalf  His mother tried every avenue to get my money  but it all ended up backfiring on her  If I hadn t been so meticulous  and calculated  there is no doubt I would have ended up broke  without any visitation  let alone custody of my son  nor would have have been able to keep my reputation intact  So  Christine  you are one of the anomalies  It does give me hope that not all women are evil  But  sadly  the majority of your sex  at least in western countries  tend to fit the stereotype ,13,

Um  I am a modern day American woman and I just divorced my husband who has worked his whole adult life for a decent amount of assets that I just left alone  I walked away with nothing but my own debt because if I told someone I loved them once  it means something about how I will treat them forever  I am sad we didn t work out  but I wish him well  And his stuff is not my stuff ,41,

I keep trying to warn American men who make good money to not get married in this country   Once you sign those papers the women has all the power  Women in America win 90  of divorce settlements and they file for divorce at a rate of 80  compared to men  On top of that the divorce rate is at 50   You d have to be an absolute moron to give a women that much power over you  It s not 50 50 equality as everyone likes to preach   it s literally 90 10 in the women s favor  I believe in marriage  but the current court system completely fucks over men  Its not worth it ,1,1

Definitely related to this  I installed cameras in my home and started recording conversations where she would try to provoke me to have an altercation with her or talk negatively about me in front of our child  Taking these sad steps have actually helped me more in the long run,105,6
These days even casual female acquaintances co workers  can ruin you with a complaint to HR along with the new catchphrase  I don t feel safe   It starts a mandatory investigation that will only end one way unless you can somehow disprove her statement  I know someone who works in a large office takes up one floor of a building  and he records audio or video any time he s alone with a female like an elevator  the break room  walking out to his car  etc  Hit record and slip the phone into a pocket facing out or just hold it inconspicuously even if it s upside down  The idea is to record evidence of nothing happening during that encounter  If she makes something up it will be one of those times with no witnesses  If you re in a  two party state  that doesn t allow you to record another person secretly just say you found it on your phone and had no idea it was on  At the very least you can show it privately to the right people to secure their bias ,5,

As I ve told you before  I too was married to a Japanese woman for 4 years  She too was brutal and took my daughter back japan  I tried everything to reconcile everything  She was simply pissed I didn t let her burn all my money  I never bought her name brand bags  I was forced to sign the divorce papers in japan and lose custody of my child  I ve never heard from  or seen my daughter in 13 years  All I can say is accept it  let go  let go of any guilt about your child because you didn t choose it  and she will poison the kid against you anyway  Accept your situation  and work toward a happy life  You cannot control the universe ,1,2

 SomeoneOnlyWeKnow lol what is your point ,2,
 NoNameChannel And what is your point  Like  so what ,1,
 SomeoneOnlyWeKnow you completely misunderstood the example  The purpose was to state some people compare edge cases  which is pointless  Yes SOME people have great relationships with women  and SOME people have terrible relationships with family  But on AVERAGE the family bond is strong and good  and the marriage bond is weak and terrible  these days  ,10,
 Kent Peterson money talks you can have a better relationship with a woman than you do your family  for sure if your family is disfunctional   Don t make the blue pill mistake of trying to find unique examples to counteract a generalization that s true  Obviously if your father molested you and your mother hit you and locked you in the basement as a punishment for making eye contact  then most women you date would be better  family  you could argue  My point is  a typical family has a MUCH better bond than the typical marriage  Hell  the typical marriage is on the brink of divorce basically considering it s a coin toss if the typical family will actually get divorced ,6,
 NoNameChannel Sometimes a woman really  can be a better family then your parents and siblings  I know people in real life where that is the case but of course those people never liked their parents or siblings in the first place ,2,
 Logan Learns X first off  most men that think these things simply avoid marriage or even cohabitation  They just date casual to medium term  and let other men marry the women after they re done with them  But to clarify your point because I m 36 now and don t care to put as much effort into women  the word incel means involuntary  If you chose to stop investing in dating culture  you re celibate  not involuntarily celibate  If you are trying to get sex and can t  then you are incel ,9,
 Lluna Buades Don t worry  I won t ever marry  I trust no one,6,
 Lluna Buades Oh  they re perfectly rational for the goal she had,2,
 NoNameChannel  it s real when we think about it that man violance is physical and what woman do is psychological damage  However  this kind of behavior are that bad  Both obviously,5,
but she wasn t really mad  She was obviously faking it in order to provoke violence from him  It was a planned action and not an actual argument ,9,
 Lluna Buades maybe not all  but way too many  So many that it s not really worth the risk to find out what kind you have on your hands ,15,
Well  better say  his woman  and other ones and not all of us  you know  Her actions are insane and  irrational,15,
Truer words  seldom spoken  But how many young men will listen ,19,
 Vital Chance most men think that a woman they marry becomes family  similar to how your parents and siblings are family  To a woman though  you re always just a stranger that s investing in her  If your usefulness and her enjoyment ends  so does the relationship  You re not family in her mind ,78,

Hey incel domestic violence is a real thing believe it or not  Just because you ve had a bad experience  which we re all taking your word for  doesn t mean domestic violence related restraining orders are  trivial  and that we should be dismissive of women or men who claim to have been domestically abused,2,3

Marriage is an IQ test ,3,
The only caution you need to take is to never do it  Techlead is being foolish recommending only a prenup  Prenups get contested and thrown out  or litigated til the guy gives up  so often that it s not worth it  It doesn t stop these false claims of domestic violence either  He says the will be less likely to do them if a prenup is in place  but I think that s backwards  If she can show domestic violence  the prenup is even more likely to be thrown out ,8,

I absolutely agree the US court system is fuc ed when it comes to women vs men  Women don t get into trouble when they lie to the police  The cops just ignore it  In this case your wife committed assault and battery  then played the victim  You are so lucky you don t live anywhere near her  She s evil  I ve seen videos where women beat up on men trying to get them to hit them  and in one case a women hit herself in the face repeatedly before calling the police  the guy never touched her  He showed the video to the police   she did not get into trouble  The system is fuc ed ,1,1
