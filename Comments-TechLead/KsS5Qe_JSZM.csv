 DBA is for you  obtain yours ,1,1
I got mad at my credit union and withdrew all  210 000 I had there   All that filthy U S  currency is here at my house and I am getting worried someone might steal it   Can anyone here recommend a financial advisor   I prefer a person who can invest my money in crypto currency   I am not concerned about the fees  as long as I am getting a quality product to HODL for a long time  unless the advisor thinks it best to trade them all the time to maximize profits    Thank you ,1,1
DBA will be huge  grap some now,1,1

I started watching your videos earlier last year as a beginner before giving stocks a trial and I ve been able to scale from  120K to  580K  I did get an advisor for supervision and accountability as you recommended Thanks ,20,10
 Chris Millson It s incredible to come across Ann related comments on  Just a small note of gratitude to her  I was down  down  and downer before I started working with her  After reaching her online website on the web  I have already increased my little portfolio last year with her platform  Currently at  163k Q1 2022 Crypto users could top 1B by 2023 as nations continue to adopt Bitcoin  Buy the dip  and HODL for the long term  Bitcoin ALWAYS comes back ,3,
 Chris Millson she really seem to know her stuff  saw her educational background and qualifications on her website  thanks for sharing ,1,
 Ivy Theodore The advisor I use is Nicole Ann Sabin  she s quite known  so you could just search her ,5,
 Chris Millson nice one man  more info on this advisor please ,1,
 Ivy Theodore well about 50  of my portfolio profit was from TSLA  GME and NIO  my FA was able to get me in early on most of these stocks and I exited just at the right time  her analysis was really on point ,2,
Interesting   how did you pull this off mate ,1,
Predicting  a reversal of a trend is risky  and even worse  I believe there is more to this market than we understand currently  When people are losing  they don t aim to increase their average  but that can only change if you have a personal trade guide and signal provider like that of  Anika Hobson which has made me almost 9 5 on a 2 btc Trade capital over the last 3 months  Make the wise decision  Markets fluctuate in cycles that can last anywhere from a few days to several years  In the case of B  TC  it s difficult to make a bullish case simply from looking at the charts ,51,7

 If you are poor  stop being poor  I cannot stop binge watching all your sarcastic remarks in this space  I just made a decision this morning to stop wasting time negotiating with my company for that meagre raise and promotion and instead focus on building my skills and hustling outside of my 9 5 job  You cannot imagine how these tips are confirming all my plans and thoughts surrounding career and wealth growth  Thanks Techlead  Avid supporter here ,4,1

Best thing to do seems to just go somewhere you don t have to pay taxes  It seems like being stolen from by the mafia organization that is the Government leads to people being poor and taking longer to retire than anything else ,1,3
TechLead you re making the difference in my life  Thank you for the millions that you re just helping me to be more capable to have  and this is costing me only a fell views   minutes listening to The techlead    What a great way YT is to share free value and receiving it back  in all the meanings   p s   this isn t sarcasm  I m just gratefull  tutoring me for free  ,6,1
You want a million fast  get Million Token  now ,1,1
You are right about it all  Love hearing you speak about the truth ,1,1
Luckily i don t need nowhere near 1 million dollars to achieve financial freedom and that s mainly because i refuse to be a slave to material things ,2,1
 Data science is entry level  Techlead,3,1
The problem I had with the potential promotion of 10 15  is that if you are on a team of people of say 10 people  you have a 10  chance of getting that promotion   Yet  if the company can psych everyone into working harder  they can squeeze 110  out of those 10 people and only have to give a promotion to 1  It doesn t make sense to work harder ,6,2
i love the life advices you give  despite using sarcasm wich i consider very funny  all the things you say are just the purest truths of life  i love your stoicism  psychology and philosophical point of view of life  greetings from mexico big brother wich i never had  Pd  i want to recomend you a book  it is called the four agremments  thats the book that changed my perspective of life ,4,1

 I m new to crypto trading what s the best way to get started with trade cos l ve been making my personal research for a while now I don t know how to trade on crypto trading  ,1,1
TechLead is absolutely right  Most employers might offer you that promotion after many years of you  proving yourself   i e   doing lots of extra work for free   but it s usually a 15  or so increase for about 50  more work or responsibilities  Heck of a deal  right  All things considered  it s better to do the minimum for as long as possible  guard your time and spend that most valuable resource as you prefer   They will promote you if and when they like and you can also turn it down and leave if YOU like  Take charge  people  Oh  and ah  don t get married or have kids  if possible  Employers are counting on those balls and chains to keep you a slave ,40,2
It s funny as I read this because I m up for a promotion myself  and these are exactly the thoughts I m having  I may transfer or I may leave if I don t like the new role ,1,
This helped me  a lot  ,1,1

Awesome information  Love how he keep mentioning that taxes are gonna take half of your big money  People forget the more money you make the more Uncle Sam is happy lol,2,1
When the markets like this  it s your patience that gets tested more than your trading skills  Most of us get in to crypto for the fast   volatile markets but the ones who can sit on their hands   stick to the plan for months on end are the ones who will make life changing money ,9,4
 jessica moore  Just found his official website I ll get in touch  Thank you ,1,
I d say invest in good projects and DYOR if you don t understand  Dollar cost average instead of going all in at once  so as to give you a good value for your money  Also I d recommend seeking a proven fiduciary Financial Advisor who will guide  and show you the ropes as you are just starting out  I mean the likes of  alexis Georgeanna Herman  just like i did ,3,
There is ALWAYS a way to make money in this market  While the market has not been set to easy mode recently  there are still nft to flip  solid coins to stake  IDOs to ape into  trades to make  yields to farm  Never stop hustling for those gains,3,

I own a business  I am a contractor specializing in turns and renovation work for dilapidated homes and structures  I have been in business for almost 10 years  I have been exposed to the hazards from materials  managers and owners  This business is fueled by raw grit and determination to see it through  I am 37 and ready to start something else other than being the muscle and business face  I admit that I am finally coming to terms with the fact that I need to do more than trade my health for meager wealth  Time is our most precious commodity  we are all capable of doing great things if we put our mind to it  I wish you the best of luck  yeah you  And thanks to THE Techlead for offering something of value for us to ruminate,14,3
