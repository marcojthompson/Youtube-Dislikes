You need to beg ur wife back   Women are the glue that holds a man together brother  ,1,
 James Bell  Exactly    dry humor     why do all these people insist on putting him down as if he were being serious       Curmudgeon maybe  ,2,
 Opal Tometi BLM CEO oh yeah true true   ,1,
 James Bell whatever floats his boat    btw steve jobs and elon musk doesn t penny pinch    they spend like no tomorrow   ,2,
 Opal Tometi BLM CEO I get his sense of humour  He is quite dry and witty  He is not actually comparing himself it s called dry humour I think,2,
 James Bell if your not a multimillionaire like tech lead then your a nobody     he s comparing himself to bill gates and steve jobs    can you do that ,3,
 andythom  If he were a woman you d be defending her    a true white knight ,1,
 MANxVSxMACHINE I watched his other video  He didn t want to spend money on buying a house for himself and his wife and decided to live with his parents  That financial decision cost him his marriage and relationship with his child  So  when I see him making videos about financial management and investing I cringe as his frugal decision making cost him more than any stock market crash could  He was so stingy with his money he could not see his ex wife did not get along with his parents  he has saving few dollars and this in turn caused his wife to leave with his kid  He makes Warren Buffet look like an amateur ,3,
Maybe your sibling asked you to make way for other hikers because he she wanted to protect you  Over protection  Your wife sounds nuts  But you ve got a kid  So you know she ain t nuts  you re both bitter  But get over it and at least you ll be a peaceful place for your kid to come visit  Bitterness is overcome at different rates  I like this video  Just my two cents worth  I m probably wrong  ,1,
 Opal Tometi BLM CEO well if we think about it society ruined that as she would never had been in the position if american dating norms were pushed first instead of marriage as they seemed to not grow apart but never be properly together to begin with,1,
you did ruin her life    she could still be on the market making money from customers    now shes stuck with your baby making no money   and begging you to give her some money so she can afford to raise your kid    lol,1,
 andythom The person that thinks they are the smartest person in the room  is typically not   Techlead is one of the finest edutainers and what you are seeing is a persona   He knows that relationships are not one sided ,2,
Hmmm   I don t see you as a villain   I find you entertaining and educational    Some insight on combat training from a veteran  disabled veteran  that is a huge supporter and subscriber of yours   Combat training isn t meant to create a sunk cost fallacy where soldiers are ready to enter combat   From experience  there is some truth that through instructional design you develop habit to shoot at a pop up target  that makes it much easier to pull the trigger  accurately  at a person and not think too hard that you are pulling the trigger at a person   That may have come out wrong and I don t think anyone should think lightly when pulling a trigger whether they are at the range or in combat  but sunk cost fallacy should be applied to economics and not combat training for novice soldiers ,1,
TechLead  have you  as an ex Google ex Facebook multimillionaire  considered including your siblings or parents in a video ,2,
I love the intro   if your life is messed up  it s your fault   Listen people  Extreme responsibility is what will take you out of the gutter ,9,
 Everyday Person Watch his previous videos  he has very clearly spelled out his mistakes   taken accountability  Documenting this experience provides a valuable lesson in how to avoid failing a relationship  It also highlights the problems we face in western society such as    entitlement ,8,
She left  It s not your fault man  You re allowed to voice your feelings  Don t let her hurt you ,5,
Hmmm  so by you treating your ex wife so well by you and your family providing her with all the material resources and emotional support she decided to leave with your child for an uncertain future  Well  makes perfect sense to me  By treating her well  is it the same as you are treating her now  By tarnishing her reputation by making these assertions and delivering your monologue on this platform when she does not a right of reply  Again  I have not completed a computer science degree so I might be daft to the situation  but I have not heard one negative word from you describing your actions that may have contributed to the dissolvement of your marriage  Maybe you are like the rest of the divorcees who seem to never be in the wrong  Rich  educated  experienced and worldly but ex wife left with his child to another continent  hmmmm  yep  never wrong ,6,
It s not your  millions  that make you toxic   it s your mindset and attitude towards others   Do you know what Barrier To Entry is   I ll wait ,3,
Is competitive programming imp for faang,2,
I disagree  a single person can ruin someone s life  and if u dont believe me  well let s give some examples  John Lennon an obsessed  fan    Successful men where their ex wife take their money through the court system  just a few and there are alot more of 1 person ruining lives  Becareful who blet in ur circle ,1,2

I like this guy   is so honest but lack basic emphaty  you just need to have other arrogant friends dude I can be one lol   or maybe you can try to master yet another skill   how your brain function about feelings and emotion by learning yet another programing skill   neuro linguist programing  NLP  which in fact is not a computer programming but brain programing with words   they will teach you how brain uses mate programming but not being specific but generalist    just take a mentor like Richard bandler,1,1

techlead   you cant blame anyone of ruining your life   also techlead   my wife ruined my marriage   i feel like these are the closure videos almost directed to her,16,1
I m surprised that you  TechLead  as a millionaire  have so little control over your emotions  SAD ,1,1
I hope he finds a new love,1,0
 i m a very easy person to hate   ,1,0
I totally agree with you that we can t victimise ourselves  Every relationship has something to teach us for our growth  Yet I think here we can use empathy to approach the issue  A divorced woman with a child has a significantly lower market value indeed  while a rich old man  not you  can still feel confident to meet more people  Your ex probably needs some courage to face the reality that she s divorced and has to be independent to face the future that she fears about  Her accusation to you shows that she is a weak person lacking confidence and strength to move on fully  So Empathy is better than logic ,10,0
My ex wife cheated on me got pregnant from another guy during my marriage  I divorced her and  have become a multimillionaire since  I can tell you this is the ultimate revenge method that burns her everyday on earth  Until she burns in hell of course ,1,1
I ll tell you why your wife was treating strangers better than you your family  Because she knows you well enough that she can be her true self  while she has to keep up the  nice  image when dealing with strangers   ,4,0
Hmmm the way this video starts off  if this is how you talked to her then I can see why she thinks that   lol,2,0
lol talk about petty  maybe your wife left cause she got sick of talking to a robot  maybe she made a human error that Techleads couldn t forgive but she probably found someone else that has a heart ,15,0
This is way too much BS for my recommendations  Such a waste  Unsubbing right now ,7,0

I don t think it s smart to always be at higher level than other people  There is smartness in going down sometimes  It expands the vision of reality  If you go traveling and limit your budget to  say  200 per day  you may have a very exciting time  but it will be different from you normal Hawaii trip,1,0

I think that it is important to know the heart of your now ex wife   You seem to be good at using your brain and are apparently monetarily successful   Marriage is more about knowing how to be there for your spouse on all levels especially emotionally   It isn t just about the money ,1,0

Ur wife is lucky,1,2
In my opinion  People tend to  hate  each other because they only see superficial things and don t bother understanding what lies underneath   Edit  Or  in your case  what it cost to get where you are ,1,1
You re just too logical and practical for most modern people  Don t take it too personal  Most people today are pretty much emotional overgrown babies  it s all about feelings and image  People don t really appreciate quality and wisdom  The people that are  cool  are the ones that are flashy  loud  rude  obnoxious  Being aware of truth is a lonely road ,3,1
I feel like your ex wife just got too comfortable around you,1,1
I would love to have a one to one conversation with this man,3,0
     and probably the reality is you re incredibly self entitled and think the world owes you things for you having done nothing to deserve it       SHOTS FIRED   ,2,1

You are a really smart man  Why did you get married in the first place  Did you have a prenup  Anyway I learned a lot from stories like yours  stay strong  Mr  Tech Lead ,2,0
you re soo my type  please ruin my life too ,2,1
Man  this is so true in my life right now  going through a divorce and my  still current  wife saying I ruined her life  all this and that  when I was just trying to live my life and she s the one that would actively seek out to destroy it   I read that if people get offended or threaten by a simple statement it s their own insecurities coming out  and I have seen jealousy in that form  where you share your success and someone instead of being happy  they get jealous  instead of celebrating or being happy  or even better  asking for advice  That s what I would do  if I meet someone more successful  I would try to learn as much from them as possible  rather than hate on them  that really doesn t help anyone at all ,22,1

Unless you re being totally sarcastic and don t really mean to say what you re saying  I can t agree with anything I heard here  Of course  a person can ruin the life of their spouse because marriage means the two become one  Which means there is dependence on each other  and of course control over each other s life  future  all sort of decisions like where to live  how much to spend  how many kids to have  how to raise them etc and much more  And wiring money to your spouse and making it seem like you re doing her or him a favor is not the way to be the good spouse  And it does not mean that you care about her   This is just one small part of it  Being a good spouse is loving them  caring for them  providing for them  sharing everything material and non material with them  spending quality time with them  doing things they love  showing them honesty  transparency in everything  loyalty  respect  forgiveness  showing how much you re grateful to have them  showing them they re your number 1 priority in life  always showing them nothing else matters as much as they are  staying with them through thick and thin  being nice and kind to their friends and relatives  supporting your spouse in every way  not only financially but also emotionally  morally  spiritually  and practically  helping them not only financially but by sharing all household duties  child care duties  cooking  cleaning  mowing the lawn etc     If you can not do this PLEASE DON T GET MARRIED  GET ONLY A FRIEND WITH BENEFITS  Don t ruin someone s life    ,1,0
I do agree  You are easy to hate,2,0

The way he talks is like about the fox  who could not get the grapes from the tree after multiple tries  so it walked away by saying that the GRAPES ARE SOUR  I think the main problem is his bad personality for getting divorced And he is just not ready to admit tge fact,22,2
You can smell the sarcasm  Every quality about himself that he said was probably what his wife accused him of being ,2,
do you really think its his real personality ,2,
I think you hate your self and you project that to others I don t think that everyone hate you ,3,0
The ad transistion was seem less,1,0
Money alone doesn t make you successful   you assume money can one up everything but success is a combination of factors  one of them is a family which you clearly didn t succeed  You are not a  final boss   just a lonely man venting  And i can see why people would think you are arrogant   you seem to not be able to hold a convo without involving money ,1,0
     you know what the real problem is     most people only think they are successful until they finally meet me   ,28,0
Appreciate the honesty   arrogance   however I believe it would be very interesting and same time very annoying to hang around with you ,1,0
This guy is on the way to having a million sub being sarcastic  ,1,0
I like a lot of your points  maybe you re speaking hypothetically  but you seem as fixated on yourself as other people who are fixated on you  in fact  your perception of yourself as a  final boss  or someone else s  hell  is only true in your own conception of what a final boss or someone else s hell is  it s sorta off putting how much thought you re putting one upping people in conversations  etc   a constant  nagging  and uncontrollable internal desire to one up people is my version of hell   I just think you need to let it flow  get out of your own head  and maybe go to Jamaica  smoke a blunt or two  find yourself a new lady  and chill at a beach bar with some locals  I like your videos a lot  but this one turned me off my guy   ,1,1
TL has lost it   He s created this imaginary world where he s the hero and everyone wants to be him or take him down   What a joke   No one cares except the incels who cheer him on ,4,0
For anybody reading this  Know the meaning of what success is like to you  Success is different for everyone   I ve seen families that only had enough for their necessities  but are the happiest people and you can feel the families closeness  I ve seen rich families  but their kids are all messed up  I m sure the best are probably rich  close and loving family  The last example is probably I m gonna be jealous of lmao,5,0
This video alone shows clearly why you may have been in the wrong in your marriage  People influence other people  Your way of thinking is faulty and very narrow minded  You need to take a close look at yourself,5,0
Techlead is independently successful and satisfied with his life so he is happy for other people s success and literally does not understand jealousy  envy  resentment  Sadly I ve found these negative emotions drive a huge amount of people s day to day interactions thoughts and feelings  it s really sad ,25,3
I believe you and I are the same with him because otherwise people don t even believe that a human could  not  understand envy  I don t even feel like he s using sarcasm  Why do you envy instead of being happy for them  Well  I guess it s about being satisfied with your life ,1,
I learned a new term today   Final Boss Syndrome  Lmaooooo,104,0
Love it  So funny  She must be outraged  ,4,1
TechLead is incomprehensibly intelligent and financially successful  but his general disposition is very off putting  Maybe he has a great mind   like Bill Gates  Steve Jobs  Jeff Bezos  Elon Musk  but the arrogance and narcissism are too much for many people to digest  In other words  people don t just marry for money  Money is not an ingredient for genuine friendship and long lasting love ,3,0
We are like his therapist  so this mess his ex wife left can be sorted out  as a millionaire  ,2,0

 Nicholas Weng Fancy birthday parties with sushi and wine are planned months in advance  You would have to be a millionaire to know this ,3,
 Nicholas Weng He was just kidding  if you haven t noticed that yet about his videos ,15,
LMFAO     Brilliant    ,5,
This video got me to subscribe     Your ex wife was jealous of your family  and perhaps of your upbringing  and felt she was entitled to it  When it wasnt given freely   she attacks ,1,0
you understand   he ruined it  as a millionaire of course ,1,0
this guy is on another level  as a millionaire,1,0

Who got custody of the kids  TechLead,2,0
Hey I am a little confused    Is this guy a millionaire ,2,0
 Like he invited me last weekend  lmao,14,0
Hm marrying a woman then failing her and letting her alone to grow a child  single mother with min8mal chances to rebuild a family or a life  True millionaire you are right ,2,1
maybe people are really mad about him as if he s so selfish or whatever  but this genius hypes me asf for my life for being a succesfull person  thanks man ,1,0
He s secretly hoping his wife gets back  He s low key begging her to come back ,21,4
Then  he is using the wrong approach  which will render her even more resentful ,2,
I don t think you would publicly criticize your wife  air your dirty laundry  and complain about your marriage if he wanted her back lol  I think he fairly effectively shreds her character and it s hard to think someone like the TL  at least from what I can gather from watching his videos  would respect his wife enough to want to be in a relationship with her again ,1,
 elenabob I have actually said this to someone when I was in victim mentality mode  I did really believe that person actually ruined my life then  They took away many formative years from me and I had to deal with the repercussions growing up  To be specific so people don t think I just threw that phrase around  this person molested me since I was 5 years old  I had to realize the hard way that no one can really ruin your life if you don t let them  Yes bad things can happen and people can do terrible things but we have to move on and try not to be a victim  It s easier said than done however ,1,
Nah  he s just venting and I can see how one could be hurt by such a remark when it comes from someone close to you  In my case  my bigger sister really know his to push my buttons ,7,

Correct me if I m wrong but your entire message in every video is pretty much  dont mind everything else and focus on yourself ,1,0
Dude   You re twisting the situation around to place the blame on someone else   A spouse can destroy someone s life   If u don t know that  ur blind   People like u are oblivious to how much harm you can cause   If it makes u feel better believing what u say  ur a fool,6,1

Rationalising failed transaction normal people call  a relationship   The good thing about the fact that you have a YouTube channel is that any future potential mate could reference this before making the mistake of becoming enmeshed with a person displaying NPD traits ,1,0
It s hard to figure out how serious this is  but anyhow I think a big reason they hate you is that you are no longer a Facebook or Google tech lead and now just live in your parents  basement yet still constantly brag about your achievements  There are tons of millionaires out there these days and most of them are way more successful in life than you are  no offense  They also are generally nicer people ,1,0
Hmmm  this video was published on April 1   ,1,0

This is an obvious shitpost but a good one ,1,0
TechLead isn t a bad person  he s just very focused on his feelings and his life views he disregards other people s perspectives     It s not a terrible thing to be selfish  He s really good at protecting himself    He doesn t think about  why his wife may feel certain emotions  nor does he consider what other people may be going through  he doesn t even understand why he should be considerate and let other people cross on hikes  5 30   he just seems very self centered    But congrats  you re a millionaire    I think TechLead serves as a great reminder that we should not push ourselves to the extremities of any place  although money is great  it s not worth it if you don t have people to share it with ,10,0
Hahaha  I really like you dude  your arrogance as well  Reminds me of myself  I am the one you were always afraid to meet though    Not gonna say more cause I don t want your world to come tumbling down    P Keep up the good work ,1,0

Haven t watched this man child for a while   I see he s still wallowing in the passive aggressive narcissism that I remembered   Nice to see some old traditions still endure  anyway     ,5,1
call him what you will he s probably a lot smarter than you  and that  s kind of the point of his channel how to use your brain to get ahead  If you re not into that there s other channels out there for  you   Let me guess you re gona respond with I just watch to hate right   Just goes to show how much smarter I am than you  as I should be being that I m a millionaire ,1,
Sooooo Poetic    ,1,0
Its funny how confused these comments seem    People just really dont understand how success happens or how really smart people think ,1,0
Should have seen this when i was a kid  I was too good at sports  had good skin and nice hair  but bad at socializing  After a while most of my classmates hated me  I realized i was a final boss and i didnt really want to change it  I wanted my classmates to grow up to me but they failed and i failed as well  My failure was not knowing enough  their failure was not being able to grow ,2,0
perhaps your sibling was being courteous to oncoming traffic and you re a slow hiker  lmao,2,0
People decide that their lives have been ruined way too easily  Didn t get into company school whatever they wanted  Life ruined  Failed relationship  Life ruined  Et cetera ,9,1
Failed marriage is definitely a life ruined  Because you get married expecting to be together forever  My best friend almost died after her husband dumped her for no fault of hers    She was weighing only 48 kilos at one point  not eating  not sleeping  not wanting to live  Broken heart is just as hurtful as physical pain trust me   And when it s caused by someone you thought was literally another half of your body and soul  that s a trillion times more painful ,2,
TechLead is a flawless clean white gem,1,0
lmao i love how he can easily switch between his techinterviewpro and his rant about his ex wife  That s millionaire mindset right there ,2,0

Bro   I ll grant U this    the combination of ur satire  sarcasm    humor  are unique,1,0
 Even though the farmer has more criminal acts than me    ,11,0
I think people hate each other because people are inherently selfish   want to do what s best for themselves first  Sometimes this will get in the way of someone else s goal to do what s best for them   will think of that other person as an obstacle to overcome ,1,0

I really needed TechLead today    he is hysterical  xo,3,0
I love your videos  they  make me so happy ,1,0
Dude  your pride is consuming you and you re hurt inside   ,9,0
Have you tried therapy  I feel like narcissistic personality disorder might be a thing you should mention to your therapist ,1,0
damn u needed to vent didnt you,2,0
 They think they are smart until they meet me  Techlead,2,0
In all seriousness  is TechLead on the spectrum  Like  I can t imagine being married to a less empathetic human being  I get it that he thinks he and his family paid for everything  but what about spending time and interacting with loved ones  I feel like under the surface he s really insecure  still   Edit  I ask if he s on the spectrum because that would clarify some of his mannerisms  explanations  and behavior  Being on the spectrum isn t a bad thing  it just explains things ,3,2

I wonder what you son will feel like when he grows up and watch all those videos that you publicly criticize his own mom    We never know her side of the story ,75,14
 Carpe Diem how is it falsely  Because he said so ,3,
 Z NIGHTMARE lol  idk  who cares ,1,
 Jovial what s the name of her youtube channel,1,
 Jovial fair point  Especially after I just watched his recent video on how his wife tried to have him falsely accused for domestic violence  Still feel sorry for his son who did not ask to be born into this but has  People need to be more wise about who they have children with  both men and women ,2,
Yes I agree  if they had no children I think it would feel more fair game  I wonder if she ever thinks of suing him for public defamation or something ,3,
Agree  If this guy loves his son as much as he claims he shouldn t try to insinuate to the son through these videos that his own mother  kidnapped  him ,11,
you can know her side of the story by watching her youtube video s  And for the son s feelings  its upto the son  You dont becomes a millionaire  by making every single person feel good  LOL,10,

All Men out there don t you ever forget  It s all your fault  ,1,0
Obviously you are right techlead  as you re a millionaire   and you re making good points  but making a video that s essentially about how you re right and your wife is wrong is not going to make YOU a better person  On the contrary  trying to prove to your followers you have a moral highground goes to show that you re not the right person to give moral advice  You re merely reinforcing and digging in to your own story  Growing up emotionally is hard  especially for programmers like ourselves  haha   But role models like you have an obligation to grow up faster and inspire others  Love ya ,1,0
You re hilarious   this put me in a really good mood,1,1
the  as a millionaire   part of the title gets me all the time ,22,0
The only reason your ex say you  ruined  her life  is because she fantasize that she could have spent that time with someone who would give her even more money ,7,0
Because you are a SIMP  Don t do this mistake ever again  Jesus  lift some weights too and be more manly ,1,0
how did you end up talking about this    ,1,0
I can t tell if this is sarcasm or not but in this case that it s not  I ll say this      Your behaviour  telling all and then some about what happened or didn t happen between you and your wife to your large fanbase  just goes to show that she is better off without you   She can t defend herself so we are left to listen to your side of the story  the least you can do is to stop using her as content and actually create something original   This tactic is getting old and your audience will catch on soon  so you should start creating useful content instead of using your wife Google Facebook to make sub par videos   PS  When you re in a committed relationship with another person and compromise on your personal needs for an extended period of time only to realize it was all for nothing  you can end up affecting each other negatively ie  ruin each other s lives ,1,0
 The dog s just been existing  It doesn t even pay attention to you  It s just living out its own life   You know  I THINK I ve worked out what you did wrong     Don t know if you are attempting to fix that lack of attention somehow by making multiple videos about your ex wife     But  given you have a child together  complaining about her publicly on the internet MIGHT not be conducive to the happiest home environment for your son  Whether it s right or wrong  making your ex wife even angrier at you  will not make things easier when it comes to custody  visitation and generally being included in key family moments  A funny ish  video that gets thousands of views and makes you a little money can t possibly be worth the negative fallout  ,2,0
what I love about your videos is that not only are you educated  you are also wise  Making you a rare title that you exe wife will hate  She hates to have to admit that you are smart  She can t out smart you ,1,0
 People think they are smart untill they meet me  That s me as well,26,2
    and then they think they re brilliant ,1,
It s probably not  But if it makes you feel special go for it ,6,
I worked alongside nerds in IT   Believe me majority of male IT nerds are not nice human beings at all   And once they start to make some money their hidden personality traits start to emerge   They have this anger and tendency to go on some sort of trips of revenge and punishment of whole world for tine little things that would not bother most of us   Totally insecure  constantly competing on every trivia things demanding to be agreed with   not flexible at all  you submit or war   nothing in between  Have a huge ago   prone to have uncontrollable power trips with those that ate somewhat dependant on them but can never stand up for themselves verbally   mentally or physically outside of their comfort bubble  Just listening to this guy ranting   On and one and one rehashing same thing over and over   probably having a great kick and patting himself on the back for his  smart    waffle   If you are rich   get a lawyer and deal with your wife    She is out of his control and he is throwing hissy fit every month for last year or so ,1,0
In a psych class I once asked why we were spending so much time on peoples weaknesses rather than showcasing strengths  It was not a popular point  Glad to see others have thought this way ,43,6

If you took a psych class and this guy isn t one huge red flag then you didn t learn anything,2,
Psychology is becoming more political  And the political makes people miserable ,1,
 K3th  B W That s not good for business  Same reason why medicine that cures instead of treating symptoms is more expensive to produce in the long term  You can t rationally invest in that  It s seriously difficult to survive as someone who fixes other people s problems  permanently  I m not trying to being ironic or cute about this  Market pressures alone are enough to select for professionals that engage band aid solutions over those who prefer to fix problems for good  I m not suggesting of course this an ideal mode of existence to aim for  But it s worth noting that this was the inevitable conclusion to never ending increased market pressure on psychiatric facilities to make quotas  Where ever it is in the world where the self induced victim status fails  it isn t in the therapists  offices   So they train their patients to think that way  then send them out in the world to find out the flaw in that attitude  anywhere else but where they learned it  And they keep coming back for more lessons in their safe space  until they can t afford to anymore  That s the real lesson     I tried what my therapists told me for decades  and now my life sucks     Yes  Glad to have been of educational merit to you  You re very welcome  Please come back anytime for more     ,5,

It s just my opinion and I might be very wrong  First  his ex was a very attractive  graceful and elegant woman who had many  many suitors   She fell in love with him during her best years  He did mention that she d bought him gifts  cooked meals  using shopping coupons to keep within their budget  So she must have deeply and truly loved him in the early years   When my husband and I were separated  we later reconciled   I said to him  you ruined my life   Because I truly love him and it s too painful to let go  We just had our first baby so I was furious and fearful at the thought of raising my baby alone    I hope all works out harmoniously for him and his ex wife,3,0
True bro  you are such a genius,2,0

Hey Tech Lead  is your wife weaponizing custody of the kid against you  I heard Japanese women in a divorce often do this to an even more insane degree than other places  Like they even brazenly break disobey custody rulings and flee the country   and don t even have any means of supporting the kid   even not wanting the money from the ex husband  Like the whole point is to inflict pain on the husband and use the kid as a pawn weapon  You experiencing this  There s support groups  It happens to Japanese men in Japan too  but it s more effective when it s an international marriage   as Japan s government is reluctant  negligent  even  to get involved recognize any foreign custody ruling   Take care ,1,0

 TechLead   When I see you  I saw what I could ve become but am relieved and glad that I didn t   So no  I am not jealous of you and honestly nobody is   And one last thing  you are lonely not because you are at the top   You are lonely because you  think  you are at the top when you are not and you make yourself out to be because you are not able to appreciate things that are different from you   You dismiss things that you can t do or fail as inferior or frivolous and you automatically elevate what you do well as the epitome of godliness to give yourself this illusion that you are  at the top and therefore lonely    You are lonely because nobody  wants  to be with you not because nobody   can  be with you   The moment you can realize the difference  the moment your life will be better and be truly more successful   You are not successful right now btw as much as you think you are ,1,0
Your sibling wanted you to get out of the way of people who were walking faster than you guys  It was just consideration ,3,0
Completely agree  now I just need to be rich ,1,0
TechLead should have interrupted his ex wife s pity party and explained the child she produced is what ruined her life and she can only blame her own stupid biological urges and lack of critical thinking skills for her ruined life   I think I recall she is Japanese and if so  point out her duty to eliminate herself so that her ruined life doesn t affect others  Otherwise   I do like how TechLead obliquely compared his wife to a dog in the first minute  then a short ad   At 1 35 he happens to name drop just a little bit followed by several minutes of suggestions  that we should envy and hate him   it is too funny ,1,0
Love the videos,1,0
Did u just compared yourself to a dog  But whatever you are saying in the whole video makes sense,1,0
Next time I m going to make my haircut the same as you ,1,0
i feel he needs a beer and a hug i can see the good in him   this guy is a narc  lacks emotional intelligence and doesnt understand women  he sees himself as a god yet he s not even a billionaire  yet he s able to bleed like the rest of us  he has no army  no airforce  no navy at his command like putin or xi jinping yet he somehow sees himself at the top   he admits he spoiled her and then left her spoiled  he then gave a logical explanation even though women s behaviors arent based off logic but predictable emotion female psychology   i agree he ruined her life  i wouldnt want a guy like him to get a daughter of mine  he gave her so much because he doesnt understand LESS is MORE with WOMEN  he himself sees himself as a bad person  he sees success as having more money than OTHERS and not setting a goal and finishing it to the end    i was waiting to the end of the video to see how he concludes things and he did  he said why cant people s downsides be accepted so we can love each other  my answer to that is that humans arent perfect beings we cant expect things to be perfect  throughout history there has always been war  its what makes us human but this guy is more of a computer  id still buy him a beer and hang out with  after a beer things are more out in the open and clear  id teach him how to understand women if a terminator can learn to love maybe this computer can too and maybe he d teach me some computer skills  i see the good in him he just needs to let go of his pride so he can learn to be more emotionally intelligent ,1,0

I remember a Married With Children episode where an angry dentist was working on Al  he was upset because his wife was divorcing him and taking him to the cleaners  The dentist was beside himself because he was being punished for tearing her away from a promising career as a waitress  He ruined her life too  lol ,25,4
 Promising career as a waitress  lmao,1,

The media work very hard to get people to not like each other ,1,0
Ahh  you are using the word   we  would give her money  You and you wife were the we and you are using this as though you and your parents are the couple and have included her in your relationship  I can see that her resentment had nothing to do with money  but that may be something your family takes comfort in having and can offer generously   Wonder if she was resentful of the relationship you had with your parents   She may have felt she was competing for you with your family  Did she ever mention feeling like an outsider or an addition to your family  She didn t feel like you created your own life together  but it was more of a relationship that was an extension of you and your parents  Sorry  can you tell I was a Psychology major     I LOVE HUMAN BEHAVIOR and find it absolutely fascinating ,1,0
Sounds like  Crab bucket mentality   which blew my mind to read about and makes a lot of sense,1,0
Your post s topic reminded me when I was 12 o13    My father left my mother and it sent her on a downward spiral   In the beginning she would cry and say  why did he ruin my life      Even at that age I recall thinking    he didn t ruin your life  you being unhappy is ruining your life    eventually  I tried to tell that to my mother but it took a few years for it to sink into her consciousness ,18,6

People waste their time sorting themselves against others  labeling themselves as superior to someone else in some way    gloating   making others feel bad is of no consequence  When someone is more successful than them  they are only concerned that that person has more status and recognition  All of that focus is outwardly focused  based on how others perceive them  Basically  it s all an endless game  there s no lasting  self sustaining happiness ,1,0

Jealousy is an emotion that all people feel there is positive jealousy or so called sports where you want to be successful as someone  and there is a completely unhealthy one where people are ready to do anything because of jealousy  because jealousy is an emotion that unfortunately we humans feel  question  how does one deal with that  otherwise the emotion that people feel about and everyone is jealous who says it s not lying  it s a one way emotion that certain people feel so deeply that they are ready to do anything  the worst things even to murder        a little psychology       ,1,0
If your ex wife says you ruined her life  then she wasn t where she needed to be in her life before she married you  Also  simply could be revenge words or words to make you feel guilty about something  Either way  her words are misplaced   not worthy of your attention ,1,0
April fools,1,0
For the most part I completely agree with this video  But one time someone told me something that I couldn t help but also agree with that hurt to realize  I chose my ex  so what does that say about me  It was in that moment I picked much more carefully from that day forward  ,5,0
I do not know where you heard that about soldiers  but it is very far from the truth  If anything we have a heightened sense of duty  and the discipline to do what it takes to fulfill the missions  We do not like seeing the strong take advantage of the weak  certain Police Officers have the same behaviors   Your evolution as a channel has been interesting from a behavioral and attitude standpoint  I am fascinated by narcissistic personalities and what makes people tick  There is a dark bitterness just beneath the surface of your personality I hope you find happiness ,1,0
He is using this youtube channel as way to talk to his wife from now on  lol  P,1111,32

Lol,1,
with no friends you have to find a way to talk to someone,2,
this is even more true after his recent video lol ,3,

You are applying logic to answer an irrational  statement  To say someone ruined your life is a power play to cover what they want to do  It is projection  to put you on the defense while she goes on offense ,2,0
Did you guys know that TechLead is a millionaire ,1,0
Dammm   all jokes aside   What you expressed in this video is accurate     thanks,1,0
Everyone thank TechLead for our bi weekly reminder to never get married ,662,23
To me it serves a dual reminder purpose    a reminder to the unfulfilled narcissistic self loathing programmers and junior nobodies in SF to never get married because until they learn to stop hating themselves no marriage will be successful   but also a reminder to the rest of society to stay far far away from the aforementioned underbelly of SF because you are doomed from the start trying to have a relationship with spiteful narcissistic men,1,
 Zuhair S ew incel,1,
 H  C yes  because it s always better to focus on the minority of people who are actually happy in marriage  and build concrete goals on the presumption that you too would feature in that minority notwithstanding the carnage happening daily in family court  sound logic indeed ,1,

 ryan k Very good points and constructive debate you bring to the table ,2,
 Doom Guy of course a channel like this attracts all the incels,11,
No  You can t generalize things as one example as relevant for all  Divorce can be ugly but long lasting marriage can be beautiful  How about focusing on the good things about long lasting marriage and do a pros and cons accountability and compare it with divorce  It ll be more fair for everyone to see both sides of the coin instead of pointing the obvious ,15,
 Danny M there s not really much downside to marriage for females  if you re a woman go hog wild and marry however many times you can  but it s likely to be slim pickings if you don t already have a man ready to marry you by the time you re ready ,10,

 Lechsi Z I know he s hurting  but he wouldn t be if he never had gotten married  Use his pain as a warning  gentlemen ,29,
At the end of the day  you passed on your genes and allowed your ex wife to achieve the ultimate goal of every woman   giving birth  Now  if your wife is happy or sad  doesn t matter  that s not a big deal  when you don t frame life in a self centered way,1,0

LOL  Thanks   I laughed at this and loved it and I think you nailed it   People hate others because of their own pride   I don t care if you were being  tongue in cheek  for April 1st about being arrogant and that people hate you because you are better   that is the point  right  They would rather hate others and tear them down than spend time making themselves and others better   They need to spend less time feeling entitled about what they think others owe them and instead of work hard on themselves ,1,0

 Chui Fong Tam But he was too dishonest  Tech Lead has stated he gave her a lavish lifestyle during the courting phase  He gave her the wrong expectations for the marriage  Is it right for the divorce court to help her steal his hard earned assets and his kids  No  Still  he would have been better off telling her he lived like a poor man from the beginning  Men and women don t even bother to be civil or honest with each other  it s no wonder divorce keeps rising ,7,
She literally divorced her millionaire husband and left her kid without an awesome father  I dont understand how Tech Lead ruined her life  Tech Lead GAVE her everything ,21,
Mostly that types of mothers are the ones who bully their child the most  according to what I heard from people in Quora and reddit,29,
She s definitely not considering the life of the child  ,57,

as a multi millionaire myself    My guess is Techlead ruined her life b c she now has a child in tow and he is not paying alimony or child support  since she ran off with the kid to Japan     so now she is just a single mother in Japan where divorce is a negative mark  and the kid acts as another anchor to her non desirability as a single mom     But hey   she brought it on herself by running away with his kid ,1,0

my friend  when you hiking and IF you are too slow  as a kid  it is nice or trivial to let a faster moving person to go ahead to avoid formation of road blocks     You feel more comfortable when nobody is looking at your butt for hours of hiking    It is like driving and slow car is on the right lane and fast one on the left lane    Your story of your sibling putting you down did not click with me unfortunately   I agree with you  I like you talking about difficult subjects calmly   ,7,1

Sounds a lot like my STBX wife  We ve been separated for a year  she s living with her parents  She sent me a message recently saying I m worse than the devil and destroyed her life  She treated me and my family with complete disrespect and then acted like we re the villains when we ve had enough of her BS    So I guess that s half the equation  Unfortunately I m not a millionaire     yet  Working on it ,11,1
Omg  I have the exact same situation as what you described about  treating strangers better than me and my family  though we devoted and helped her and her family so much   It s ridicules ,10,3

Ex wife home and culture is in Japan  Tech lead home and culture is USA as a Chinese American   I heard you  Had Japanese  relationship before to understand that he married a foreigner and of different culture  so I would think divorce is because of unreconcilable differences  But man up forgive one another and look for someone more compatible ,1,0

 Tracy Coats sounds like both are hurt and can t communicate well to themselves or to others,2,
Or she could just be DEEPLY hurt and is expressing it as  you ruined my life   As a woman  I m more convinced that s the case than she actually feels he ruined her life  Hardened hearts come from people being hurt  Some people find a way to avoid the pain   affairs  work  keeping busy  so they don t have to think about it  She may not have those things in her life to distract her so is ACTUALLY having to deal with the difficulty of the divorce head on  No full time job  boyfriend  life hobbies   If a woman feels compelled to say  ruined my life  than she basically gave up everything she loved for her relationship or her complete life was that relationship    and when that went to hell  she felt she had nothing  despite it sounding like  the millionaire  is still supporting her etc  Ruined my life is just a filler for   until I am no longer overcome with hurt pain and can find things I enjoy having doing in my life   I blame you  Bottom Line  she s hurt  It s ok  she s just not going to tell her ex  YOU REALLY HURT ME and I m still suffering from that hurt ,1,

To answer to your final questions  I feel that people hate each other because people are emotionally attached  And hating has to do with not being able to forgive  Like yeah  everyone is capable of doing things that could piss us off  but it s up to us to decide how we react to such actions  Now you might think about some unspeakable things people could do  and so you ask   how could I forgive something like that  Well  the reason why you cannot forgive is because you were attached to a certain aspect of your reality that now no longer exists  and that lack or gap in your reality is defined as  unforgivable  and so you become a victim of your own circumstances  From a theoretical point of view  I believe that people will  unconditionally  love each other when they won t be attached to anything  and that too might have its limitations ,3,0
I remember this stereotype Taiwanese people have of Japanese people is that they treat strangers or customers like God             and they treat their husbands very coldly  If she grew up surrounded by that stereotype then it s no wonder she acts like that   I m not racist I m a half Japanese  pls don t cancel me ,45,10

 D Ttra  you confused bro  The world has changed p  and fast   He got HIRED at FB and GOOG  and was a lead at that   I don t think you can comprehend how many WELL PAID people around the world would kill to have that on their resume  Again  that is SUPERIOR to having a Harvard STANFORD or MIT degree TODAY    If you are not in the tech fields  you would never understand   This man is asked to interview  he could consult anywhere    Any start up would kill to put him and his credentials on their website  He could teach at 90  of US colleges just with those credentials   He has been where people are paying  60 000 a year for a 4 her college degree dream of going    He then built a 1 million sub yt following with his wit   It is what it is  It s all about FAANG dude ,2,
 D Ttra  actually  Techlead is the stuff    In 2021  being a former software tech lead at Google and Facebook  is  bIGGER than a Harvard and MIT college degree   Now he has used his dry sense of humor to have 1 million yt followers   Techlead is that rare    The WORLD wants to be In Silicon VAlley   He is obviously not Gates or Jobs  but he is not coloring his hair and doing pranks for 1 million followers   Dude is beyond rare ,1,
especially when just 2  minute ago  1 57 he spends a whole 2 minute describing how he is the  final boss  that everybody is just so fixated on defeating because he is young and successful  he considers himself successful because he s a millionaire I don t know how trillionaires are gonna have to consider themselves as LOL    Has it ever occurred to him that the reason why everybody is supposedly  fixated  on destroying him is just because he is just not pleasant to be with   And in reality  he needs to get his head out of the cloud to realize that  just like he doesn t give a s    about others  nobody gives a s    about him   Nobody really wants to spend the time and energy to want to  destroy  him   People just don t care about him and that of course leaves him actually incredibly lonely so he actually wants to provoke others like what he does in majority of his videos  LOL  He s the one who wants to compete with others and defeat others otherwise his life is boring and no fun   Of course he doesn t realize that   Oh well at least he s entertaining   LOL,1,

 redsox fan With you on trump  However  tech progress that Jobs brought was coming regardless  the difference was that had it been led by engineers  it would have elevated users  An example I also like to use against minimalism is music production software  People tend to reach for the easiest tools when doing things but geniuses tend to reach beyond their first instinct of what s easy  and so the more minimalist the software  the more everybody s music starts to sound the same  To elevate people  there s no way around making them constantly learn new vocabulary and guiding them to reach further  This is important human potential even for grandma s phone that she just uses to check email and doesn t care about the  extras  like where files are stored  I use vocabulary here metaphorically  because if we applied the same example to language and gave you 5 letters instead of 26  your limited words will mean everybody speaks the same  we re seeing it by the way with censorship and enforced corporate speak    My rant doesn t mean that software or hardware should be messy  What people should focus on as opposed to minimalism is space  The more space you have to fill in ideas  like the tracks or midi areas of music software   the higher you ll reach to fill it ,1,

nah  i dont buy    you gotta pick the right person    prob is most pple pretend and then it falls apart,2,
 Vaquera Soto lol  Mommy will love you unconditionally and there is only one  farming tools will always be there ,3,
Marriage is the best thing that ever happened,2,
 Riyansh Biswas Between blaming him for everything and  kidnapping their child  I think it s safe to say wifey was rotten to the core  Sure  we only get to hear his side of the story  but knowing women today  it sounds quite plausible ,5,
 Vaquera Soto Maybe instead of blaming the dude  you could ve said it was the responsibility of the wife to make things work  Not everyone like the American lifestyle where everyone lives separately  Maybe some people like a joint family  But not  the wife just left instead of putting in the effort to make the marriage work  If she will just be with him if all things are fine and rosy  then she s the problem  not him ,8,
Do not marry someone like him who moved his wife and child into his parents house when the mother in law doesn t like his wife  Common sense such a move will affect your marriage  He s a momma s boy ,10,
 Mumin Marriage and a partner are two wholly different things  Conflating the two is often painful and expensive these days ,4,
for sure u wud have to sacrifice adjustments on a lot of things    but i guess for some    its really worth it  without a partner wudnt old age be very lonely  ,2,
 Kristian Schmidt Underrated comment ,1,
As a woman  I concur ,5,
Just never get married  as a millionaire   I m exhausted just hearing about it ,4,
I m married and I have a great life  In fact if it wasnt for her  I probably wouldnt be as successful and I m now  srs ,18,
We can marry  but it s potentially very expensive  It may require doing tit for tat and be willing to burn down the house  because that is what it takes to make some women sane  that you mirror their insanity ,7,
With the right person it s a good idea  with the wrong person it s a bad idea,18,
Get married to a Millionaire,5,
Yep  Even friendships are problematic these days ,19,
as soon as I began think about this  marriage  thing a couple of years ago  I never heard once a positive thing about it  friends and strangers alike  it sincerely became a phobia for me,37,
 Mohamed Abdalnaem watch how you get divorced lol,13,
 Ralph B i feel sorry for laughing hard at your misery,17,
Yep ruined my life as well  as a non millionair ,70,
I agree mate,22,

Making even more money after ruining my wife s life  as a millionaire  by talking about it ,12,0
I think marriage is about finding a good match  I don t believe there s value in struggling in a relationship  I believe there is value in finding a good match where people get each other and things just flow smoothly  I think we should struggle on more important things  like improving the world  Spending a lifetime arguing with someone as if somehow we re  growing  in some profound sense doesn t sound appealing to me at all  When I argue I don t find I learn much  When I spend hours and hours reflecting on my behavior  I don t find that either  I only find that I m evolving when I m actually grabbing books and acquiring knowledge  or improving on skills  like social skills  art skills  engineering  and so on  But marrying someone who just doesn t fit with me seems like a major waste of time and energy  Life can be wonderful if we avoid the dumb pitfalls ,1,1

That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to you,768,26
 CodeThatTalks you re only hearing the story from this guy and he s a weirdo u actually believe him  I support his wife she s doing a great job,1,
 Nik s One Life Did you see an update   He got reunited with his son after 8 months   Hopefully those 8 months made him think a bit and effect some positive changes in his life and make him a better person  somebody who is beyond a coding machine ,4,
 Samsung Television Idk he seems like he s not that good of a dude  We don t know the other side of the story and based on tech leads past of creating sc4m courses there s a good chance that he was the problem in the marriage,7,
Losing is a kid is unimaginable for many dad s ,5,
 CodeThatTalks Her parents are probably touting for their daughter s courage from leaving such a uncaring  unfeeling  narcissistic and hypocritical emotional deadbeat   He doesn t give a s    about his child anyway   He s probably just pissed that he needs to pay child support because he s a millionaire and is not getting anything back   He doesn t really want to see his child   He probably didn t spend his time with his kid anyway   The way that he treats his wife  treats everything in his life  the child is better with the mom   Oh and an update   He got reunited with his son so his ex wife is better than he thought ,8,
 extreme psyche His ex wife was too nice or didn t have good enough of a divorce lawyer that she didn t take half of his money especially what he did could be considered  emotional abuse    Most of the men coming out of a divorce lose half of their wealth especially in that situation ,6,
 CodeThatTalks I don t think that s a good idea to be honest  My parents are way better off not talking to each other  I don t want to get into the ins and outs of their dysfunctional marriage but the in laws could be just as crazy as his ex wife  Like my dad s mom hit my mother even though her son was in the wrong  I still can t believe that happened it was like a cheesy soap opera   I wish we could ve been a complete family but that just wasn t possible  I m glad my parents got divorced tbh  Luckily for me  my mom didn t move back to her hometown but she did that for me and my sister  We still get to see our dad regularly too so I can t complain too much ,1,
sounds like he married a gold digger who couldnt out dig him lol hes too logical for that,7,
 CodeThatTalks it probably depends on what his ex told her parents  Her parents probably support her because she wouldn t tell the story to make herself the antagonist ,6,
 CodeThatTalks i think the parents will support their daughter no matter what  If there was some social backlash for her actions she wouldn t of done it  She clearly doesn t care about her child and the farther child relationship  Techlead may not have the best jokes but i don t believe he is a bad person to deserve this,19,
I m curious what her parents think about all of this   Their daughter married a very successful guy  had a kid with him  then ran away and kidnapped the child across borders   Do they make excuses for her  or do they view their child s action as wrong and illegal  I ve always heard that honor is a big thing in Japan   Seems like an extremely dishonorable thing to do,31,
 extreme psyche  TechLead doesn t need to live with his  parents  he wants to live with them  that is an achievement ,47,
Coming out of a divorce as a millionaire and not needing to move in with one s parents again is an achievement in itself ,34,
the game   ruin their life  before they can ruin yours LOL,9,
Other than losing his kid  ,69,
His wife stole his child and took him across the globe  But she is the victim  Sounds about right in 2021 ,8,2
 KA Here We have to think clearly as men  Because the government is the entity that allows for such chaos as these insane child support laws  female wins custody most times  alimony  etc  We have to see the wizard that s behind the curtain  Not have a battle of female v  male ,4,

Bruh lol  Techlead making money on YouTube by venting about an argument with his Ex PLUS sending her a video message instead of texting  Man is a genius But on a serious note Techlead  I see you are more emotional in this video than the others  if your Ex is stressing bothering you maybe you can limit the contact with her even more   I understand she has your kid  but you re a smart man  you ll find a way   I wish you the best and I really hope you find people who understand you instead of these toxic people  you re a pretty cool guy  don t give up,3,0
Interesting  strength based hiring  Viewing others by their strengths  if a successful company did that  then good point to try that out ,3,0
Some bitches really are crazy,2,0
 People think they are the TechLead   Until they meet Mr  Patrick   There is always going to be some people who hate you even for no reason  People should learn to celebrate other people s success  be happy for them and not jealous because jealousy is ugly and evil and can happen to people who they least expect it from  Always be humble and never share too much and attract unwanted attention    Don t say we need more people like this  no    BE that person the world needs ,1,0
Wow,1,0

 Jake Payne Jealousy makes people snap and kill people more than any other emotion  probably   ,1,
 Rivka Cano comment creator was describing jealousy as  hell  than that s a pretty weak imagination of what hell could be like ,1,
 Jake Payne Expecting people not to feel jealousy is like expecting people to never experience anger   It s a fundamental part of being human ,1,
I disagree  There will ALWAYS be people smarter  better looking  and more successful than you  If other people being successful  depresses  you it means you are a bad person as you don t like to see other people have things you cannot have  which is simply selfish ,3,

  Bek Johansson Family law is a man s worst enemy  it provides an   incentive for both highly emotional   emotion less females to marry   divorce at the drop of a hat  Equality the root of all evil ,6,
