 Ooo yea   ex husband    should have put that on  there     resum               funniest tech lead ever     lol,1,
      v   he is trolling,3,
Bro I m following your advice  hope you are serious about your reviews and not just trolling  ,2,
INVESTING IN CRYPTO NOW IS VERY COOL EXPECIALLY WITH THE CURRENT RISE IN THE MARKET  ACT NOW ,2,42
GOOD VIDEO  EVERYONE NEEDS MORE THAN THEIR BASIC SALARY TO BE FINANCIALLY SECURED  THE BEST THING TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY IS TO INVEST  MONEY LEFT IN SAVINGS ALWAYS END UP USED WITH NO RETURNS ,71,92
  Ethereum is a company  It s token is an unregulated security,1,0
Vitalik unknowing describing the better Eth is basically describing Cardano  Except cardano is already proven to work and is scaling hugely this year ,1,1
The end of the video where he starts to brag about his CV destroys his credibility ,1,0
there s sharding and there s sharting you decide,1,1
Maybe he invented somthing you didnt imagine despite working in google and facebook   ,1,1
Thanks for uploading this video   I m serious  I m doing my research on Ethereum  trying to figure out if it s worth it  and this video gives me a lot of counter arguments to consider instead of just hearing all the ways for which ETH is good ,6,1
TechLead is crying now because ETHEREUM is soaring to the moon now ,1,1
Do you have a problem with Ethereum or Vitalik  If you have some basic blockchain knowledge  its pretty easy to see that you dont know much about it  Some of your statements are basically just not correct  Do some more research and put out some real critics if thats your agenda  I think you are more intersted in bashing Vitalik tho  And sorry to say but Ethereum is scaling right now as we speak ,2,1
if the history isnt enough to show you how ridiculous  eth  is you have there future plans  what was covered here is funny too  eth has stacked so much garbage on top of its blockchain  the simple concept of sending eth gets exponentially higher  the past upgrade and what i heard about the new eip update makes this blockchain even worse  eth has grown to big for its own good ,1,1
Please make more videos like this  What you think of Cardano project  ,1,1
You found a spot between comedy and good information  Thanks for that ,2,1
There s always a butthurt crypto junkie in the comments trying to counter TL  What a useless effort ,3,1
What is your view on EOS ,1,1
Why is Techlead becoming so negative day by day  used to love the videos  but not now,2,1
From a personal point of view I feel crypto got to be best thing that has happened to the financial market for awhile now  it continues to open room for bulk gains whether in holding or most importantly trading  looking closely at Ethereum it started a fresh rally above the resistance zone against the US Dollar and it seems there is high chance for more upside  and the current trend would reveal the amount of institutes that have embraced the use of the crypto assets to optimal results thats why i will say ETH is only just in the early stage of a bigger surge  Considering the the bulk return one get from trading than just holding it might be too late buy an asset while holding but its never late to buy in while trading crypto and with trading crypto i have gained  170K in my portfolio but i didnt do it all by myself but with accurate strategy and signals from an expert trader Chen lawrence   With Adam help I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin  you can easily get to Isaac  on  Teleg  ram   chentradingi   1 724 228 4787 on whatpp ,2,0

Can I give you some advice  Go and create a business that actually makes something that people will pay for and I feel you will be happy and content that you did something with your life  I am multi qualified from multiple universities  a self made multi millionaire and I don t brag about it  Stop analysing everyone else s life  You seem to me to be lost with no direction  Yes your analysis seems solid and you sound smart but most people already realise what your saying is correct before you telling us  O yes  I don t have a linked in page what ever that is because I have been self employed most of my life and I don t care about other peoples profiles  I listen and communicate with people who I think I might be interested in or want to work with   You may have a good moral compasses but you have a diminishing legacy ,1,0
As a long time watcher of TL  I can sense his jealousy toward vitalik beneath those dry humors  Well  I myself is also jealous of Vitalik   Who doesn t    Who s creating a new monetary system at 19yo   I doubt vitalik has imposter syndrome  Dude probably knows that he s literally one of the smartest person on earth currently living rn,8,0
You are hilarious man  and right ,1,0
Reminds me how Perl 6 was supposed to save Perl by introducing all these new features but ended up taking too many years to develop and became dead on arrival   ,2,0
Vitalik should ask this guy to make his own token   just under the market cap of Bitcoin  ,1,0
Do you idiots not realize that the crypto market has already crashed weeks ago  China banned crypto as a whole  The biggest crypto holders in China sold  and the bitcoin market cap dropped  eastern countries are fighting to do the same thing  This video was posted before the crypto market tanked  the US government is trying to gain control of the crypto market meaning the only good time to buy crypto was when it was trending way back when crypto as a whole was on the rise  The only good news we got is that there s a high probability that cryptos here to stay  95  sure   You guys probably don t even hold crypto  you use the term paper hands and hold for the trend instead of using your brains like a normal human smh ,1,0

He s not like other brokers that will start telling you stories and excuses why they trade didn t go well after collecting your money,1,
I ve never heard or seen any of he s clients complain of lost      I think he s just too perfect,1,
Seeing alot of success stories  he s must be an honest and trustworthy person for people to say this good about him,1,
Really y all know him   I even thought I m the only one who he has helped walked through the fears and falls of trading,1,

Trading on your own is very risky I ve lost Alot trading for myself,1,
Trading crypto now will be very nice but trading with out a professional is not,1,

Vitalik needs to get a job  as a millionaire      ,1,0
all this guy talks about is selling off his crypto,2,0
wait  techlead was at googlel  facebook and microsoft  i didnt even knew  KAPPA  sorry  i love you but i had to say this  D,1,1
I think it s very important for him to point out that he s a millionaire ,80,4
It is important   It demonstrates that he understands money and investment  ,6,
He sure loves to throw shade on people who are more intelligent than himself ,1,

He is selling his ethereum  Must mean it is about to go to the moon  this guy is a joke ,1,2
The crypto market crashed a while ago smh  do you even hold crypto ,1,
So I can still mine etherium ,1,1
When I first watched this  I disagreed with your overall ETH assessment  see my previous note    I ve changed my mind   There are several coins  not tokens  that are much better than ETH  They offer incredible speed  much lower transaction fees  sub penny   long term business plans  near infinite scalability  and even the same EVM  I m not going to shill any one of them  There are several worthy projects  and L2 solutions like Polygon are not among them   ETH is not going to be the future  I think ETH will eventually collapse once people figure it out  There may be more gains for the next year or so  but ETH2 is not coming and 1559 will not save ETH  In fact  I think 1559 might be the ETH killer because everybody knows that people buy the rumor and sell the news in crypto  I will be completely out of ETH before 1559 goes live   Thanks for the video ,2,3

Using Ethe reum Classic s movement between April 14 17 as reference points  some Fibonacci levels were highlighted on the 4 hour timeframe  The 100  extension level rested at  54 7 but a look at the on chain metrics suggested a pullback even though E T C was quite bullish over the last 24 hours  RSI highlighted overbought conditions in the m rket for the last few days and stabilization was likely moving forward  This could take place at the 78 6  Fibonacci level   48 3  which would establish it as a strong support point  Another area of support rested at  42 43 and this even coincided with the 50 SMA  Meanwhile  Chain kin Money Flow maintained itself above the half line as capital inflows were healthy towards E T C   As hard as it is tradlng Crypt0 is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just study the ch rts and the support resistance and pay attention to what s going on  the crypt0 industry has exploded in recent in months but the none of this is without challenges  I m not a pro trader but I was lucky to make enough  since  late last year following the instructions and the best sign ls of Prof Greg Darrell  What are the steps you ve taken to deliver a simple user experience  Delivering a simple user experience has been Prof darrell s goal since day one  so naturally it s something we have focused oN  He runs program for  nvestors newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng Bitc0in works  to help them utilise the volatility of the crypt0 m rket and also stack up more asset  He s an expert tra der and finance journalist and you can find his free courses on tradlng on the web and he can be reached on  and Te  gram      Gregdarrell  OR  Gregdarrell06 gmailcom  for more inquires into profitable trad ng ,95,11
No one is ever gonna believe these  It doesn t make any sense that a group of people in the comment section all know the same unknown person ,2,
I have heard a lot about this guy with his brilliant strategy and s gnal  on so many channels here on YouTube  some call him the crypto messiah  could he be the new wolf on crypto street  He must be a guru for people to keep talking about him  will reach out to him,1,
The danger with Crypto stock investing is not knowing what you don t know  Prof Greg made me realize I didn t know much at all  Fortunately  I found his c0ntact before any serious financial damage occurred ,1,
Despite all the analysis of various youtubers  Elon Musk just posted a tweet and crashed the entire crypto market  I think everyone should be smart by now   Seek appropriate guidance before investing in this highly complex market  With the help of Prof  Greg  I ve made over 10 215 B tc out of 2 5 Bt c allocations in the past 2 months  Things can get worse  so act smarter,2,
Generally  profits and losses are almost unlimited in BTC  Mostly  it depends on your risk appetite  your trading strategy and get a professional ,1,
Nice information and i appreciate your concern cos this will help a lot especially to the young bitcoin investors who have no or lesser knowledge on how bitcoin market works,1,
Trading isn t all about watching videos on YouTube  achieving success in trading requires trading under professional supervision  trading with Prof Ryan  platform has been a life changing decision for me ,1,
I ve heard arguments like these from bch and bsv folks,2,1

Ethereum gas prices are ridiculous  Swapping tokens sucks  Eth will die a slow death    Why people use it is beyond me  No way this is a viable currency with transaction fees that high  Cheaper to overdraft a couple credit cards than to pay someone on  an ethereum blockchain,1,1

A previous analysis highlighted a symmetrical shape but Bitc0in Cash was yet to break out from the pattern  A closer look at the Visible Range showed that the highest number of trades were initiated around  650  representing the lower trendline of the pattern  Hence  this area of support looked strong for B C H and there was a chance that bulls defend this zone from a breakdown  On the other hand  the upper trendline coincided with 200 SMA which could act as a barrier in case of an upwards breakout  MACD line did trade above the half line  but the bulls were losing momentum according to the histogram  RSI was still in bearish territory  indicating weakness in the market  This is the perfect timing to stock up your crypt0 asset  and there are two approaches to increasing your asset as an investor first is by buying little bits of crypt0 subsequently and the second which is a preferred and better option is tradlng because it is less capital intensive and more profitable  I tr de daily with trade s gnals from Bryant miller and my earnings has increased so much   I can boast of the effectiveness of Mr  Bryant s tr de s gnals and he also have some free courses on google for any tr der trying to set up for proper profitability and he can be reached on               1 253 231 7125  or        bryantmillertrade gmailcom  for further tradlng advice on being profitable ,1,1

Nice video   very engaging from the beginning to the end  People will be kicking themselves regrets in a few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in Bitcoin It s a pity that most people out there struggling through intense hardship and have ignored Bitcoin  were as Bitcoin can uplift there financial status,43,8
BITCOIN IS THE ONLY TRUE DEMOCRACY EVER EXISTS IN IN THE WORD,1,
Bitcoin has seen some massive momentum that has allowed it to erase a good portion of the losses that came about due to the recent plunge  This sell off marked capitulation amongst investors  with many clearly fearing that the multi month uptrend that led BTC to its all time highs was over and that a deep retrace was imminent  Nonetheless  bulls have since gained full control over the crypto s price action  and it is now positioned to see significantly further near term upside  There was a break below the 200 day moving average indicating the bulls are trying to surmount and a firm break above this level could confirm that this bounce marks a full reversal of the recent downtrend  Staying profitable round the clock should be the goal of every investor and trader alike  which is why I trade daily to increase my holdings  Even though I am not an expert trader  I always ensure to trade efficiently by copying and using trade signals of expert traders  and Steve Keen the best signal provider I have come across because of his trade signals being copied in my trades enormous amount in BTC in my portfolio  for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related concerns  He can be reached Via Te e   m        Keensignals  ,31,10

 The fees are high  so no one s using the network   Ethereum s fees are based on people using the network  Fees are high because so many people are using the network  As a user  if you want lower fees  go to edit fee  and do the slower cheaper fee  The more people that do that  the lower fees get for everyone  Fees are so high  bc people are willing to pay that much  a lot of people ,57,15

You compare Vitalik to you  You should compare him to Zuck or Gates  At least he started something of his own ,71,6
Err you think Zuck and Gates started their own projects because you re brainwashed  Vitalik also smells  Use your nose  Do you also think Elon is the brain behind a dozen projects  I hope not ,2,

8 44  Ethereium is so complicated that nobody understands what s going on   pretentious blog that s so opaque and full of technical jargon that s meant to be dazzle       TL       It is obvious  therefore  that in order to be effective a doctrine must not be understood  but has rather to be believed in  We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand  A doctrine that is understood is shorn of its strength     If a doctrine is not unintelligible  it has to be vague  and if neither unintelligible nor vague  it has to be unverifiable  One has to get to heaven or the distant future to determine the truth of an effective doctrine  When some part of a doctrine is relatively simple  there is a tendency among the faithful to complicate and obscure it  Simple words are made pregnant with meaning and made to look like symbols in a secret message     Eric Hoffer,1,0

I mined cryptocurrencies on a 6 GPU mining rig I made in 2017 18  and I turned it off during the crash of 2017 because it didn t make any sense to keep it running with the electricity costs  The cost outlay was about  4k to make this machine  and I lost money on that  and on the electricity costs  It was a learning experience in building a high processor powered PC  I made some money with it  but the idea that these machines are running and burning all this electricity without it itself being reusable  made me feel very gross doing the mining   Your take about the scalability of the gas fees and users  is a similar conclusion I have  Another barrier to adoption in my opinion  as a UX Designer  is the technical barrier of knowledge needed to open an account and BUY cryptocurrency in general  Its intimidating  esoteric and not user friendly whatsoever   All in all  I m still interested in the concepts behind Blockchain technology but the caul has been lifted from my eyes a bit in terms of the scalability of all this ,1,0

 Alex I get what you and Vitalik are saying when you say stuff like that  but      Ethereum has alot of ideals baked into it that haven t proven to be reality yet  It is the dream of Vitalik that can t escape his person  because his person seems to be a little too big  which is probably why Cardano had to become a thing  It doesn t depend on him but I think he is leading it  and it wouldn t do well without him  Open sourced or not  it needs a leader just like everything else because the version everyone has their money staked in is the version that needs to succeed  and that version is still Vitalik s baby ,1,
 Cecil McIntosh it s an open source project  It doesn t rely solely on vitalik ,6,
 AR 7 I don t think it was a joke  He is literally saying that the founder of Ethereum is not qualified to lead a project so massive  and he is right in my opinion  These crypto projects are garage projects that are way over hyped along with their founders  The project that will actually be capable of serving the world is probably not in existence yet  and if it is it is probably Algorand  Solana  maybe cardano  and most probably XLM   Ethereum is a darling  but will not stand the test of time ,8,
 two27 Did you know that it was a joke right ,14,

The problem is  a lot of people don t respect Elon musk anymore and see that Elon musk is just manipulating the market  I noticed this last manipulation by Elon musk didn t pop the crypto market the way it did the first time he mentioned dodge coin    I think if the Ethereum leader guy tweeted something good about Ethereum the market would pop a lot more than if Elon tweeted something good about Ethereum  In other words  I m saying Elon musk is losing his influence ,1,0

I love the possibilities of blockchain but Ethereum as an example is really best at a subset of some problems but really bad at a wider range of others    Great for keeping track of things over time and light weight in data and complexity   Still a ways to go   Also there are a ton of projects out there too all trying to do the same thing more or less ,1,0

Bitcoin has seen massive momentum that has enabled it to erase much of the losses caused by the recent slump  This sell off was a surrender among investors  and many clearly feared that the multi month uptrend that led BTC to its all time highs was over and a deep regression was imminent  Nevertheless  the bulls have now gained full control over the price development of the crypto and are now able to record a clear further upward trend in the short term  There was a break below the 200 day moving average  indicating that the bulls are tryn to break through and a firm break above that level could confirm that this rebound is a complete reversal of the recent downtrend  Staying profitable 24 7 should be the goal of every investor and trader  which is why I trade daily to increase my holdings  Although I am not an expert  I always make sure that I can trade efficiently by copying and using BTC trading signals from experts and Raymond Anthony  the best signal provider I have ever seen  in my portfolio  For his support with strictly cryptic problems he can be reached via  TELEGRAM  Raymondsam01  ,26,4

Have huge respect for Teachlead but trying to low blow Vitalik because he didn t work at google or facebook is just a low move  Don t know much about him but Vitalik at 27 being worth around a billion means something  Even Elon Musk wasn t wroth that much at 27   not saying Vitalik is better then Musk   just saying,19,5
But that Vitalik blog post is lame and much respect to TechLead for putting the spotlight in his own colourful way ,4,
He was half joking  He s actually right when he says the dude doesn t have experience architecting large scalable projects even if he might be a genius  If he had worked at a good sized company  he would have seen the architecture and technologies involved in scaling and proper design  We are relying on one college dropout to deliver on a 300B project  Some dropouts are able to create Facebook  but for every Mark Zuckersburg success there are probably 1000 failure dropouts whose product didn t take off ,5,

Where are tables now  No one use them anymore,2,
 Not Impressed even thinking of it as an oversized phone only makes sense if you consider the iPhone when before most phones were dumb  The form factor itself can be considered an innovation  There are a lot more things you can use with a more portable computer and I know a lot of people who use computers more often due to the different form factor   maybe not the best analogy  but the idea is that it s something people actually use that seems seems silly at first glance ,1,
Tablets are just an obvious mid point between phones and laptops  Zero innovation went into the iPad  You can think of it as an oversized phone or as a small laptop with a really shitty keyboard  It gets comical when people then attach an actual keyboard and mouse to one  At that point you ve disassembled a laptop and raised its cost by including a pointless touch screen you won t use  Tablets are a pointless gimmick ,3,

 Price prediction outlets are falling in line with this belief  Outlets like DigitalCoinPrice and WalletInvestor are not counting on ETH shooting past  4 000 again in the near future  Price predictions from DigitalCoinPrice suggest an end of year value of just under  3 400  WalletInvestor predicts a value of  3 700 for May 2022  ,1,1
Sorry but this video is nonsense  Comparing vitalik for dropping out of college and didnt have a job at a FANG company as a bad thing is just out of this world  This man created ethereum which is the second biggest decentralized cryptocurrency and most dapps run on this network  Vitalik spent like the last 8 years just working for ethereum and build something real valuable instead of you  Of course vitalik is describing in his blogpost the details of the technology about decentralization because he is developing it and wants that other guys will also understand this  In my opinion this video shows that you have no clue what decentralization is and why it is important ,3,1
Thank you TechLead Patrick for explaining this  crypto clusterf ck  which was all I needed to know  Looks like the geeks got pwned by whichever entity created the whole Bitcoin thing and released it to naive and idealistic geeks who underestimate 1  the absolute power of the money masters to control almost all aspects of the world to protect said monetary control and 2  the chaos of a very smart but also very disorganized and even self sabotaging global tech community  Looks like the whole point of Bitcoin was to normalize and usher in the era of fully tracked CBDC  while ensuring most peons can t get rich from it  and thus become independent of the control system  ,2,1

It s always been overhyped  IBM Blockchain is what these people want  not Eth hype  It was entirely hyped  for sure   Litecoin makes more sense for sure than Ethereum as Litecoin is faster than bitcoin  while eth is a contract concept that is already done with IBM Blockchain for years ,1,2
This video is a testament to TechLead s utter ignorance  I honestly didn t expect you to act like a toddler in this video and rant about things you didn t spend more than 2 seconds thinking about the topic    Disclaimer  I recognize that ETH has its many flaws including scalability  and it has a long way to go  I also recognize that Vitalik is far from perfect and should rightfully be criticized for any actions that are misguided    Vitalik was discussing scalability in general which Elon thought was trivial  He is not saying Proof of Stake won t work  Proof of Stake works and it is an improvement in many areas compared to Proof of work  which dogecoin is based on   He s just refuting the idea that scalability is easily solved   Your ad hominem and handwaving his technical post away  if anything  just shows that this is above your pay grade  I m sure you can understand it if you tried to bring down your pretentiousness a notch   You had to bring up imposter syndrome and inferiority complexes just to attack him personally  A confident person with valid arguments wouldn t need to use such accusations and armchair psychiatric diagnostics if you had the facts to back your arguments up   It s also interesting how you compared Ethereum to women  and seeing how you talk about Ethereum is quite telling about how you think of women and probably treated your ex wife in general   Btw  you re quite foolish if you think that Elon is someone you d want to support you  If anything  Elon staying away from a project only makes it more stable and less susceptible to his abrupt tantrums  His doge meme reply just shows how much of a troll he is  and while he s a visionary I respect for his works  but not his character   you d be dumb to follow whatever he says   Overall  disappointing video  I really thought you were smarter than this ,1,0
9 38 The Elon musk you were talking about earlier in this video   thought of creating his own company in 1995 because he couldn t get a job in any of the internet companies   And if Vitalik was such a conman   why would most badass president Putin invite him   ,2,1
I m brand new to the Bitcoin Crypto universe  and I have a few questions for you   First  after you just liquidated ALL of your positions in the two top cryptos  what do you suggest I buy to replace them   I noticed you like stable coins  but they go against the very concept of cryptos in the first place a safe  de centralized placed to park your money while stable coins are just the opposite  and the reason why China has banned Bitcoin many years ago   Now  they have gone with their own digital version of their own Renminbi  where they can track every  single transaction you make   Doesn t that defeat the primary goal of Bitcoin and cryptos in general  ,2,0
It s so refreshing to see everything I think about Ethereum being said in such a clean way   Ethereum got caught in weird narrative and technical directions just because it needed to antagonize Bitcoin at the beginning   Now  it s too late to change the direction of the project   In fact  almost everything Elon said about changing bitcoin parameters in a dumb way is EXACTLY what Ethereum did back at the beginning   Now Vitalik tries to defend ETH from the same bullshit he himself threw at bitcoin   Time will tell but I think it ETH will be substituted by centralized blockchains like BSC  or by others like SOL ADA  because it s very simply to replicate ETH   Bitcoin  on another side  can t be replicated ,4,1

I hope some parts of this video were sarcasm or else this guy is an absolute joke  ,1,0
Talk about it king  Been waiting for this one,1,0
The only thing I understood from this video is  Ether is like trying to land a Hot Tinder date  very complicated but I still swipe right and try anyway,1,1
Really enjoying these videos  So insightful and funny  Brilliant   ,1,0
 Vitalik doesn t have much of a resume  He s just a college dropout  Unlike me  who worked at Facebook  founded by a college dropout   ,422,17
              they both dropped out of their PhD programs,1,
 Stephen Aldaco you re literally the one following others lmfao,1,
 J  C  Are you joking  Ethereum has thousands of developers working on it  This is also not including the thousands of miners that are securing the blockchain  Vitalik himself is currently the world s youngest billionaire ,5,
I didn t know that Zuck created Facebook  I always though that it was a DARPA project called lifelog ,2,
Wow impressive resume no one cares  He s a free thinker and created his own project while you follow others who s the real leader here ,16,
   this YouTuber is pure comedy  I just watch his videos so I can do the exact opposite ,12,
Zuckerberg never interned at any company before founding Facebook    Not all college dropouts are created equal ,5,
 J  C  what do you mean   Ethereum has employees ,6,
By the way  Google is founded by Stanford PhD s,16,
Except no one works for this drop out,3,
ironic  right ,33,
This is postmodern parody,1,0
Thank you for the video man  you are very amazing with all of this explanation  Not yet a millionaire but hoping soon   ,2,0
 go and work at Google or Facebook  xDDDD,1,1
With that much sharding  gas prices should fall  just hope we don t run out of tp ,3,1
Watching a millionaire employee offer a billionaire employer advice    on how to become an employee  amusing ,176,10
uhhh TechLead is self employed lmao  and he made great points ,1,
Bruh he was trolling,1,
 abdirahman abdiqani he s already a multibillionaire    ,5,
 Billionaire on paper    If Ether does not realize it s speculative potential and crashes  then He will be the furthest thing from a billionaire  Techlead  on the other hand is a retired millionaire who was both an employee and an employer  Given his broad experience  you could argue this is nothing more than constructive or deserved criticism,7,
 pepe i wouldnt say that  what s your argument  Mr Z s business has scaled well  let s see if Mr B s project  is able to scale w o getting too complicated to maintain ,1,
 En la CdMX Mark Zuckerberg also needs more actual Job experience    ,15,
More like techlead being a troll as usual,34,
He just suggested he needs more actual job experience,10,
So we should buy more ETH ,1,1
I agree,1,1
Anyone else agree that Vitalik needs Tech Lead if he wants to get Eth 2 0 otherwise there s no hope for him ,2,0
Gold back crypto will be the future ,1,1
Still love my Ethereum but I loved this anyway    Why did you buy some in the first place  though ,1,0
Man  You are just awesome  AND FUNNY ,1,1
Just because some individuals  in this case  you  can t understand a single thing an expert in their field is talking about  doesn t mean it is  bonkers    If that were the case  we would all be flat earthers ,10,1
3 videos in 1 ,1,1
So many mad people here  ,3,1
From the comment section you can see alot of eth investors lol,2,1
Just move over to BSV  The original Bitcoin design can do everything ETH is trying to already  It scales unbounded with nano fees  No need for ETH or alle the other shitcoins  Bitcoin unfucked just works better then anything out there ,1,1
So  go solve it   This time  or once again   neither the content nor the deliver is a fair one  Scalability might be an issue not only with technology  but with humans too   P S  nor its delivery ,1,0
Man   i love this guy,1,0
Haha like your video ,1,1
It s funny since I thought maybe Elon would turn to something like Ethereum later on  who knows maybe he will  still after seeing this probably not  Also this isn t the first time Elon has thrown shade at Vitalik  It happened a long time ago before he was a supporter of Bitcoin  It s hard to find since Vitalik deleted his post s  that Elon responded to ,6,0
Blah blah blah,1,1
0 03 Only TechLead can make  ethereum  sound this sexy  ,1,0
I like your videos  You should make a video of dogecoin and elon leadership behind it  Let us have it  give us the raw truth  I m invested so I would like to see the reality of an computer engineer millionaire  Thanks  P s  you are a master roaster  Haha,1,0
He need to tattoo ex Google ex Google as a millionaire on his forehead  ,1,0
Smart and funny  A rare combination ,2,0
You were stating how Vitalik has  inferiority complex  and that he was trying to look smart  but then you started to show off with your biography    haha,177,9
it clearly shows who really has the inferiority complex  who is all day talking about his money and past work  yet is completely alone,1,
 Hypernation actually what TechLead said  albeit using tons of sarcasm makes perfect sense  Average joes are not going to install nodes on their devices to keep ethereum secure  It s just stupid  And it s obvious that Vitalik is trying to make himself look competent and knowledgeable and super intelligent  I used to work at a crypto startup and the founder of that startup was precisely the same  except Vitalik knows at least something  our guy didn t know anything whatsoever   And the comparing of LinkedIn profiles was obviously a joke ,8,
 Matthias Kaufman right  All this  All he did was found ethereum  look at my experiences   Lol I mean if hes gonna compare  I think vb s net worth is higher than this guy    so why didn t this guy create ethereum or an ethereum killer ,2,
 buenavista62 yea as if that was a joke  This dude just doesn t know what he s talking about with regard to Ethereum  Like me saying because I m an electrical engineer I m qualified to work on a Falcon 9 lol everybody is an expert in everything nowadays,4,
 buenavista62 It s hard to tell when he s being serious and when it s just for comedy  Usually it s a bit of both ,3,
 buenavista62 not at this time  don t think he meant it as a humour this time lol,4,
r whoosh,18,
That s his humor,39,
so true XD,2,
BILLIONAIRE vitalik vs unemployed ex google ex facebook MILLIONAIRE  I laughed when he asked Vitalik to buy his course to work at FANG as a BILLIONAIRE   Pretty sure techlead just doing his sarcasm stuff,134,11
 Arturo Garza  Why would he cash out of an asset that is appreciating in value every year     Because it could tank at any moment and then he d have nothing   All he needs to do is borrow against it    Just go into a debt of millions of dollars against a security that could vanish overnight  LOL,2,
Just because someone is a billionaire doesn t mean he is being honest and knows what he s doing  There is plenty of luck in the world ,1,
yea this entire video must be ironic no way he s serious,1,
If Elon Musk tries to cash out all his Tesla stock  the same would happen,2,
Lol Vitalik is a paper billionaire  Created a useless tokenomics blockchain with no real world use  Even if he tried cashing out  100million of his eth it was crash the eth market  Fake billionaire ,5,
He didn t suggest that for money  but for learning ,4,
As a millionaire vs billionaire lol  ,2,
Cardano is probably just as useless ,1,1
This is a disingenuous takedown of ETH  where all the problem statements are read in the blog post  but none of the solutions  There s plenty of valid criticisms of ETH  but none of these are them   Most of the world hasn t worked at Google  ETH is Vitalik s first project  more or less  He started working on it as a teenager   And as little as ETH is used  it s the most used Turing Complete blockchain   And Elon is a complete jackass  Having him  on your team  is a wildcard  Just ask Bitcoiners   Just because  you  don t understand it doesn t mean no one can understand it  Maybe you need to level up ,1,1
I think pointing out he didnt work is not valid  Zuckeburg did not have a job and dropped out to start facebook  Last time I checked he was doing okay ,1,0
Sounds like Elon is trying to dump ETH so he can buy it cheap  Elon is having fun manipulating the market  Which will bring in regulators  Elon is bad for crypto ,3,1
Techlead reading his LinkedIn was hilarious  ,14,0
I genuinely don t understand if he s joking or not  Accusing Vitalik to be on a high horse  as a millionaire  ,205,11
Vitaliy is a shady  crook,1,
i think i know why he is ex google ex facebook  i too will fired him,1,
 Nicholas H doesn t need to  as a millionaire  LOL,2,
He s not  What he says makes perfect sense ,3,
Yeah this guy is just shilling his services with a flame heavy intro   Nothing techy here   Just marketing mumbo jumbo ,6,

I am still waiting for that killer d app that never came    I know it s too early to wish for that  but is it really  Facebook was made in a couple of months and many other platforms as well    how come vitalik can be this billionaire and yet he can t promote a single real life usage for an app inside his own platform  It bugs me and makes me believe that tech lead is right in this one   ,3,0

When a professional programmer thinks he knows markets but continuously loses hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to trade  You re selling near bottoms  you bought and held near highs  and now you pretend that nobody could have possibly made money in both directions  Hmmmm  but how can you monetize these huge mistakes  I know  Make videos that make you seem like you know how a professional trader thinks  It s not like every trading guru on YouTube hasn t done the same thing  Yes  those  gurus  are all wrong  nearly all the time but man do they make money on ads and selling garbage called  advice  ,20,4
Haha this guy does not understand the fundamentals he s smart no doubt but hasn t interacted with uniswap  aave  yearn finance all his millions he could have billions with a little more research   im screenshotting this for a later date,2,
Making videos is a surer way of making money than gambling in cryptos  It s advice when he shows even smart people can lose money gambling on the stock market or gambling in the casino or gambling in cryptos   A lot of people are sucked in by the people who say it s easy money gambling in the stock market    you buy low and sell high    If it were that easy  everyone would be rich and no one would be poor  right   And TechLead doesn t claim to be a professional guru in trading   And even someone claimed to be one and claimed to have made money gambling  I wouldn t trust him   I have more faith in someone who is honest about losing money trading and wanting others to benefit from the experience than in someone claiming to have made a billion in trading   And TechLead has been successful in other areas of his life  He lost a lot of money but overall  it s not going to make that big a dent in his life  He can make it back again in a year and he s learned from the experience   Gambling is gambling  You cannot persuade me it s anything else  The house always wins   Why don t you make a video and put your experience online and show proof you made a bundle off trading  If you are so wise  you can become rich and make more money by making videos showing how you became rich   Until then  you re just a crypto hustler like a lot of people out there  Maybe even a sad gambling addict ,1,
TechLead pissed when finding out that there are others that are smarter  richer  better programmers  don t need to give themselves titles and brag  and didn t even have to go up the  normal  career ladder to define themselves they are able to do things they want    ,17,0

TechLead should start a new currency  TechCoin,1,0
It s funny that the failed developer  turned YouTube is talking smack about a billionaire who has actually built something useful in the world other than reversing a linked list   He can t even keep a wife or kid with all his  success   Maybe don t give others advice lmao,15,1
The reason people will have ethereum nodes on phones and hard drives is because you will get rewarded in Eth for running them   it s not ludicrous to assume many people would download an app that gives them passive crypto income    I love tech lead but he doesn t really seem to understand crypto or crypto economics  You can t just apply SQL or fiat economic theory and expect it to be equivalent ,1,1
This was a wise breakdown right up until you threw in your own creds nice flex buddy  subtle ,1,0

 shows Vitalik s Linkedin   where he has literally said he doesn t use Linkedin        You think the guy who created ETH is running around for jobs and needs to update his freaking LinkedIn  You think anyone at Google or Facebook would not jump at hiring a guy like that  And anyway since when did the nerdness of a CEO matter at the market value of a cryptocurrency  And how does an ex Google and Facebook engineer not know how to explain a technical blog post and call it  mumbo jumbo  im crying lmao,2,2

Another smart video  What do you think about Litecoin and Charlie Lee ,1,1
I would rate your thoughts 10 out of 10 for Ethereum   Vitalik  He seems like the typo of guy who is ready to show off with his great vocabulary and making things look too much technical to understand  Totally agreeing with you TechLead  Kudos to you man ,3,2

I ve been seeing latley this is becoming a ponzi scheme  Old investors pull out their money profit and tank crypto while new investors have to wait to get a return when new money is pumped in   Not to mention now you have big money moving around putting in a couple million and it goes up 20 30 cents they make a good profit pull out and tanks on the rest of us same concept with the stock market   At this point I am happy just breaking even so I can get out of this garbage   People are telling you to hold while they are secretly selling ,2,0

He s  judging ETH on its founders reactions and not on the community of owners  the people actually supporting the network  I sense a lot of internal bitterness coming from this guys failed marriage ,4,1
I would self convince myself these later Techlead s crypto content is just for comedy  Nothing he has said these past videos make any sense whatsoever  The humour is so dry that it s not funny at all  Don t take what he said about selling all his holding as financial advice folks ,3,

 Ricardo Reyna that s not how you peer review code   research papers  You peer review before code is merged in  And usually the peer review process takes years before all the kinks are worked out ,1,
 Shaneece P  Ethereum and most blockchains like Bitcoin are decentralized protocols  Anyone in the world can contribute to it  given you ve gone through the appropriate peer reviews and community consensus  In this particular video  he has it seem like Vitalik is the sole developer researcher of the entire project when in fact Vitalik is an Ethereum researcher who occasionally will throw in his opinion  His opinions are looked at  but he has to go through the same process as anyone else  which means Vitalik can build up this framework for how Ethereum should be  and it wouldn t necessarily get adopted  Ethereum has dozens of researchers and developers from across the globe that contribute to the protocol  but if at any point they manage to approve an upgrade that the community didn t want  the community can fork off the changes  No one is forced to adopt any changes made to the protocol ,3,
As a former software engineer  he probably has more insight than most crypto holders  and thus  able to call out bullshit when he sees it  Blockchain has some neat ideas behind it but it alone does not make a currency ,3,

ETH was a dead blockchain from the get go  BSV does everything ETH does  everything BTC does  everything any coin does  and it does it faster   cheaper  and more securely than anything else out there  All on single layer  and elegantly simple ,1,1
Vitalik is very much like Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin who never had to work for anyone before they founded Facebook and Google  That s what geniuses are capable of   You brag about working for facebook and google but ended up as a glorified youtuber  The irony,37,5
Hahaha  This is so spot on ,2,
Also us crypto lovers need to hear reasonable people disagreeing with our views  at least to avoid confirmation bias  If we attack those we believe are not keepers of as much information as us  we become butthurt people with the same mental capacity as SJW  Let s let him have his say  and if we disagree  we can also owe him our side of things  I find him maybe a bit arrogant at times in the way he words things and use hir past credentials for his current position of knowledge  but I also am not an English native and may have misinterpreted the language,8,
 Kashtv and he has  00001  the money of Vitalik  the guy he s bashing  Ironic,7,
but he still has more money then you lmao,3,
Didn t read the blog post so can t say anything about that  but Ethereum being over engineered rubbish is a well known fact  I read somewhere on some ethereum page that they wanted to move fast and break things  too bad they broke everything  Projects with a measured approach backed with plenty of research and study will win out in the end  Cardano is at the forefront of that movement ,2,0
Or if you re genuinely interested in the technology  utility  and actual long term usefulness  go for BSV  It s the only one that makes sense ,1,
I suggest you start looking into lower cap exchange tokens like FTX KuCoin and soo on  Atleast exchanges are real profitable businesses  They generate cash from fees and staff thats easy to understand  Buy backs  token burns etc are definitely going to boost the price overtime ,1,

Vitalik  I quadratically sharted  as a billionaire ,11,
Read this comment before watching the full vid    this is all I could hear the whole time ,11,
Vitalik never worked at Google or Facebook  who cares   You worked at these places  but haven t changed the world like he has  jealous much ,1,0
ADA and DOT   ETH,1,0
When I looked at ethereum a few years ago for a solution I was working on  the tech seemed more appropriate for limited domain scale applications  It would have been sufficient for my needs  but decided on another approach so never pursued it further   Thanks for the video though ,2,0
Just don t talk about crypto you re a doomed boomer  etherium is the future and can be updated  don t put more FUD cause you sold low  maybe someone is gonna listen you and sell then feel bad like you ,6,0
Lol Ethereum and Bitcoin definitely ripped you off ,1,0

Waiting for  Techlead to start his own cryptocurrency ,2,1
 How I started Ex coin  as a trillionaire  ,1,
Techlead is way to pessimistic  The fact that you flaunt your success about working with  centralized companies that data mine it s users and offers no solutions or ideas to help disrupt the status quo is exactly why you will never truly understand what we are trying to do  I really hope you prosper even more and feel better  You will buy back in ,34,3
I would take everything Techlead says with a grain of salt  We like him because he is purposely funny and over the top not for life advice  Although sometimes there are nuggets of truth in there  But you have to know them already to appreciate them ,5,
I wouldn t have believed anything that you said  but since you put  as a millionaire  I believe,162,9
 Terrence I understand the project  I just think VK isn t a good leader  The guys over at ADA have a better team and product IMO,2,
 TheBeav30 I think he was mildly joking about the job part  VK is a smart dude and his rise to success is nothing short of amazing  but  ADA and DOT are just better projects in my opinion ,1,
 Viet Hoang I actually thought these recent videos were well informed and pragmatic,1,
Dude has an engineering degree from berkeley and worked in google and facebook as a tech lead  maybe he knows a thing or two about computer science and cryptography  lol,10,
I would self convince myself these later Techlead s crypto content is just for comedy  Nothing he has said these past videos make any sense whatsoever  The humour is so dry that it s not funny at all  Don t take what he said about selling all his holding as financial advice folks ,15,
My problem with TechLead  as a multi billionare  He has a huge ego  He has  all  the answers yet hes only a millionaire  He ll teach you how to land your dream job cuz working for the man is lit  He ll give you the best financial advice ever  SELL NOW at the bottom  after a 50  crash   He s the dankest millionaire ever  totally qualified to give Billionaire s advice  TechLead should stay in his cubicle where he is most comfortable  Clearly that s what he knows best like any trained dog   After all his resume is jam packed with  jobs  working for the man    Vitalick,5,0
