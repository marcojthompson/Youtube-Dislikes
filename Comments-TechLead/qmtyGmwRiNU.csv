When will you upload another video  I want to know when I need to buy high and sell low ,1,
This is funny  did you copy all of the Anonymous video  Haha    ,1,
I think you are a bit liar,2,
The best way to attack the scalability of charging stations is simply to create more charging stations  Imagine for a moment that home chargers could be rented out at individual peoples houses so that no matter where you are it s possible to simply drive in to someone else s yard and use their charger attached to their house  paying them a fee as well as the regular charging fee  Individual people would be able to rent their own house as a charger for certain hours of the day  The individual computers in the car would know who s house was available and for what hours of the day their house was available   The exact same thing could be said about the charges that are located on college campuses  movie theater parking lots and businesses  Ultimately what we need to see is electric vehicle chargers everywhere whether they are superchargers or not  Most people who own an electric car and also have a house will do their best to charge their car at home and only rely on foreign home charges when absolutely necessary ,1,
This guy talks facts,4,

Why I regret selling all my tsla stock just 1 month later  as a millionaire    techlead,1,1
Tesla Bulls r fuk,1,1
Your a emotional investor   Long term is key with Tesla no emotion not drama not Bitcoin it s critical feedbacks brotha,1,1
never bet against Elon even if you lost all the crypto life savings  but I have to confess that you did even better than the anonymous video  stupid decision to sell tesla at the bottom of normal hic hup  you re not an investor  you just want to gamble here and there based on market trends ,1,2
good choise to sell   TechLead,2,1
Actually a good question  Why a tech company doesn t support Bitcoin ,1,1
Sucker   Another emotionally triggered  investor    Tired of the BitCoin snowflakes   BTW  none of the regulatory credits are from the gov t  fool    Better do some research  It s money directly from another manufacturer  Not tax money from the federal government   Poor comprehension of reality   Amazing how bad so many are on fundamental accounting   Tsk tsk    Traders constantly lose money   Badly informed  Believing in marketing like a layman   SMH ,1,1
Yeah but the battery swap is going to experience the same issue since the same battery is going to be installed in multiple cares having the same end result  No ,1,1
 I still see cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investment and i totally love the technology when it comes to the largest crypto asset Bitcoin  As a trader  i have been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to crypto and everyone has their opinions when it comes to choosing sides  though i am not kicking against Hodl  but i see it as an old and odd PICKETT to make profit of the market as when the market goes bearish investors traders loses their investment which is always painful  when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trade alert from a professional trader that understand the market and use PICKETT to generate signals daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as i have been doing with KERRY PICKETT for the past 5 weeks and i have been able to day trade to grow my initial 0 8 btc to 6 8 btc which you will rethink and see that trading is better profitable KERRY PICKETT daily signals are very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment KERRY can be contacted via               PicKerry  on how to trade profitably  ,33,6
Lol you re uploading so many videos now,1,1
Well this didn t aged well lol  Wow you are smart at somethings but as far as accounting and understanding a financial income statement you need to study hard  That bit about Tesla making more money from the bitcoin sale than selling car is just blasphemy  There was CEO compensation that hurt profit and Tesla has made 26B in Revenue since their inception vs a 100M bitcoin profit  The government doesn t give credit to Tesla other OEM s give money credits to Tesla  so essentially other OEM s and funding the Tesla brand new shinny factories ,1,2
to the regulatory credits  They reinvest these  What would you do with a company if someone gave you x amount of money additionally  Set it aside  do nothing just to say  oh look  i made my profit without this money  or use this money for investments  other car companies are literally paying tesla to expand faster   that money is also NOT from the government  You might maybe want to look into what regulatory credits are   Just saying ,1,1
Its funny how this guy is a techlead and a genius in programming but has pretty much no clue about investing  mostly  my friend if your decisions dont become a bit more informed than you will ask for a job at apple  or google or facebook  in 10 years ,1,1
I think NIO is another money grab,1,1
Lmfao       I mean  I can t afford this   ,1,1

I laughed so hard on his recent videos posts  This is typical behavior   Sell Low Buy High  When the rumors die down  price action is back on track  I bet he will post videos something like  I changed my mind  bought back Bitcoin Tesla  ,24,2
Or maybe he just doesn t want to play elon s game,2,

 Paul Lam they are all bots  don t fall for it  it s all over youtube ,1,
I also think it was a very bad move from Tesla to get into Cryptomarket and to hype those shitcoins like dogecoin or cumrocket  But right now they are building 2 more giant Factories  one of the fastest Computers  Dojo  for developing fsd  Gigapresses  Castingmachines  4680 batteries are getting build  fsd beta  drives really good even within cities already   and a great Team  If Tesla really would be in trouble they wouldn t put that much money in inovation  in building new buildings and building a huge computer for their self driving system ,1,0

Tesla q1 earnings 438million dumb arse,1,1
This info is insaine   insta bearish  ,1,0
You are not a good investor  Proof me if I am wrong ,1,1
I seriously think this is a Sarcastic Troll Video   I dont think he seriously thinks what he said here    but    if that was the case     Dude Tesla made 8 BILLION dollars of operating cashflow on the TTM    You didnt know one of Tesla s biggest opportunities is china  You thought they were banned in china  China LOVES Tesla     You might be a millionaire but you dont know anything about investing  Dont just bash things you dont understand ,1,1
The levels of misinformation and low quality information and thought can only point towards trolling or really low IQ when it comes to investing ,1,3
No but his arguments are really bad and extremely low IQ  Starting from  regulatory credits is money from the government   The regulatory credits are carbon credits the government gives to incentivize car manufactures to build more EV cars since they have a limit of how many ICE cars they can make  this is what the credits of the regulatory credits means  a car manufacturer is only allowed certain level of ICE cars in production until they run out of credits and can t build more after that point   Since TSLA only builds EVs they have no use for their credits  so they are sold to other car manufacturers  Toyota  GM  etc etc  Regulatory credits is not a government subsidize or money going to TSLA from the government  is money that TSLA competitors give willingly to TSLA so they can sell ICE cars without the regulatory credits limit  Then the fact that TSLA is  only making money from selling Bitcoin or Regulatory credits  is a stupid argument mostly because TSLA also has 1 time expenses that also affect their balance sheet like paying Elon 300M from his compensation plan or money going to building their new factories that are still not in production  that were partly funded by TSLA competitors btw   Lastly using P E ratio to analyze a growth stock is a mistake that not even the lowest IQ investor would ever make  P E ratio analysis is best applied to consolidated companies or even dying companies not companies that are ramping up production and constantly expanding  example AMZN PE ratio used to be 3000 between 2010 11 and everyone was crying about  muh P E ratio  then and I am sure all the same people crying about that back then now want to off themselves after AMZN basically did a X15 its value since then   There is a lot to complain about TSLA  Elon but this arguments are low hanging fruit that would only be made by someone being intentionally stupid or just a plain stupid person ,2,
Crypto market is becoming more appealing to investors seeking low correlation assets that diversify portfolios  I d say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life  even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position  The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen  I got this tips first hand from Dr  Bernard Theo  He s always a step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings has increased drastlcally from 4 1 B T C to 18 7 B T C in just 2 months and some days  I ve full confidence in his tradlng abilities  You can easily get to him           MrBernardTheo or maiI Bernardxtrades hotmaiICOM ,76,4

Congratulations   You played yourself    I wonder if some of the shares I added to my position were yours  I suppose I may actually owe you a  thank you  ,1,1
Surely if Elon fears a bitcoin crash  he wouldn t have put out meme s that facilitate it  He could put out a positive tweet tomorrow and give it a little pump if he wanted  I think he is buying more than selling ,1,1

Electric cars are a technological step backward over ICE vehicles  imagine you can have an electric car that can recharge in 3 minutes  has a range of 370 miles  will still work in 20 years and is cheaper   Oh wait  we have them already they are called petrol cars ,4,7
This is the dumbest comment Ive ever seen  Imagine if we had unlimited range lasted 25 years and ran on grass  Oh wait we already do they are called horses ,2,

No wonder the progressive champagne communists love Tesla   the company runs on tax money stolen from tax payers     this nicely aligns the company and its customers values   moral settings ,1,1
Tesla never made money from car sales   just from state aid     is their environmental balance really that good considering the toxicity of batteries ,2,1
 Joshua Liu electricity needs to be produced somehow as well   the most  clean  setting would be atom power because solar is not effective enough  In terms of car technology only hydrogen makes sense as it is just the next step using current infrastructure of refineries  gas stations and gas while having no issues with range and toxic batteries ,1,

  I admire the efforts you put in your videos mate  Digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally  It s hard for anyone going against them these days  Though from a trader s perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the community works  Cryptocurrencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come  lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy in the market and whether it isn t too late to buy an asset  when you re holding it could be  but when trading its never too late to buy  A trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price  bulls or bears   I trade using signals from trade expert Prof Jim Rogers Trading Signals  with his guide and signal service i ve made over 15BTC worth of crypto assets over some months with an estimate of 4BTC as a start  You can easily get to him on   I  ramm    rogerscryptos  for crypto inclined issues ,34,9
Trading successfully is when you got the right strategy  Trading with Mr Jim  s strategy has brought me great success  I have never seen a strategy as consistent as his ,1,

I recently had my son enrolled into his trading sessions that guy is really good at what he does  i practically use his s gnals only because those are the one i can vouch for its authenticity ,1,

 Koeniig Tesla model 3 drives like a BMW M car  only faster and better pedal response  ,2,
 M G yes  but saying tesla are the best cars in the world makes no sense  I know people who drive tesla just because of company tax advantage  Even they say that the quality is beyond terrible for that price  They just drive it because they are in the system  but they would not buy another tesla anymore  Saying tesla is the best car in the world just means that they did not try out other car companies or something  but that preference ,3,

Would hate to wait 30 mins to get a battery swap since 6 people are in front of you  I don t think battery swap is a very good argument  It seems like charging at your home  work  or at a charging station would work just as well and take up less space  Also seems like there would be more problems that could happen with battery swap  Someone brings in a bad battery then who pays for it ,7,2
Charging at home is the best option  but on the go   swapping is faster  Being 7th in waiting at a supercharge station could take much longer  Swapping is also better for battery longevity as supercharging decreases its life  while swap stations keep charging them at a nominal pace  Also  the non supercharging nature allows them to not draw fossil generated power    adjust when to draw max power based on rates   The scaling problem is there for every sloution  but it s for the industry to figure it out  Startups like Ample are doing some good work  check them out   they offer swapping services but in form of smaller battery modules on their proprietary battery slates  instead of the entire battery  which expedites the process   eases the handling    they can adjust the numbers according to the car model ,3,
Not everyone can charge at home or at work  In my city probably 95  live in apartment buildings  no personal private garage  Nio s battery swap is a subscription service   you don t own a specific battery  They will replace the bad batteries ,1,

Buying bitcoins is pretty easy but what to do with it then is usually the part laden with so many questions and options  The popular one is buying and holding for long term profit  This strategy in itself may not be a bad idea but possibilities for sure and even more profit exists through tradin as noted by a few of the best traders and content providers on YouTube and other forums  I have made a substantial profit in the bear market when everybody complained and I am poised to make even more now it s quite certain the bulls are about to take charge and the beauty of trading is that  even if there is a correction and the value of the bitcoin reverses and declines  I would still profit off it  Though I am not even close to the best of tradrs  I do this by being smart and utilizing the trad assistance of a very successful trader who provides strategies and signals for new and old traders  I have been using Mr  Marcus Sanchez s system for quite a time now and have never been disappointed as my profit is on the steady  You can get hold of his tradn system on teIe gram Marcus sanchez  for those who may need some guidance to make better and consistent profit from crypto space ,5,6

Even Tesla s average analyst target is higher than its current price  You re looking at the world today and not factoring in the huge foundational investments Tesla has made in its near two decade existence while EVs weren t even on the radar  They ve set up the groundwork and much of it doesn t translate easily for competitors  Tesla approached everything with a first principles mindset and this has led to a lot of innovation as well as friction  no dealerships  no marketing department  all vertically integrated   The Giga Press manufacturing technology requires massive investments to get up and running at the scale they re doing but it also has advantages in structural strength  precision  weight and cost  which will increase margins massively   The other automakers more or less take a regular base and convert it into an EV  I won t even get into their other advantages and high margin future revenue flows  There s a bull case and a bear case but it s so much more complex than you imply here  Play around with some of the models   The woman protesting the brake issue was a liar  as proven by logs   She later apologized and claimed to have done it for  entertainment    BTW  This also doesn t seem like an ideal timing to sell a long term position  There are upcoming catalysts such as the Plaid event  FSD Beta V9 etc  in just a few weeks  Moreover  it has held support several times  550 600  For a long position  there appears to be a lot more upside than downside ,6,0
 Techlead  please buy a Tesla  take a few road trips  and let us know if your opinion changes ,2,3
There are so many positive videos and You Tubers talking about TESLA  they have 2 gigafactories coming online soon  they are years ahead of the competition  I personally believe they will become the most valuable company in the world  I respect your opinion    I personally I m long TESLA shares     we will see how all this pans out,2,3

 Steve Woodward Painful though those losses will be for him but still compared to us probably he can afford it   like his other losses  For those who can t afford such losses  his warning is simply don t come buy Tesla or sell for what you can get now  Cut losses,1,
He s not afraid to say he cocked up on Tesla  Like how he cocked up on Bitcoin and his marriage ,3,
He s cutting his losses    makes sense from that perspective  And he can afford such losses because he s a millionaire    AND he is warning us NOT to get into Tesla ,3,

I still see cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investment and i totally love the technology when it comes to the largest crypto asset Bitcoin  As a trader  i have been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to crypto and everyone has their opinions when it comes to choosing sides  though i am not kicking against Hodl  but i see it as an old and odd strategy to make profit of the market as when the market goes bearish investors traders loses their investment which is always painful  when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trade alert from a professional trader that understand the market and use strategy to generate signals daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as i have been doing with Radon s Bryan  for the past 5 weeks and i have been able to day trade to grow my initial 0 8 btc to 6 8 btc which you will rethink and see that trading is better profitable  Bryan daily signals are very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment  Mr Rado Bryan can be contacted via Telgram   rado cryptobase,4,3

This fundamental analysis is not very good TBH  Very short sighted  Would you rather Tesla hoard money so that they have a better bottom line or invest back in the business so that the company can grow  Income is not the metric for growth companies  the metric is cash flow and future cash flow  Sure they could stop building factories in the interest of short term profits but that s not what they care about  Remember Amazon  Remember when they sacrificed the bottom line in the interest of growth ,2,1

I m a big Tesla bull  This video will age like milk  but I get it  you re not saying Tesla is a bad investment  or a bad company  FSD and Tesla energy will play a big role in their success  Also manufacturing  battery technology  and such  Still subbed ,4,3
TechLead diplomatic way of saying  You going down    Mr Musk     ,4,1
So let me get is straight    Tesla sold a small amount of their Bitcoin when the price was high to take some profits  They are HODLing the rest   This sounds pretty sensible to be  This is the correct way to invest  Buy low  sell high  I wouldn t be surprised if they bought more at these lower prices ,4,3
People will  take revenge from Elon Shortsell Tesla ,3,1
Buy high sell low,256,20
After selling bitcoin in absolute bottom then he sell Tesla also  ,2,
ELON IS God,1,
Don t believe the comments above   these are just fake comments,3,
Better than selling even lower  can always re enter when it s even lower  If you re bearish then that s what you should do ,3,
 ari No  perfect example of buy high  sell low  is all the people that bought when youtubers told them to buy when it was the all time high  Like  cryptosrus,4,
    as a millionaire  ,3,
Like who isn t in profit on Tesla unless you a newbie and started buying stocks this year  The stock is just way too priced in and over valued ,5,
I would take the profit and go to Ford    They are crushing it    No hype just hard work    With Lordestown going belly up   FORD will increase share price   They are under 17 ,5,4
From recent tweets you can read Tesla divorced Bitcoin  They have none today ,6,6

These kids think he just started buying stocks and crypto ,4,
Don t think he s actually a millionaire either if he can t afford a Tesla  ,1,
It s crazy      im out,1,
he probably doesnt even buy tesla or the cryptos he talks about  just using them for views,2,
He makes enough money off these YouTube videos to get his gains back lol ,4,
Buy high sell low  never hold  As a millionaire ,7,
The only way to know if he is selling at a loss is to know at what price he bought  If he got in very early he is still making profits  Sure  not a much as selling in December  but more that in a few weeks if he expects the stock to drop a lot more ,7,
Does he though  He said he sold his crypto in april prior to the crash  so its likely he was in profit at the time  Look at the market now ,19,

Great content as usual  Best YouTube channel   ,4,1
Love all the great info u provide,4,1
Great video   I wouldn t put my money in Tesla for the short term   Long term it is difficult to bet against Elon   Variables always change ,26,6
My prediction  one day Elon will disappear faster than he appeared ,3,
That s why he s gonna have a video on buying it back  He s just gaming the algorithm with these titles and topics ,3,
Electric Vehicles are not yet a viable solution   they pollute even more than petrol engine vehicles as the batteries cannot be recycled and they pollute the soil for decades  The materials of these lithium batteries are rare and require A LOT of mining  therefore causing more damage  Also  everyone using these battery powered cars  are connecting them to an electric system whose power plant probably relies on regular methods used to power these electric grids  I could continue but I will stop here  Oh  by the way  this research we actually did for a stupid university that wanted us to find  reasons to make electric vehicles appealing          unfortunately for the university  my group was honest and actually said the truth  They failed us for telling the truth  We said  fine but  it s still the truth   True story ,2,1

I m a Big fan of your videos so I ll wait for your next video when you buy it back   ,134,5
Rather own Tesla than apple or google  even tho google is good stock too  to me revenue growth is the most important metric when I invest  not P E,3,1
Why no mention of Toyota   The BZ4x is coming out next year and they re likely to overthrow Tesla and everyone else   What do you have against Japanese car ,1,1
So this is now investment advisor channel  Cool ,11,2

 Clarence Boddicker What makes you qualified to make that assumption  You think you re smarter than Elon and Tesla engineers that are working hands on  on FSD   ,1,
 Clarence Boddicker it will definitely never happen in the old continent  can barely happen in California because     well    they give lots of money to Tesla and Tesla has jobs there ,1,
I agree with you   Tesla is on a ridiculous sale right now   I fully understand it s over true valuation  but it s all that groundbreaking tech that makes them different   Sure  there will be copycats and some decent competition  but Tesla  rolls the ball  and actually DOES get things done   Look at Boring Company   In a single decade they broke all the rules laid by naysayers   I say load up  and be patient   It won t be 30 50 years   They will make great strides regularly   Not Elon s fault that Joe Biden and his handlers are globalists with zero care for the American economy and stock markets   Tesla will still be the great Tesla we know after the smoke clears  and those who hold will benefit   I don t mind if it goes to  500 in the short term  I ll keep taking advantage of those sales   I m not even a big fanboy   I just see tons of value   I like old gasoline American Muscle and classic Porsches  and have no interest in owning a Tesla   But I cannot deny they re almost changing the world single handedly ,5,
George Hotz can make any car do it for  200,2,
Self driving will not happen for another 30 years  Robotaxi maybe in 50 years  I like teslas and Elon  But it will probably never happen   ,4,

I m going to refer to you as Crypto Lead now  I know your videos have been getting bashed on by alot of moon and Lambo boys but just want to say thank you for being realistic and straight forward  Everyone all of a sudden hopped on the crypto train literly this year  I get it  its a big thing it s being talked about everywhere  Now is the time to start talking about crypto currency we might see some unstable bloody few months up ahead but now is the time to start  paying attention to where potential bottems are 7k perhaps 10k    Start talking about other cryptos and expose their sketchyness  Thank you tech lead I typically wouldn t watch your content but now I m always looking forward to your next video ,66,7
 Nik Wish you the best nik and I hope you can squeeze out some financial freedom out of the crypto markets  If your new to the space or been in for a while I would highly suggest entering a trading group  Trade Devil and Crypto BTC Chris and Optical art crypto have amazing trading groups  The whole point of these groups is to find what s moving the market before it moves the market  By the way do not waste your time with BTC  BTC is most likely the worst performing coin in the crypto space  Also I don t like to call this an investors market because its brutal  The key to making money is take profits or someone else will  This is a traders market period  Call me a sheep if thats what makes you feel good    you actually made my day ahaha you gave me a good laugh  I know what I am I know what I have and I know how to spot opportunities  Also don t be surprised if ETH flips BTC for first place I didn t think it was possible but considering their market caps and considering the TOTAL CRYPTO CAP and OTHERS market cap  this is fully possible  I literly remember not that long ago when ETH dumped on me from 230 to 140  yea I bought ETH  This was literly like a year or two years ago I don t even remember exactly the years seem to merge  I can t tell you I know where BTC is going cause I don t but i an defiantly make money on these 5  10  20  50  swings  Am I phased by the hate   No cause I m doing just fine sir and I hope others can learn how to capitalize on this market  I ll tell you right now HODL and moon mentality doesn t work  Im at the point where the only thing stressing me out at this point is a foreign citizenship and exit tax implications  Yea I m in the US but not for long  You probably don t know what I m talking about but hey after you reach financial freedom through crypto you ll understand what I m going through  Anyways good luck sir your gonna need it ,1,
Excellent comment   People just blindly  hope   All that  to the moon  mentality is ridiculous on any investment  specially for those that can t afford to lose that much money    These videos are a realistic point of view  also obviously think for yourself and make a better informed decision ,1,
I agree  Alot of people are  Hype boys  and just like the feeling of saying moon moon  Those are the real sheep,5,

I am all in will Tesla    Just purely believe Elon Musk will take me to Mars           ,2,1
What do you do will the money after you sell TSLA ,2,1
Techlead seriously getting in to the finance space  Does YouTube pay more for these content than tech  FinanceLead ,389,25
I got bored of his usual topics but now he s talking about stocks and crypto i m back watching every video,1,
yes  it does,1,
That has to be the case cuz he always selling the bottom,1,
 Ray Zala  Yes   ,1,
 Lawrence Yeung  Correct   ,1,
YouTube does pay more depending on what you make videos about  It really makes sense  They sell ad space  If your a prospective customer looking to put ads on a video you want your ad on videos that will produce the most and not have social backlash  Which makes sense why things like the redpill MGTOW are not as monetized as something like personal finance where you have like minded people who are good with  or aspire to be  money which   more disposable income  Also he s triggering the algorithm by talking about Bitcoin when its crashing and people are panicking watching every video they can get on and are contemplating selling ,3,
He is FinLead now,8,
YES  By a factor of 5 or more  CPM is probably  70  per 1000 Views ,4,
Finance has one of the highest CPMs on Youtube  Some YouTubers earn around  33 per 1000 clicks  which is nuts  Mixing tech and finance could be a smart move  You would also have a lot of topics to talk about ,14,
I now get preroll crypto investment ads before these vids  so  yes,3,
 Renaldy Pierre I sold all my AMC  As a Millionaire ,3,
He strikes me as being smart enough to,8,
No but he s using the YouTube algorithm trends to grow his audience   I wouldn t be surprise if he s next video is about GameStop and AMC ,63,
Yes,48,
Well done  Tesla is a bubble  Mercedes and others will win the race ,1,0

He s not wrong though   I remember TechLead making a video ages ago about how he lost a lot of money day trading  He s really not the guy to listen to if you re a serious investor  He is funny though  ,20,
