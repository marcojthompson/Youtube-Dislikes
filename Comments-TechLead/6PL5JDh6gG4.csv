   I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate  digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally  its hard for for anyone going against them these days  though from a trader s perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies   lnvesttors on how the community works  crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come  lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy in the market and whether it isn t too late to buy an asset  when you re hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy  a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price  bulls or bears   I trade using signals from trade expert Mrs  Susan Bossmann with her guide and signal service i  ve made over 27B TC worth of crypto assets over some months  only for crypto inclined issues    connect her on               Susanbossmann ,111,2
great post   Very detailed and precise video you put up mate I love your contents  it s funny how some folks out there still haven t accepted the fact that cryptocurrencies continue to reshape the world globally  It s hard for anyone going against it these days  though from a trader s perspective I feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies investors on how the community works  lately the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently open and you can t tell if it is going to bearish or bullish  this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to hold  I d say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back and wait maybe incur some losses along the line  that s a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stock up more coins should be our ultimate goal thereby making profits  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your strategies  I started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 5 5 BTC in just 4weeks  with the right trading strategy given to me by an expert trader Leonard Arthur   His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on T e l e g r a m    ArthurTrade101  and also what sapp    4 4 7 8 6 8 8 0 2 6 7 4  for Crypto related concern ,34,13

All this Crypto supposedly easy money promise is the same as weight loss  pecs and abs shortcuts without sport and diet   everybody knows that it s a lie but some lazy people still hope it s true  it s called wishful thinking  you wish that something is true even if deeply know that it s not true   there s no shortcuts only hard work and people only talk about the lottery winner and never about the million of people who are addicted and lose their money and their family s money hoping that one day they might win the lottery   the risk to lose is so high that it s not worth the risk,1,1

Bitcoin has the best stress to profit ratio ,1,1
Bitcoin has seen massive momentum that has enabled it to erase much of the losses caused by the recent slump  This sell off was a surrender among investors  and many clearly feared that the multi month uptrend that led BTC to its all time highs was over and a deep regression was imminent  Nevertheless  the bulls have now gained full control over the price development of the crypto and are now able to record a clear further upward trend in the short term  i do say it s outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait to contnue incur more losses along the line  instead find away to grow up your portfolio I was able to grow my through the help of Raymond Anthony Sammak which I have made about 10 btc lately  you can reach out via tele gram raymondsam01 be profitable,30,4

But the number one soultion to cryptos problems are education and risk management  People are told never invest your bread money which they do  They follow charts which are actually 80  useless and unreliable in my opinion  People are told do extensive adequate reasearch into teams and projects before investing which they dont  They go to youtube or fomo into things going parabolic  They invest in meme coins like doge or shib or nft platforms  They wont invest in things like medicine  energy  establishing financial systems in Africa e t c  People follow celebrities or other famous individuals based off of their opinions or trades or thoughts rather than simply going with their own thoughts and opinions  They have paper hands so extreme when a market is manipulated they dump ironically making the value go down even more  I dont feel pity for people who are blinded by greed and carelessness ,1,0

 Jack Mak How ,1,
All crypto are ponzi scams,5,
Iron was a ponzi scheme because it literally only had value while other people were flowing through the system  Its value never holds once the amount of people stagnates ,3,

It s crazy that the sheeple can easily accept a  65 000 digital air bitcoin  but laugh at a  10 000 price for a beautiful and useful physical assets that has been money for thousands of years  The dumbing down of society is incredible    Practically demonic   ,2,2

I love your confident attitude  It s refreshing to see an asian man that is a bit cocky and brash  People in the investment space  especially crypto need to hear your voice of reason and no nonsense attitude  Even though I m a crypto gambler  I subscribed to hear your voice of reason to keep me more grounded  Even though I m as sceptical as you are  I need to hear it frequently so I don t get carried away by voices such as Michael Saylor and Max Keiser  Keep speaking truth  facts  and REALITY  Thank YOU ,1,0
Not sure it s a good idea to help people learn about the scams being perpetrated through crypto  How else will cypto devs learn where its weaknesses are ,1,1

waiting for crypto saga to end,5,1
It will not end  The bubble will pop   as the dotcom one   and things will continue ,1,
Techlead at first I thought you were trolling with crypto videos at first and just milking the algorithm  But I genuinely have more respect for you as you make some genuine points in your video  even though I don t agree with you completely  The crypto fanboys haven t seemed to reported on the binance scams for example  I love crypto  but it s difficult to find balanced honest views  and so your channel helps accomplish that,34,1
I love crypto    And as a NON MILLIONAIRE  it s been wonderful,2,0

Awesome video as always  You talked about Jordan Peterson in last video I think  see his views in Jesus Christ and read the gospels especially the parables about thr greedy rich people  they take the time to collect money then they dont have happiness with it because they die for several reasons  So I wonder like you what is with people running after crypto which we all know that no government will use it since there is no central bank and no gold value for every unit of it  You have money to eat  live and having fun  you health is good  you dont have wars  so  live your life with no stress  I am saying this since in Iraq where I live we learnt to appreciate life because of deaths and all problems caused by terrorism and wars   ,1,1
Damn man  Crypto is all a scheme  Stock market is rigged  Time to focus on getting a real degree and becoming the best at my job  Thanks for the great awakening ,48,18
  A A I got a degree from Moscow State University in mass media propaganda   A troll factory hired me and my salary is  1000 month   Should I ask my boss for a raise   Or should I quit my job and start crypto mining   I currently have enough money to buy one graphics card ,1,
 Marzipug   That multiple trading technique may bite you in the behind one day   Old uncle Joe is planning on hiring and additional 80 000 IRS thugs   The old geezer knows revenue is slipping through his greedy fingers that he could be giving to other countries for kick backs later on   For each trade you do on the up side  you re technically supposed to be kicking some of that pork back to the Big Guy   The 10  figure is the family rate   Your end is closer to a 30  kickback ,2,
 Entropy137 yea I think 30 isn t to bad  I almost bought at 30k and would ve sold at 40k  Smh  We live and we learn  I don t think it will hit 0 neither  But I do believe in the future there will be heavy regulation and Bitcoin will be the only real crypto for the USA at least ,1,

 GOAT haha  that s funny but I don t think it will hit 0  I ve been buying at low 30s  I keep hearing the TA guys calling for 20k price but I don t think it will ,1,
 Entropy137 I m always right  Lol jk  I hope it hits 0 ,1,
 GOAT why are you so comfortable that it ll hit  24k ,1,
 grant terry if you hodl and you re not already very well off and don t have opportunity cost you are not choosing an optimal short term money making strategy  everyone should know this  ,1,
 Marzipug ain t that the truth  you sound just like crypto face  only noobs hodl,1,
 GOAT I don t  HODL  I trade  there s no way i ll be hodling through an 80  loss like you BTC fanboys  I ve been shorting since the first signs of reversal  just follow what the market gives you instead of wishing and hoping ,2,
 Marzipug no no  the only way to become a millionaire is to get a degree and work really hard so you can show your boss how much you deserve a raise ,14,
Crypto and stocks aren t rigged  your strategy is just unreliable ,8,
This sound like bitconnect     Look that up,1,1
  this many people dont HODL crypto,2,0
Unicorns don t need stables ,1,1
I generally haven t paid attention to crypto details or best practices  because I don t have a reason to hold it  At most  I suspect I d be buying small amounts like  100 of an arbitrary token that isn t BTC to send to someone who can t use PayPal or some other simpler option  e g  because they ve been deplatformed     Short of the US or Visa forcing me to use cryptocurrencies  either by rolling their own for me to use  or banning me from purchasing  banned products  with my credit card  I don t really see a use case that would force me into the crypto world any further than  sporadic donations to deplatformed creators    I think I m a pretty normal person in this regard   99  of people have no interest in your  hitcoins  whether it s BTC or something else  and nothing short of an unavoidable government or corporate mandate will get them to care  The only reason most people have bothered dipping their toes into the crypto world is because they re trying to win a  get rich quick  ponzi scheme game ,1,0
u just joined crypto this year bro    lol,2,1
Titan   Stick to the top 10 coins  split it over multiple addresses wallets  ensure those wallets have NEVER had a spend  then forget about it for 5 years and get on with life  BITCOIN and ETH only for the long hold  It s important you hold in a fresh wallet though  which is fine to have multiple receives  but must have NO SPENDS to ensure the public keys are not exposed on the blockchain   That s it  you have a safe cold storage wallet for your long haul BTC and ETH  Just hang onto it ,1,0
Thank you for a SLAP IN THE FACE MONENT  AMEN,11,1

Ya Herbal Life  Bernie Madoff  IRS Taxes Lehman Brothers  Dean Graziosi  Stratton Oakmont I could literally keep going on scams that use  USD Fiat Payments  Scams are not just limited to Crypto  that s like saying Crypto is only meant to buy drugs  I ve never seen someone not use USD for their illicit purchases  Darkweb is peanuts to overall drug transactions profits,2,

Coz noones wants to work anymore      ,3,
Sheeple mentality,3,
 Trajhenkhetlive it s a fake market really  if BTC tanks everything else does  The vibrant market is illusionary  You only need so many alternative currencies ,7,
It s an emerging market  It has value but there is a lot of danger if one is not mindful  A lot of newer coins seem sketchy and to be fair if you looked up how  stable  coins work you d realize that name is ironic,2,
It s fun   literally   sports betting  poker,6,

It is nice to see a channel that just craps on crypto all the time  makes a nice balance from the crypto pump channels    I like to get both sides  I m invested in crypto but mostly only the bigger ones like ETH ADA LINK DOT VET   Keep crapping on crypto TechLead because it gives me a nice balance of information   ,214,10
I love techlead taking dump  Refreshing  I alsp pref both sides ,1,
 The Accountant  They re violating the first and most important rule of investing  NEVER get emotionally attached    There should be no such thing as crypto fanboys  They are so emotionally attached that they re easily preyed on too  SOOOO many twitch thots are now pushing crypto ,4,
 Empnada Jhhh I agree  He makes very valid points that are well supported  and make me question my previous beliefs  It s good to have a variety of perspectives to put together the complete picture  PPL claiming its satire are just too involved in crypto and unwilling to listen to an opinion that opposes their own  and true investors should always be open to learning more information about their investments  even if it counters their existing beliefs  This is how you separate fact from fiction,8,
for real,3,
Sir this is kinda satire,2,

FUDlead   yeah  if you invest in penny stocks  certain commodities  futures  etc etc and don t do your research  you can lose your money  Crypto has advantages and disadvantages  don t invest in ANYTHING without doing research  If you don t have the time to do your research  but need to invest in something   invest in something safe like a nice stock EFT where you plan to hold it for 20 years ,3,0

I mean    don t buy trash tokens on illegitimate exchanges ,10,13
  T Chen Yeah  and the ETFs are holding companies  not coins  And that s for good reason  because the coins are basically a trash tier  investment   as they re more suitable for gambling or running a ponzi scheme ,1,
 OrdinaryHuman correct me if I m wrong  Most established brokerages only sell crypto ETF  not crypto coin,1,
 OrdinaryHuman but  paying a 4  fee  Seriously  the biggest exchange is Binance  right  Totally illegitimate,1,
Then you re left with what    using fiat money to buy legitimate assets like stocks  bonds  and real estate  Lol ,6,

 Matheus Barradas    Crypto is a very small part of my portfolio   I consider my small investment gambling money I m prepared to lose   A country that can ban the public from owning gold  Inter a group of people because of their race in WW2  and hold the January 6th peaceful protesters for months with no charges or bond  can illegalize the trading of all crypto currencies by the stroke of a pen ,1,
 Matheus Barradas I don t think you understand   Bernie Madoff s Ponzi went for 20 yrs   Trust with all the stable coins with  0 value it will ALL go to zero overnight   A money pyramid is fine  now crypto has become a ponzi scheme ,6,
