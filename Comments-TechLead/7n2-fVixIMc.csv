 This is my own conspiracy theory that I came up with on the fly  but those ransomware attacks could be staged by the government so that they can have an excuse to go after Bitcoin     Cryptocurrency is a threat to Modern Monetary Theory  If people see rampant       then they re going to turn to digital   ,5,

   I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate  digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally  its hard for for anyone going against them these days  though from a trader s perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies   lnvesttors on how the community works  crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come  lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy in the market and whether it isn t too late to buy an asset  when you re hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy  a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price  bulls or bears   I trade using signals from trade expert Mrs  Susan Bossmann with her guide and signal service i  ve made over 27B TC worth of crypto assets over some months  only for crypto inclined issues    connect her on               Susanbossmann ,213,1

You sound resentful but you shouldn t be  Even crypto trading is hard work  You need to spend countless hours researching all the coins  studying the markets for good entry and exit points  and keep up with a market that never sleeps and is going on 24x7  On top of that  you also have to endure extreme volatility and see your holdings drop by up to 70  even at times  and mustering up the strength to keep holding through such depressing lows where it feels like you ve lost all your money  losing your hair due to the extreme stress  and your claim about crypto traders being able to sleep is far from accurate  Don t assume things about others that you have no idea about  And even after going through all that pain  most crypto traders actually end up losing money  Think carefully about what I m saying here  Crypto traders have earned their money too ,1,1
By that logic  you only worked for few years and became millionaire  but most people work their whole life to become a millionaire  That s not fair  ,1,1

The crypto boom is pretty much over though right   I mean it seems like a trend that breaks out every 3 or 4 years   I doubt we will see any huge jumps again any time soon  overnight millionaire levels at least  lol ,1,1
So basically you re butthurt that earlier investors that made millions made it easier than you  Lmao  Side note  Those people actually didn t buy and hold and become millionaires overnight  They had to wait and deal with violent price volatility for months years    Get out of your feelings  College grad with a full time and part time job who is also pursing their masters degree talking here   oh and I m also in crypto    lol ,1,2

Can someone explain why Crypto fanboys expect crypto to replace fiat currency when all they do with it is speculate on the  asset  and value it against fiat currency  How can you expect this to replace the dollar if you value it against the dollar and are so quick to cash out back into USD when it starts to fall  People treat Crypto like digital gold  not an actual currency ,4,2
That s because all they know is bitcoin  a d Bitcoin s pricing system works just like gold  Not all cryptos exist only for speculation  Ethereum let s banks trade nearly 4x as fast,1,
hey man work smarter not harder  its good if someone becomes a millionare overnight because they did the work and chose the right investment  even if they were just gambling they did the work to be at the right place at the right time though if they keep gambling theyll probably get blown to bits eventually   investing is definetely risky  its like gambling except you must improve your chances of success to far above 50   hopefully  by researching and preparing for the worst etc  if you work hard at anything for a long time its likely to improve your chances of success  its like there is a trade off between doing a little work and having higher risk vs  doing alot of work and having lower risk   its possible bitcoin may be heading up soon  if you draw trendlines you can get a downward wedge with the recent movements which often leads to an upside breakout  its already broken out depending how its drawn  its possible that it is a flatbottomed triangle too though which often leads to a selloff so i would definitely be careful and form your own opinions about it ,1,0
hahahaha this guy wouldnt know a hard days work if it hit him in the face  did he just say he lives at home with his parents lmao if you just have cash and no hard assets like a home I don t think you re doing that well bud,1,1

guy who quit work to make youtube videos complains about how other people don t want to work     and actually  bitcoin is another thing that solves this  people would be much more willing to work if they thought knew that the money they made could actually help get them somewhere in life  which bitcoin does because it preserves it s spending power over the long term  whereas cash does not because it loses 10   of it s spending power for important things like housing every year ,1,1

Regardless of whether you agree with his sentiment or not  studies show that people who have no purpose or direction fall into depression  It happens often with folks who reach retirement  I can understand not wanting to be part of the rat race but if they don t substitute the rat race for some other meaningful purpose that gives their life direction and goals of some sort  they will likely not be able to sustain their happiness even if they become a crypto millionaire ,19,2

Love how often your posting Content my dude  Thanks for the insights n sharing  ,1,1
The thing is techlead could become a millionaire by working hard bc he probably he has high IQ and is very smart but if you arent way above average intelligence you got no chance in our hyper competitive world  there are more and more people and especially high paying jobs are really rare and as a normal person it is nearly impossible to get a job at a firm like facebook  So you are forced to work your hole life in some shitty minimum wage job  just to not become homeless ,5,1
Very good philosophy from Tech Lead,1,2

The problem is the manipulation  The manipulators wanted a quick double and accidentally took the market down to far  I don t think they realized the damage they would do by being extra greedy and dumping too much  They took it down a bit to far and that spooked out the market   They were expecting the normal V shape recovery but you can only do so much of that before it spooks off buyers ,2,0

 Crazy prayingmantis I planned on shorting it at 64 000 but missed my chance because it went straight down  Hopefully  I get another  I doubt it  That was the all time high ,1,
We still have the problem of when bitcoin goes to zero Salvadorians will have no money  But the IMF will help out I am sure ,1,
 aries prince They will have the option to use government wallet  or their own  It will be their choice and its a step in the right direction ,1,
Strike solves this  There are videos already on YouTube of Salvadorans paying groceries at supermarkets with Bitcoin  Instant transactions  The lightning network works ,3,
They started using btc last year in a small village using lightning network  fast transactions,1,
I m hearing news that the transactions would be happening on the lightning network    will make btc payment processing faster   but it s going to be through a government custodial wallet issued  by the state  which leads back to a centralization situation since the users wont have access to the wallet Adress  keys as  it technically belongs to the government  that s not freedom imo    that s deception in plain sight  ,3,
This is where litecoin is superior  because its bitcoin but faster for smaller purchases that don t require Fort Knox security and time to secure as a payment    litecoin is invented and MIT licenses for these reasons   lawl at you  for being behind the train and bashing on bitcoin ,1,

I agree with you  as a GTA Online milionaire ,456,14
 Just Chill That depends how u measure work  I m pretty sure the amount of time energy a donkey puts in its work in a day is much more than a human  just like the amount of time energy people like Techlead puts in is more when compared to a Bitcoin millionaire    If one wish to argue that people like Techlead are smarter luckier than donkeys   can get more better results then it can also be argued that Bitcoin millionaires are smarter than people like Techlead   got more better results than him   Looks like money is still very very important compare to hammers  unless it s one of a kind like Mjolnir   Better to get keep more money than hammers ,2,
Statement 1  Most Bitcoin millionaires got rich without working as hard as people like Techlead thus it s  good fair  if they lose money or go poor bankrupt   Statement 2  Money  like hammers   doesn t solve all of life s problem thus it s better to not get a lot of money   Counter 1  Most people like Techlead got rich without working as hard as animals like donkeys thus it s  good fair  if they lose money or go poor bankrupt   Counter 2  If so why don t all rich people just give throw all their money away ,2,

 Ryan Brubacher you dont need to  understand  BTC  whatever that means  since it s always used as shifting goal post  to understand that govt controls the exchanges  Without a reliable way to exchange your BTC for anything tangible  you know how much it s worth  Take a guess   yea  thats   nothing ,1,
 Ryan Brubacher In the current volatile market a lot of country s and corps are dabbling in it  potential for easy money  The infrastructure of it will never be a global accepted replacement unless Gov t can track all aspects  which they control every businesses payroll taxes  network lines etc   If that becomes the new norm  The Gov t will know everything you ve ever bought or spent currency on       which would be significantly more taxes for you  which is why Gov ts are working towards that   There is no avoiding it ,1,

 Ryan Alex That s a poor example  Welfare is there to support the poor so they don t starve and not to make them rich  If it made people rich  everybody would drop their 3 min wage job and get rich so they could live by investing money into bubbles ,2,
 Ryan Alex My grandpa has already done that before internet existed  He works very very hard but never feels he is rich enough to retire  He had a very hard tough life as a farmer so he hopes his future generations can work wiser smarter  makes more money  or find get a Cash cow   have more time for health family   or gets better results returns ,1,
 Ryan Alex Absolutely  But forcing making people to decide between Starvation or Exploitation  aka Slavery  isn t a great solution either ,5,
Statement 1  Most Bitcoin millionaires got rich without working as hard as people like Techlead thus it s  good fair  if they lose money or go poor bankrupt   Counter 1  Most people like Techlead got rich without working as hard as animals like donkeys thus it s  good fair  if they lose money or go poor bankrupt   Statement 2  Money  like hammers   doesn t solve all of life s problem thus it s better to not get a lot of money   Counter 2  If so why don t all the  rich  people just give throw most of their money away ,4,
