I remember when I just got into crypto back in 2017 but later in 2018 I ended up selling it because I was dumb and I didn t understand it  I studied and learned and now I know how it works  Got back into crypto early in 2021 and looks like we have the same mentality  I admit that seeing a  50  hurts but it s not a realized loss until you sell  Now   I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 23  btc from day trading with Medz Signal in few weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish He is a professional crypto analyst mentioned by most youtubers for his great signals And medz works with newbies beginner  advanced and professionals I tool invest and holds stocks but trust me for i have seen much more differences unlike the crypto world Medz can be reached via telegram  Medzfolio,779,0

Using GNU Linux as your main OS really isn t as hard as you think it is  Just install Mint or Manjaro with Cinnamon  windows like desktop  or KDE  MacOS like desktop  on one of your old laptops and try it  If a dumbass from the internet like myself can figure it out  I m sure you can ,1,0

This video truly  just made my day   However  I was surprised you had been using a laptop and not an iMac Pro for editing since of course  for yourself money is not an issue   Also  when you stated your reason number five for going back to an Apple computer from Windows  I stared to laugh so very hard  In addition  your statement  and oh by the way  I had to buy their stock too  was  just priceless  smile   smile  ,3,1

I switched to Mac as a lifetime e windows user  I then decided to switch my whole ecosystem over and I ve never been happier  The iPad Pro is by far my favourite device I ve ever used  I especially love that my new AirPods Pro auto switch devices  I still have a gaming pc  but windows just doesn t feel as smooth or fast as Mac OS  on 10 or 11   Im a photographer  cinematographer  video editor  etc ,3,0

Complete opposite of everything  I experience as pro who came to m1 max from all windows whole life    1  All keybind completely broken for me  and I use software to change it 2  finder is just a piece of bad software compared to windows file hierarchy 3  no programs  nothing about deepfake  deep learning  Neuro  and professional little software for various scenarios created for niche  like SEO  SMM  there is just no of them on Mac os  4  if there would be no Google Chrome on Mac os  it would completely unusable for everyone who is  pro   with high APM 5  this childish animations of UI is for newbies  and slows workflow  disabled everything at first  6  screen and battery is awesome by the way  If you love windows and used to it   never try to switch on Mac  go for Nvidia RTX one s  like Asus Zephyrus  Selling my maxed out m1 max 14  for it right now  windows is just superior in every term  instead of privacy and malware protection in cost of everything  by the way same thing with IOS and Android ,5,0

These new M1 chips seem really good  I ll probably wait until M2 to jump back over to Macs though  Hopefully some of the higher end M1 tech will trickle down to the entry mid level M2s ,5,6
Windows are for apex legends  Macs are for making moola     ,1,1
I enjoyed TechLead s vid and could not agree more  I  bought my wife a new MBP for Christmas and can t get her off it    she loves it  The M1 chip is very fast and we ve not run into any difficulties with any software designed for Intel based machines  Everything runs great  Full disclosure  I made the switch a number of years back from Microsoft to Mac and have never looked back  I  am not anti Windows    I started off with DOS 2 1 back in the days and stuck with MS for decades  It s just that Apple seems to make things  that are intuitive to use and they just work ,2,1

Windows doesn t force you to install unverified apps  you do it to yourself  Blaming windows for viruses that you install is dumb ,6,2
Yeah it depends upon the user  if the user is smart you won t get any virus in windows,1,
laptop sucks  build a pc  learn about hardware  enjoy the performance and longevity,1,1
However for many developers M1 is just a PITA because we use non M1  Intel  architecture virtual machine images that will run dog slow and probably not well in any kind of emulation environment ,1,1
Lower spec than I expected from the tech lead   considering it s a business expense I thought he would ve just maxed it out  ,1,1

I use windows and I m really getting tired of the inconsistency  bugs  driver problems and annoying updates that happen on a daily basis  I m definitely going to get a mac when I have the money,16,14
Get a mac mini,1,
 Arya Sheikhi Like what software  There is always alternative for software  VPN can be replaced with Tor which is better  I m not saying that you must switch to Linux  Its just a thought ,1,
 QuantumSupremacy but you gotta admit mac is much more stable and resource friendly Things like windows management are more like things to get used to rather than absolute headaches,1,
There is always Linux that you can try  Just pick a popular one ,2,
 QuantumSupremacy whatever floats your boat,3,
 CostaCoffee 4life I made the switch and kind of regret it  I ve found Mac s window management to be super difficult to work with  especially with multiple monitors  Also multiple browser windows open there is no way to easily go to which one you want  Windows is much easier in this regard ,2,
You won t regret it  If nothing else  you will appreciate not having a  problem with you PC  everyday ,1,
I also got a 14 inch m1 Pro MacBook Pro and a ASUS Zenbook 14 with a dual touchscreen  MX450 graphics ,1,1
So here are the flaws with your observations  First of all  Windows 11 is a more secure version of Windows than before  and this is why eventually this year I will upgrade to it  Second  the so called blue screens of death people claim to get is not the fault of the operating system per say  but mostly their inability to upgrade to the recommended  and actually necessary hardware configurations  including at least an Intel 8th gen CPU or AMD series 400 CPU or above  Also  making sure you are using your computer is a proper manner  keeping it maintained and upgraded in the operating system  firmware  BIOS  and overall computer drivers  It is not hard  You should also enable TPM 2 0 and Secure Boot in BIOS as mandatory defaults  Plus  I use Core Isolation Protection for the hardware memory and ransomware protection    Remember  ALL computers connect to the SAME internet  I have been using Windows since version 3 11  and the only version I did not use was ME  for obvious reasons  You may have worked for Google and Facebook  and may have a lot of money  but that does not mean you know or understand everything  Sometimes  people can be their own worst enemy  You can use Adguard as a premium or in your browsers for great ad blocking and extra malware protection overall  Even a simple program called UnHackMe checks all boot up files  etc and acts in this same manner  You will be fine    Using Apple does not mean you are more secure  The same goes for Linux  They can all be hacked  The point of security and being up to date is in the user s hands   And you can use Windows for both gaming and productivity  That is the point  Apple is overpriced and proprietary  You can also use a desktop with regular keyboards  Most laptops have horrible keyboards  too mushy  no click or tactile feedback  and they are not best for what most people want to do with computing  Cooling also an issue with laptops  no matter how good or expensive they claim to be  or are  That is all I will say about this ,1,0

I have just switched to Mac for the first time  I got annoyed with Windows operating systems getting worse for each one they released since XP and all the drivers issues and other problems  I have bought a MacBook Pro 16  M1 Pro with 1TB  It should hopefully arrive next week ,27,5
 Kappamomondo i ve bought maxed out m1 max 14 and after a month now  going to sell it   unusable after windows,1,
Yeah  life long Windows user here also about to make the switch  It s becoming quite difficult to justify Windows these days,2,
I feel like this happens to everyone who switches from a Mac to a Windows PC  It s only a matter of time before they switch back again ,1,2
Great content as always  Have you ever thought about installing parallels on a mac to install windows and also to play pc games   What are your thoughts on it   I m tempted to try it out ,2,3
It should be powerful enough to do tht  idk how the graphics portion would function  tho for demanding games  ,1,
Have you considered using a desktop   It s way better for things like gaming and video editing ,1,1
I agree  Actually  this is the FIRST good Apple laptop since     2015  Like you said    they removed useless touchbar   nobody uses it   they added ports  so your Apple laptop won t a dongle   adapter joke  it was for last hmm 7 years    they fixed keyboard  at my work  at software house  like 20 30   of devs have command button that simply can be detached from the keyboard xDDD    I have Macbook Pro 2015  and yes  it is getting really slow  but the truth is   any other laptops by Apple had so much more flaws than these three  badly designed   very thin package   throttling  or low quality components leading to ie  screen issues   that it wasn t worth to  upgrade   And yea  even if i don t like windows  for software development   then 2 3 years ago  Windows laptops were simply just better ,13,1

I almost choked to death on hearing  life isn t just about playing games    I was eating   Here we are witnessing another monumental moment of TechLead switching to TechDad and sharing his wisdom once again lmao,105,5
 Cautious X0 kk  Looking back at my comment  which I only vaguely remember now   idk why I was being so defensive about gaming    I have not been exposed to playing games very much growing up  and have in the past couple of years played some amazing RPGs  The stories are fascinating  and it s just like reading a book but it s played out in front of you    But yeah I totally agree that if gaming slowly becomes a means of procrastination and it starts to influence your life in a bad way more than it should  yeah ur right one s in big trouble ,3,
 Kevin Xin I think he meant that most people spend such a massive amount of time on gaming that the opportunity cost is rather high  Also those other activities you mentioned are usually for shorter bursts of time than gaming  Honestly  an hour or two of gaming is fine  But 5  8  That s just not effective,2,
  Venemies Tech Depends on why you game tho  You could say that to any form of entertainment  Watching movies is a waste of time cuz I could have gotten work done  Going surfing  skateboarding anything that is not working is taking up actual time that could be used for working  Watching Youtube as well    There is nothing wrong to spend time on playing games it s all just a matter of balance and why you are playing them ,3,
Gaming is mostly a waste of Time imo   It s fun but I d rather get something real done,2,
Your comment is so good you attracted a phishing bot,1,
I have a friend who has an iMac with an i7 proc and 32G RAM  He can t install his preferred music software because Mac will no longer allow him to update his OS  Great company  ,21,3
this guy got paid to  switch sides   everyone knows apple is overhyped shiz,3,
 Karim Amrane The fact is that his computer was only 6 years old and still better spec wise than the majority of people are buying today  yes  even if his i7 isn t latest gen   The reason I invest in a great system is so that I don t have to upgrade often  My PC is long in 11 years old  it was a baller system when I bought it and it still works great  I d be PISSED if I spend what he did and then was told it was outdated and obsolete 6 years later  Not to mention the horrible environmental ramifications of this type of practice,4,
There is an i7 processor and i7 processor  First i7 processor were in 2009 iMacs  so if Apple won t allow him to update  it means he has an old PC not supporting the latest software  It s a better approach than Windows  because Apple guarantees reliability and functioning which is the staple of their brand  Simply put  they won t allow you to update because it would be slow  and not worthy   ,1,
 This   season   has   been   really   great      I ve   been   making   massive   returns   on   my   crypto   investment   all   thanks   to   my   expert   David   Carter  ,8,12
Apple is for idiots   I realized that after 10 years wanting to have the Apple eco system  and finally when I bought a iPhone  Apple Watch  Macbook Pro M1  and air pods  I understood that you can do these days the same thing with other brands  like Asus Gaming notebooks  Samsung eco systerm  costing less then half of the money ,2,2
Exactly  These people in the comments are living in the past  saying M1 has better performance than any chip out there  ADL has the performance crown for now ,1,
Thanks for watching       Don t forget to push the subscription button for consulation and investment advice  on how to invest  ,1,

Nice review  Hopefully I will upgrade from my 13 inch MacBook pro this year  It has limited ports  2 type C  and the screen is just too small for me ,4,2
You are funny but serious  its great   The stuff you think about all at once  crack me up    Me I don t like Apple I find it restrictive  but i m not a gamer or a techlead  or a millionaire  ,2,1
Apple M1 is great in terms of power efficiency and stuff like video editing  Intel has been a lost cause for a while in terms of both performance and power efficiency  I think that Apple really needs eGPU support and Valve really should consider getting Proton up and running on OSX before I consider using one  Apple really killed off any gaming support on OSX by getting rid of support for x86 binaries and not offering any sort of compatibility layer for those kinds of applications   I definitely do think though that while Apple going with ARM based hardware is a plus  it s really handicapped by Windows not being available natively  and by the fact that repairing those are going to be increasingly difficult   I m personally tired of Windows and it s driver and stability issues  on top of high DPC latency spikes on NVIDIA GPUs   so I ve been daily driving Fedora Kinoite with Latte Dock  No issues so far outside of maybe not having full fat Visual Studio support for cross compiling Windows binaries without a virtual machine ,6,2
Love how he includes  as a millionaire   just to remind us of the difference in our tax brackets,62,1
Nice quote  This video sponsored by Apple   hehe    TechLead watchout when you discover old great dos games     Still i think to use mac   is just when you need to deploy apps directly to Applestore   so multiplatform then       TechLead now you start to collect different type of hardware  which actually the most natural level ,1,1
Love your channel  What book would you recommend for someone who wants to learn code  Thanks,1,1
You fool  as a millionaire   I  as a millionaire  knew you d be back  Windows is disgusting ,1,1

Windows 10 and 11 are incredibly slow   making today s PC worse than 10 years ago  even on gaming machine  It is very sad that Windows developer this days have no idea how to do simple file open dialog  Opening folder with 1200 pictures takes 4 seconds and then 10 seconds more of scratching disk to sort them according to date   every time  although sorting has been set a year ago  Even pressing Windows button sometimes takes few seconds for star menu to appear  Very sad facts  Not to mention that few brand new HP laptops with Wn10   intended just for basic office work  head disk usage at 100  most of the time  making them barely usable so I ve returned them ,4,0
Finally some tech content  ,1,1
6 months later   Why I am switching back to Mac   He knows we forgot what he was using ,1,1
Same here I use a MBA M1 for productivity and a desktop windows i9 rtx3070 for diablo 2 resurrection and Oculus quest2 games  The minute Apple can run AAA games i will sell these windows crap hardware  ,1,1
I bought my first mac  m1 air  this summer and I  m very pleased with the performance and quality of the laptop  I also downloaded parallels so I can run windows and play my steam games  The two best features imo are that there s no fans so it never gets loud and the battery can run 10  hours with a single quick charge even when gaming ,9,9
 Victor Mutta I ve played valheim  skyrim  AC2  civilization 6 some of which are old games and have macOS port  but I haven t experienced compatibility issues  I should also mention I have the 16gb ram version ,1,
 E A Yea I do  I m an engineering student and it can run all my CAD and CFD simulation software without issues ,1,
What games do you play on Parallels  Hear of a lot of compatibility issues ,1,
Do you still recommend the macbook air m1 chip  specially for someone who s looking for first laptop  And can you run most of the important apps  softwares on it ,1,
Ugh   I was so ready to leave Apple then you post this   My 2017 MBP has been alright but that ASUS ROG Laptop you have looks so good ,2,1
2016 2020 MacBooks are bad  it was the dark ages for Apple  2021 MacBooks   iMacs are back and absolutely worth it ,1,
I mean I guess if your whole focus is making youtube videos and tiktok  Apple has some appeal for those people  As a design professional however  and a millionaire  I can t bring myself to use children s toys for development  If I were to switch to Mac  I would be forced to use Bootcamp and other emulators to get actual work done on PC software  so what s the point  Maybe Windows 11 sucks  that s entirely possible  but that s the nice thing about PC software is that you re not forced to upgrade and you re not forced into a tiny cubby hole where your creative workflow is stymied by the crushing weight of the Apple infrastructure  So I m not hating on Apple  they re an incredibly successful marketing company and have a cult like following of mostly aging baby boomers who don t really understand what computers do and what they re for in a professional setting  They make products that are so simple to use  that literal babies can navigate say an iPad and have a decent user experience  And I really appreciate the fan service and back peddling of bringing back the headphone jack and all the user ports that were deleted in previous releases  That makes a lot of sense  M1 chip  Awesome hardware  and definitely necessary because it will be working through several emulation layers to get actual work done    ,7,1
I would probably get a Mac instead of a personal computer,1,0
Is that a low profile mechanical keyboard  If so I want one ,1,1
  If you don t have money  then your problem isn t money  your problem is not knowing what to do      Sir TechLead,317,3

 Rafael Nogueira Samsung is awful when it comes to user experience  and they like to put  gimmicks  on their devices  Bad features that only look good on the ads  but when people buy the phones  nobody uses it,1,
 Raphael Martins I know that  I agree  but I think is more healthier and open to the user at this point  I don t use the Samsung apps besides the mail client app  but I think is more healthier for the user  to just use Android at this point   than the golden jail from Apple    ,3,
 Rafael Nogueira Samsung ecosystem is not even close to the Apple ecosystem ,12,
I realized that after 10 years wanting to have the Apple eco system  and finally when I bought a iPhone  Apple Watch  Macbook Pro M1  and air pods  I understood that you can do these days the same thing with other brands  like Asus Gaming notebooks  Samsung eco systerm  costing less then half of the money   2022 CES  AMD launched mobile CPUS basically with more perfomance then M1 having the same  battery  time,7,

The PRO is back  I switched as well  just picked up the new MacBook Pro M1 and it is laptop perfection  The machine is very fast  The screen is gorgeous   Video editing is a amazing on the new M1 SoC  The feature that I like that best is the SOUND  it is like a mini stereo     Also  give SIDECAR a try  you can tether an iPad pro and use it as a touch screen   An the new keyboard  magsafe  and ports are a nice touch   Someone said only Apple could create a problem then make their customers buy the fix   BTW   I settled on the 14   the 16  was just too big ,30,1
I pick the best device for the job    Gaming   Windows  but I don t game anymore    Mac   Ease or creative work    iPad   couch web surfing  Fedora Linux   Software Development ,3,1

 Dan Sol s I m pretty sure you can run anything not native under emulation in Rosetta or if necessary in Parallels   I saw a video where they got better performance with Windows on an M1 compared to Windows on a native Windows laptop ,1,

When they killed off Win 7 and introduced that  atrocious Win 8  I went ahead and gave Mac a chance  Haven t looked back since ,11,1
I m a PC gamer so i m sticking with PC obviously but as a graphic designer i ve always used imacs and since this is what the office provide I feel like i ll always work with an imac  I get mad at it from time to time  but then I remind myself that all my problems come from Adobe and not MacOS lol  I m staying away from W11 for a few years though ,2,1
A few months later   Why I switched back back to Windows ,1,1
Personally I can t stand working on MacOS  PC  3 ,1,1
There was an upgrade of GFN with power of rtx 3080 recently  so you dont really need Windows pc now with such force of cloud gaming  Saying that I have powerful desktop i9 10850k with rtx 3090 for gaming  but my Windows notebook I will switch for 16 pro mac for work  productivity and studying development  And will just use GFN in case  New MacBooks are amazing machines ,1,3
I m using the GeForce now 3080 plan with a Mac but it really needs an excellent Ethernet connection to work otherwise there ll be a lot of stutters  Also there s unavoidable input lag even if ur using gigabit Ethernet  I tried using it on a 30mbps hotel Wi Fi and well  it sucks  The resolution will often drop below 240p and ur basically playing with a toaster,1,
I can understand from a security point of view wanting to put yourself in a walled garden  Personally i own nothing apple  find them too to restrictive  Prefer maximum performance desktop in airflow case  overclocked and water cooled  over being in apples pocket with their planned obsolescence and poor part choices ,4,3
Security is the worst reason to consider a walled garden  Good or bad security depends on the implementation of the security system  It doesn t matter if it s open source  closed  or doesn t let you touch your computer  By design  a security method should work even if you know how it works and even if you try to mess with it  Apple just use security as an excuse for monopolistic control over software  The purpose is securing the 30  cut and ability to delete downgrade SEO of competitors in their store if they need to ,4,

Finally  I was waiting for the Techlead to showcase the new MacBooks  I d like more details and differences on macOS on arm vs windows for programmers comp sci students  In general more student content and point of views would be highly appreciated ,42,6
 Artyom Palvelev  Linux fanboys are so insecure,6,
If you re a student  a mac is not worth it  Get a sub 500usd used laptop and run your favorite linux distro  If you re new to linux then just run ubuntu  You can always switch distros later on when you learn what you like dislike  If your laptop is you only device then you should dual boot windows and linux  If you re fortunate enough to also have a desktop as a student  then no need to dual boot on the laptop since you ll probably already be running windows on your pc   Mac really is never worth the money unless you really NEED to utilize anything that mac excels at,3,
The most important detail that you need to know as a programmer is  Linux outruns them all,2,
100  that would be so useful  ,1,
3 32 Actually in 2019 the average Mac faced more malware attacks than the average PC did  for the first time ever,21,4
 Daniel Andersson Windows has gotten way better in regards to malware  not arguing that  But there are many more vectors for malware targeting PCs  I work in IT support and 100  of our malware infections are on our PCs  have had none on our Macs  If there s a report that shows Mac having more malware than PCs I d like to see it and how they got their metrics,2,

Updated to Win11 was constantly overheating my laptop  i7 32GB RAM but no dedicated GPU   You really need to download and monitor your cores heat or you wouldn t know Win11 is burning everything out  What was great was that when I reinstalled Win10 it FINALLY resolved a Wifi disconnect error that had plagued my laptop since the 1901 update  disconnected like 5 times a day   So  that is fixed and I m so grateful to Win11 for sucking  it carried the error over with the update  so bad that I reinstalled Win10 for the millionth time and inadvertently something changed and the Wifi error was fixed  Thank God ,3,0
2022 will now be the year I buy a apple something   maybe mini  So true about verified apps and the performance of the M1 chip  Thanks,178,8
For your first  Apple something  purchase  start off by buying the Apple Pro Stand   Believe me  it will be the BEST  999 that you will ever spend       ,6,
I bought a Mini in 2010 for iMovie   GarageBand   The hardware still works  but the OS is out of date  so I picked up a base M1 Mini on sale at Costco for  570 before Christmas   I don t game  but the biggest downside currently for me is the difficulty in running old x86 VM s   I use Windows  Mac   Linux ,2,
I realized that after 10 years wanting to have the Apple eco system  and finally when I bought a iPhone  Apple Watch  Macbook Pro M1  and air pods  I understood that you can do these days the same thing with other brands  like Asus Gaming notebooks  Samsung eco systerm  costing less then half of the money ,5,
 What App             nah,8,
Cracks me up how confidently you flip flop  But case in point  that just means you re not a fanboy  You re just going with what you see as the optimal use case for you in the moment  Maybe Microsoft should up its game now ,25,1
He got paid by Asus  That s the end lol,1,
Lmao  here is another flip flop  Few months ago trashing Mac saying windows is superior and he ll never go back  This is exactly like his takes on crypto and trashing cardano and eth  Give it a few months and he ll start shilling them again  Love his technical videos but take what he says with a grain of salt ,1,0

I chose a Windows machine for work  a  2800 spec from Dell  and despise it  Not sure if it s Windows or the hardware  or both   but the machine  a Dell XPS  behaves like a piece of crap  My 2015 MacBook Pro is much more enjoyable to use  although I recognize that Apple is also going backwards on software as they get better at hardware ,40,21
This is so annoying  I used to be called an Apple fanboy  and then I started to look at tech more broadly  See if there was anything good in PC land  but it seems even when you spend 1000s in PC land  you still get issues    thermal issues   high power consumption   problems opening files   loud fans,1,
 Phantom You need to create a custom fan profile in the UEFI BIOS  All the stock profiles are trash  If you have a good cooler the fans don t need to ramp up that much ,1,
 Stupid Flanders fan going nuts might be a dell exclusive thing IMO my mom had a dell latitude and it d sound like an aircraft carrier when it s sleeping my hp and the family thinkpad never has this issue,1,
The laptop is less than a year old  and pretty well reviewed  Dell XPS 15   It was spinning up its fans from the beginning  even when the laptop was left alone for hours to do absolutely nothing   and that s how I learned that Windows 10 no longer really has a sleep mode that lets the machine take a break  which seems like an incredibly dumb trade off just for a faster start up from Sleep  It also means I take a huge gamble that my backpack will be on fire whenever I throw the laptop in there without telling it to Hibernate first  I ve taken it out from my backpack before and it was so hot I could barely touch it  or it used up all its battery and shut off completely before I got to it    I was holding out some hope that it would get better as Windows finished whatever indexing it does early on  or that a software update  of which I got several for the Bios in the first few weeks I had it  would fix things  I ve been tempted to ask Dell for help but am really dreading that customer service experience  and certainly couldn t afford  productivity wise  to send my machine to them without getting a replacement first ,1,
 Stupid Flanders me  doing nothing on the computer  writing stuff on paper   my MacBook   quiet    my ThinkPad  lul Microsoft defender go reeeeeeee,2,
You have to change the performance settings to high so it uses the power of the CPU and GPU,1,
I m tempted to do something like that but it s a work machine with a bunch of different installed by my employer s IT department  It s a hassle  but it might be worth the productivity loss and frustration I m accepting otherwise ,1,
 Stupid Flanders I would give it a final shot and format the machine  than if this problems keep happening  just seel it and go back to mac  Whatever is functional and keeps your work flow  thats the way to go ,3,
I should ve mentioned but I ve only been using Windows 10 on that machine    The fan is almost constantly on at an unreasonably high speed  despite CPU usage being  10  and the laptop being on a desk   even while it s in Sleep mode  Excel freezes once I have more than  6 files open concurrently  even though  again  CPU usage is low   and the OS seems to stumble over itself frequently if I m using a few different typical apps  which my much lower spec Mac handles without stuttering  So I m very tempted to blame it all on Windows and swear off PCs if I have a choice ,6,
