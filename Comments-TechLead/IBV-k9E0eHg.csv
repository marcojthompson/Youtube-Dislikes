Yo  tech lead  get rid of the bots on your comments sections and spammers  Is better to get it more tidy since is your personal YouTube channel  is the least you could do  if YouTube or Google do not take care of the issues  Do a bit of sweep and report for goodnes sake ,1,
What a shame that you are sponsored by anybody these days ,9,
MM at 2 bucks is great news     ,1,
Even with the return dislike feature  this video almost has as many dislikes as likes  btw the extension is showing values that are way less than they would be before the removal   Goes to show just how hated he is now  Edit  oh also  MuLtI MiLlIoNaIrE ApP eNtRePenEUr,1,2
I love crypto  but Exchamges like Coinbase  charge criminally exorbitant fees to buy Crypto and place restrictions on the amount customers can withdraw or even deposit  Plus they enforce intrusive KYC  Coinbase is just like my goddam bank  So where can I trade move my crypto without restriction Mr  TechLead ,1,1
its hilarious how this channel started with some hot takes about the programming career  working for big tech companies  etc and is now pumping crypto scams and complaining about his ex wife in public lmao,4,2
Making fun of a guy making money from an actual tangible product while you pulled the rug on your viewers     Scaaaaaaaaaaamer,2,2
Scamer,1,0
Bro you pulled the race card on him  Im sorry i lost respect for you then  He doesnt need to know how to code to have an opinion  He isnt wrong  Scams often are profitable ,1,0

How million token doing     ,1,0
Maybe your million token is irrelevant     ,3,0
Man you re just a joke channel now      ,1,0
 Jason Song Techlead knows what he s talking about  He has a better reputation than most ,1,
Is someone born now   without a cryptofolio  a stupid late adopter  If you play monopoly but don t get any start money  will you win  Does TechLead really understand  or is he just a greedy opportunist  Does a hyena understand the circle of life  These are all rhetorical questions   that means  any answers are immaterial  ,1,2
Close your channel dude  You ve lost all credibility  You use to have a pretty neat channel for what coding is concerned  You put your rep on the line and the line snapped,2,2
1 17 million Subs but less than 60k views    FAKE SUBS,4,3
Ohh TechLead  You ve lost me mate  You were the outlier  Now you re just one of them  Crypto IS dumb  Crypto tech IS not unique  Case in point  New coins appearing each day   You can start your own coins by downloading repos on GIT  Do a search  Also White papers are toilet paper  Fact is this  Crypto is a way for influencers and billionaires to manipulate a market where they win and everyone loses WITHOUT regulatory oversight  under the thin veil of  amazing tech   Basically a wild west casino  Fact is 99  of the population have no idea and obviously lap it all up  Fml       ,1,1
0 50 You can t wear crypto,1,2
You was not in jail ,1,2
10 secconds in and this man is already unbearable ,5,2
If you buy meme coins you are stupid   Buying the 30th dog coin like it s going to make it,1,1
What a tool ,1,1
Gambling  games on the blockchain is an epic buy  You should do your research  buy now on those less than penny stocks and go long ,2,2
With 15k you can have 20 50 dollars allocation and we can make More as x20 or x30  and Don t forget this month for exemple is 10 ido and a very big ido when you make in every ido 500 dollars in ein month you refund your investissement,1,2
Thank you for educating me on this topic  I bought some Ethereum and Polkadot a week ago ,1,2
Crypto market especially defi  is doing the same thing banks have done forever ,1,2
Just found your channel yesterday   Very useful information   I had to stay up for 2 nights without sleep to figure out to by crypto   I started talking about it in October and all the tokens I was researching had 5x d before I could figure out how to buy them   Any how found some new tokens to invest in and staked some as well    Most people are clueless about this stuff   Luckily I quit my job and had enough time to figure it all out before crypto goes hyperbolic   Funny how yhe whales control the media to bring the crypto down so they can get in at the price they want   It just helps the people who are slower to get to the table   Looking forward to the next two months   I have worked hard my whole life   Time to reap some rewards ,1,1
Next youtube will remove the thumbs up button  after that they will remove the comment section ,1,2
Rent Free,1,2
still beating this dead horse  you should be working on applying to new jobs  as a failed millionaire ,1,2
I am 24 and just don t have the money to invest,1,2
is blockchain technology worth learning  I heard yuo once said that blockchain is only valuable for crypto  Do you still keep the same opinion ,2,2
So basically that is your only thing against Coffezilla  that he is selling t shirts and not pumping crypto  Man  you re as low as you re smart ,10,2
Question how do you establish trust in a completely decentralised environment  There has to be at least some basic ground rules ,1,2
Are you still trying to milk coffee for views  Sad ,1,2
2051  people finally legalize and make a peaceful way to have the best night of their life and the best sleep and that s it  and no more suturing at the last moments of their life  for there  you will not care about anything  you will just writhe in the thrall of death and will wish you were never born  never existed  and with you had a peaceful way to go  but you survived  and realize the whole world of wine who had ever existed is in for that  but you should have been dead 13 times maybe   prime are in for the wrist moments they never imagined at the end of their life when they should be making their bed nice now  you all have no idea what death is  but everyone will either suffer or party instead  were in 2021  you can watch YouTube travel with maps  listen to music was you bike  but go in a peaceful easy when you want  45 to 65 percent of the planet would leave now and say  thank you   and everyone else could go to sleep peacefully when before life makes then ever suffer   Twice as much resources and wealth I m sure you could pay the hospital more to allow nature again  instead vrsus over everyone  including the hospital  they do a gnda 2 one to take out half randomly,1,1
Coffee and many Subscribers have been in crypto all year though  Still good overview  3 Blockchain is here  Web 3 is here for a few Web 2 5 will be what gets us to widespread adoption  3,1,2
Buying your million token is dumb ,1,2
Is that Mt  Everest in the background,1,2
 techlead what s the ETA on getting Million token on cardano ,1,2
I came back weeks later to see if he s still salty  and this dude is petty af  Lol tech bum always amuses,1,2
Weren t you the main character in squid games  How did that happen  Great role ,1,1
I love how Coffee slammed you so hard you went back on your own morals to get back at him for exposing you  ,167,1
Couldn t be more obvious this dude is PUMPING THE    ZILLA  STOCK,1,1
I have been making losses trying to make profit trading  I thought trading demo accounts is just like trading the real market    Can anyone help me out or at least advise me on what to do ,3,1
 He can t even code  feels like  you don t even lift bro ,4,3
 Kirito Kun you don t need to code to understand how the blockchain works,5,
 techlead   love your videos  Question  what about cryptocurrency as a CURRENCY though  As in  having the ability to work for wages in crypto and then after work go to the grocery store and buy food for the family   Off first glance the answer should be why  not  But who on earth would want to spend or accept such a currency that fluxuates so wildly  I mean the costs involved in getting a banana to a store shelf doesn t have a lot of profit margin to be eating up by market fluxuations  And then there is the problem of which crypto to use  There are thousands of these  currencies  today  and more being added daily it seems   Its no wonder why the world still uses fiat  There has to be some predictability and stability for people to want to spend it  don t you think   But if you are talking about applications of crypto in the world then I agree   there are many uses to be discovered   Let me know your thoughts on this as a spending currency on the street for tangible items ,2,1
Cryptocurrency is not as dumb as it is strange weird  if not shady in all sorts  It is too prone to many market fluctuations  the market itself is weird and I don t even wanna talk about the other topic you just duscussed   Let s see and hope things work in the future in terms of thesr things ,1,1
People who don t agree with us are stupid  Sums up the video,1,1
  sure techlead a tshirt has no value,1,1
Never seen someone talk so much and say so little  Well done Tech Lead,1,3
hello Techlead what DEFI token one can invest or buy and new token coming out ,1,1

Didn t you upload popular videos and gain views from bashing cryptocurrency like just 6 Months ago,1,1
dude you scammed lmao,1,1
I HAVE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRADING MYSELF   I THOUGHT TRADING ON DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET    CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST ADVICE ME ON WHAT TO DO ,5,2
Cryptocurrency is not dumb  People like you who create altcoins are dumbest  The whole point of cryptocurrency was to have a decentralized currency  But people who use crypto as a investment tool destroyed the whole idea ,1,1
Id love to see this guy fed haymakers,1,1
MILLION TOKEN WENT TO 0            ,2,1
True  0 000001 actually  Now its at 20 usd  Lol  Im glad i didnt buy into this crap  Id rather invest in better crypto projects,1,
What happen to MM TOKEN WTF   ,1,1
I get depressed everytime I think about if I were this guy or lived by his mentality lmao what a sad existence  but maybe blissfully stubborn ,12,5
 stachowi he was always like this  he just got caught this time badly ,2,
Sucks he was rich and had a great channel and then he got greedy and sold out ,5,
Even time and effort spent on something seen to be a waste of time can make you learn many things    Then afterwards if you think its all nonsense   you should be in the perfect place to profit ,1,1
Coffee got into this guy head   someone cant let it go hahaha,26,1
Question from Tech lead    is cryptocurrency dumb   Answer from tech lead in this video   yes some part of it maybe dumb  Like a million coin   ,5,1
I m gonna miss the dislike button for videos like these ,1,3
  A friend is only your friend as long as you remaing below or at their level   is it just me or this is a dumb as fvck motivational quote  4 56,1,1
Don t feel bad for your supporters  they deserve to get scammed by you ,6,2
 This is is it guys  we made it  we re millionaires    Tech Lead,19,1
Crypto is made to give hope  Basic need that every human ,1,1
Still dont care,1,1
I advise y all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses The market is very unstable and you can t tell if it s going bearish or bullish While myself and others are trad n without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket  It all depends on the pattern you follow  I was able to make 13 BTC from 2 1 BTC in just July from implementing trades with tips and info from micah Gerland,30,9
In reality at least here in Europe  bank transfer takes 0 00000001s to make and costs 0 00000Eur  How long a Bitcoin transfer takes and how much does it cost ,1,1
First of all   you claim to be a Multimillionaire and your parents are buying 15k used cars  Why cant you just buy the people who raised you a new car  maybe a tesla or some other EV  I mean you claim to be so wealthy    ,1,1
dislike,1,1
Techlead  it is over  People don t listen whatever you say  Stop uploading youtube videos  and live your fancy millionaire life  Once you lose trust  it is hard to recover ,2,1
By seeing the like dislike ratio  I understand that the removal of the dislike button is for creators like him ,310,7
       Hiding the downside of creators failures  I prefer full and honest disclosure regarding the general market sentiment ,1,
Sad YouTube removed it,3,
 Flame hmm   I don t think techlead would be opposed to the dislike button  He seems like a guys who would be pro free speech ,4,
 Craig Johnson techlead prolly,4,
Yup,3,
It s to curb the sheeple,7,
This is why the dislike button shouldn t have been removed  but he can still see it in youtube studio  so smash it anyways ,2,1
Downvoteee,1,1
Stop ,1,1
Crypto s  3 trillion worth is valued in fiat USD ,3,1
man  i still can t tell if this guy is being satirical or not it feels like he s kidding right  right   ,5,2
Seems like a weird combination of sarcasm and arrogance on the Asperger s spectrum ,3,
I especially got ad block for this dude lol ,18,1
You re not Elon Musk ,2,1
omg I was so confused from watching your howto learn python video and now I realize why,7,0
What s really dumb are the people that fell for your million token ,344,7
 Jaishwnd no the people who wish other harm are low life,2,
I don t get why people are so mad at him tbh  Million Token is a fucking meme token  What did people expect  It was going to compete with Ethereum  Cardano  Solana  Y all have yourselves to blame  I bought one for the meme with zero expectations ,15,
 Jaishwnd i hate techlead but i dont know how hes a low life  Can you explain,3,
 TRMC Crypto you re right  tech lead is a low life ,14,
 stachowi low life,3,
Hopefully he goes to jail and never sees his son again ,27,
Seriously  what happened to this channel  Used to be so genuine  Looks like he is selling out for profits and not caring about sustainability  He must be making enough not to care about this channel long term ,125,5
They say money unveils true colors ,2,
 StudioArtFX  The best way to make money is talking about making money    Finance Gurus,10,
Oh  and that s probably the case with most crypto YouTubers  They make more telling their thousands of followers about crypto than from actually trading or investing in crypto ,12,
There s a video where he shows and breaks down how much he makes talking about crypto  I think it was  like   200K per month  if I remember correctly  It was a lot more than he makes  from  crypto for sure ,4,
 The transaction could have been done in crypto   Yeah  but it wasn t  That s the thing  Crypto is used 99  for speculation and that s the issue ,12,4
Hey  Techlead what phone you use  you should do a video on why you picked that phone model ,1,1
He didn t call out all crypto currency  he actually said he has some  he talks about SCAMS  such as your coin  did you not really pay attention and just talk bc you have a mouth ,2,1
I knew this guy was a shill since day one ,2,1
Let s be honest  crypto is literally the Wild West right now  Unless there is regulation  there will be more and more frauds and scams  which WILL limit the authenticity of crypto,3,1
Im confused about what he s trying to say about the T Shirts  Like  does he really think coffee s convinced the shirt market s going to be the next big thing  Should someone explain merch to Tech Lead ,2,1
0 01 nice emphasis on the  b  in   dumb ,1,1
I disliked this video,1,1
You talk a lot about decentralisation when a lot of the current blockchain projects are far from being decentralised  two in the top ten are highly centralised  sol bsc ,11,3
 Decentralized metaverse    lol  the whole issue with meta is that it s centralizing what s already decentralized ,42,1
butthurt,1,1
As a subscriber of Coffee    he really should have done  or talked about research as he normally does  research before making a quick video shitting on something  in my honest opinion  since his channel s fundamental principle relies on thorough research    His videos are usually researched down to the T  but the alt coin video felt    a little under baked to me    I know nothing about Floki   if I was a 1 2 brain cell  I would blindly listen to everything people I sub to say  Good thing I m not  I did my own research after the video   Coffee didn t mention any in detail research he normally does  which disappointed me    This is why people need to do their own research instead of dying on the hill of their favourite YouTuber s opinions on a matter they haven t even researched themselves     No  I m not invested in Floki or anything like that  Just think more research should have have been on the topic at hand ,1,2
Good take mate u right but risky with the type of audience he has build as its sorta misleading,1,
His fav word   Opportunity   lol,7,2
lolll,1,
As it is said  Don t invest in something that you don t understand   There is no harm and shame in it ,44,7
 Neil James unfortunately despite being in the markets for 20 years  I don t think u know the real meaning of diversification  Calling someone ignorant because they do not invest in something you believe in  also show a high level of immaturity and insecurity  Ultimately  it s his money and he s making healthy profits doing so   so I suggest you stick to what you do and he stick to what he knows best,2,
I don t know about your thought process but I am from India  I have made more than 40  by investing in my countries financial market in this year itself  I think it is more than enough for me  Hence there is no reason to invest in things that I don t understand ,2,
You can say what ever you want but if you don t invest in crypto you just lost millions   Your ignorance will cost you  ,2,
Who wants to take advice from a dude that had his bioasset stolen from him    Hopefully  he is able to make more bioassets,19,2
Didn t you say bitcoin is going to zero last crash ,1,1
I love how coffee lives rent free in your head dude,319,8
Basically people aren t allowed to talk about other without people accusing them of having that person living rent free in their head    sure ,3,
 K B say it to me in person bud,1,
That s because he drink Coffee every day  He depends on coffee  Without coffee  tech lead would have been tech support ,14,
Because coffee exposed him hahahaaaaaa,11,
 Kevin Gomez publicity  Idk know man    coffee stop responding to him long time ago   ,7,
More free publicity  Very intelligent of him to do so    ,4,
i find it funny how elon musk wants to save the planet we live in while mark zuckerburg wants to make a new digital world on a planet thats going to end ,1,2
lol  Musk wants to pack up and leave  He doesn t give 2 shits about  saving the planet  as long as it doesn t get him public attention ,1,
It s funny too see another person join the crypto environment  I ve been in the space for years and it always happens like this  People make fun of it and eventually go all in  Tech lead is no different ,12,2
I am new here just subbed   Is he legit though   About what he says about crypto ,1,
Is cardano worth investing in  ,2,1
Now who is using who for clout now     hahah  He not mentioned a word about you  The irony is gold   I remember the good old days when this channel was thriving ,1,1
When I first saw NFT it reminds me how 20 years ago the market organically made SOJ the de facto currency in the Diablo 2  This truly solves a huge problem and has a great market value,8,2
Dude you are smart enough to go get a rocket ship in your back yard like jimmy neutron no I tried to buy crypto currency but my girlfriend took all my money and I lost like fifteen bucks off some,1,1
It s the way how techlead just naturally transitions into promoting abt million token in every video cracks me up,158,2
He is not against crypto  he is just against shitcoins and shitty nfts  nothing wrong with the tech,1,1
That s an accurate way of describing him,1,
thanks for the intensive crypto propaganda  i am brainwashed now  putting all my money to shietcoins ,9,2
I can t use million token to buy stuff at Walmart or anything so why am I gonna buy your currency ,1,1
Crypto is useful  but right now buying isn t worth it   Buy it after the stock market crashes and people sell their crypto to reinvest in stock ,11,1
Um  WTF   I came directly from your video posted 5 months ago saying BTC will go to zero  Seriously what are you on ,1,1
I HAVE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRADING MYSELF   I THOUGHT TRADING ON DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET    CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST ADVICE ME ON WHAT TO DO ,44,3
I like how even in promotional material for their crypto they are displaying stacks of dollar bills ,50,2
May you share what software do you use to make cut edit your videos  thanks,1,1
Million Token  90  from ATH in a fucking bull market  Great Investment  thanks for the tip man ,11,4
All cryptos start life this way  For a 4 month old project  what do you expect  Some people just want instant riches I guess,2,
Up 24x from its launch 4 months ago and up 70  from last month  ,2,
He has been desperately trying to get coffees attention for months    this is getting awkward   ,8,1
Remember techlead  said bitcoin is going to zero back in may ,323,23
It looks like his views are going to zero first LOL,1,
 ChunkyMunky That doesn t mean bitcoin will be worth 0  at that point it ll become even more expensive and worth so much a piece no body will be using it as currency and treat it more like a diamond  Read what you said lmfao  all bitcoin would have to be sold on every exchange ever for it to go to zero  That s about impossible,1,
 Ye Kai I was Sherlock Holmes in my past life  Elementary my dear sir  elementary  ,2,
 James Buttery meant to say bitcoin  Great deduction skills u have,3,
 Ye Kai brilliant analysis     Unlike gold which has uses  gold has no use   Just brilliant ,7,
Cause all these nerds are likely paid to promote nothing into something ,2,
 James Buttery the problem is bitcoin have no utility except for a store of value  However unlike gold which have uses  bitcoin does not have any use and hence have 0 intrinsic value  Unlike etheruem and BNB which have intrinsic value bitcoin is going to 0,1,
 ChunkyMunky      I m sure all the coders out there missed that bug except you  If that was true they would upgrade it just like upgrade to Taproot tomorrow  Bitcoin is over a TRILLION DOLLAR asset  It s not going to zero ,14,
Bitcoin is going to 0 that s an undeniable fact It s only a question of when  There is a bug in bitcoin code where it will become impossible to trade or mine because the gas fees will be to high and you ll eventually reach a point every computer on earth won t be able to crack the algorithm ,5,
 Nikola Blandon Bro techzilla literally admitted himself that he only backed like 15k USD coin with money he got from his followers  LOL,7,
 Nikola Blandon what were his lies  Can you explain,12,
When he could sell his worthless MM coins  he changed his narrative  He scammed people with his MM coins by lying that it was backed by 1 1 with his money ,34,
 Illuminatus Deus I agree on risk versus rewards  though I think it will be viewed differently for each person  I seriously down all those miners and crypto farmers in China just deleted their wallets which may have been worth six or seven figures  They will more than likely find ways to move operations to Vietnam or Thailand  Also  a foreigner living in China may not plan to stay there forever  will avoid messing with it while there  and can simply hold onto whatever wallets they have for future use elsewhere  But  yeah  it s not worth losing a job or jail  unless someone has millions  in which case they will probably move anyway ,1,
 Illuminatus Deus Not wanting to get myself in trouble  as I mainly live in China  but does it matter the level of consequence of the country  It s very cheap to travel around here  before the bug anyway   If you  just as an example  used a private coin to buy something and have it shipped to you  who s going to know ,1,
And yet Asia has the most Bitcoin ATMs of any continent ,1,
I bet you influenced YouTube to remove the dislike count  with the current state of your channel you d benefit a lot from it haha,22,3
I can see why your wife left now,2,1
Techlead  I can even lose my wife for it ,8,2
Isn t he divorced tho ,2,
Techlead is the bestlead,1,1
The whole removing the dislike count seems to be benefiting you direct  Why do you keep making hate videos  No one likes this kind of content ,2,2
I remember when videos on this channel got 1k likes,1,1
How to like a video 1 million times  I tried the long press  still gives 1 like    Can t thank you more for creating this video   ,3,1
Coffee    punching the air right now,1,1
Selling anything is not dumb  so long as you can get someone else to pay you more than you payed for it ,5,1
I love it when techlead roasts nooooobs,1,1
Oh  so this why the new dislike rule was made on the new YouTube update ,1,1
Coffezilla is closed minded to new technology like mist traditional finance investors  He s ego won t let him be open minded  Well like techlead says he will be left in dust lmao ,3,1
Solana takes less than 5 seconds to complete a transaction and fees are below 1 cent  What he has mentioned is true  5 33,2,1
Great collaboration again,1,1
I usually don t come here  but you made it  don t do that  please ,1,1
Hey buddy  thought you were in jail  Good to see that you seem to have avoided that ,2,1
Here to dislike TechLead one last time before YouTube kills dislikes ,4,0
Damn  ima miss the dislike button   ,9,0
Right you completely missed the point of his videos ,1,0
it s actually sad techlead used to be one of my favorite channels  Maybe you re having rough times but I hope you find your way back techlead  you re doing nonsense content ,6,4
 Sushant Mehta it seems more like he wanted to make a point  his fanbase disagreed with him  he s double down on it  it s almost obvious that he s forcing it ,1,
Exactly    Tf going on with him   Has his funds dried up and he s just uploading trash content for    ,3,
coffizila ruin so many lifes out there,2,0
am I dumb if I am not interested in cryptocurrency    ,3,2
Not dumb  don t be stupid   Just ignorant   ,2,
It was inevitable until tech lead would drop the real perspective,1,0
You are not playing the long game here  Patrick  Once this thing falls apart  you are going to be known as conman for the rest of your life ,1,1
Can you get through a video without name dropping ,3,1
Buy XLM Stellar Lumens NOW  It s going to skyrocket    Big announcement coming Next week  Bag holders will become millionaires   ,1,0
Banks at least are regulated  but like you said  in the defi world  anyone can be a banker and it s unregulated   What does it say   Now you re going to lose even more money to the  bankers     unless you want to be the banker yourself and rip people off ,1,1
I want to hear your view on Metta  ex Facebook TechLead   ,2,1

Oh that is why miners selling bitcoins for USD  So they know it is BS,1,4
 Yuanqi Chau you statement does not make any sense  I buy food to eat with USD and nobody accepting trash Bitcoin for food,1,
Don t invest in crypto   invest in the first true social token  MILLION ,1,1
Great information  thanks again TL   ,3,1
I can t  stop laughing when I watch this guy ,67,3
I think decentralized web  is gonna be super important  but idk if the metaverse will be as important as some think  I think metaverse like things will happen  or some standards will be opened so you can show off your NFT s on xbox  PC  phone  etc  but the reality is  reality will still be just as present  I just think it will add to what we already have  in a smaller way than imagined   I think there are a lot of legal and business issues in regards to why you wouldn t fully integrate blockchain into your games  apps  We ll probably see people use crypto more as a way to get venture funds  free marketing  etc for a technology that could be built without crypto  I think crypto will fill a ton of new niche rolls  allowing for things that couldn t be made before  to be made  mostly decentralized versions of things we have now for security reasons  as well as illegal finance stuff  ,1,1
Mans like dislike ratio is already like 50     Go pay your child support        as a millionaire ,1,2
Aren t you the genius who told everyone to sell crypto because of tether fears ,31,3

Congratulations   you created a sh t coin and bought your first Bitcoin in 2020 2021 ,3,1
The Holy Bible isn t meant to be taken literally of course it s fictional  Life is a movie and the best script ever written in my opinion is the good book  Just how a movie script is written to inspire us and teach us a lesson  I believe that the Holy Bible is inspired by GOD  Go to Jesus he will heal all of your pain ,1,1
My favorite part about Techlead is he spent a month calling crypto stupid  made a meme coin  then accidentally stumbled onto DeFi and changed his mind  I m not even throwing shade  it shows that he ll change his mind when he s wrong ,10,8
 PBandBruno I understand your viewpoint but if you re taking any of these YouTubers literally then I m sorry but you re just not very bright   I watch both of them btw and enjoy those videos ,2,
He guarenteed bitcoin would go to 0 before it would hit 50k  he defamed a man who spends his time researching other people s false narratives and scams  Can we please quit giving this weirdo any credit,7,
Please explain to me what is the problem that cryptos solve that we cannot solve with tradicional banking  And it must be a pretty big problem since owning crytos imply taking a huge risk due to wild price variation  There isn t a single one  all things ever mentioned are aspects that only radical libertarians would care about  i e  decentralized money  as if 99  of the people buying cryptos could even understand the difference   The fact that some people are making money from cryptos doesn t mean it s a solid investment  People make money buying lottery tickets or playing in Casinos as well  It s not even an investment  it s just speculation  Read Bitcoin s white paper  it s supposed to be a currency  a medium of exchange  not an investment ,1,2
 a friend is only your friend as long as you remain below or at their level    techlead,193,13
 Spongey1985 well  maybe it s because nothing really changed during these 20 years  The wealthy ones are still wealthy  the not so wealthy ones are still not so wealthy  If someone in your friend group actually worked to  improve himself  his life  his financial situation  he would have seen that this statement is very true  Good thing no one is doing anything in your little circle  so you get to keep your  friends  ,1,
 FuZZbaLLbee that s why they are your friends because they have more than you and they feel superior  don t feel  jealous as you said  So it is true ,2,
   This statement is itself ironical false  because it contradicts itself  when you are befriended with somebody and you are  below  them  whatever this shall mean   you are befriended with somebody who is  superior  to you  Therefore  the statement is wrong from your the other perspective       However  if you have friendships without being a friend yourself  the statement can be true      But I hope that this is not the case  even though this way of thinking suggests something else   ,4,
Someone said that when a friend becomes successful a little bit of us die within  Why is that ,1,
If that where true I wouldn t have many friends left  since most of them have more   At least I don t have to worry about them being jealous  ,2,
That was spectacular  very true indeed  ,2,
            ,2,

I m surprised you haven t done an M1 pro max review yet ,2,1
Sad YT will hide dislikes  loved seeing that I was not the only one disliking TechLead bad videos   manners   approach,3,1
Why do you lie to your viewers ,1,1
I have no idea why the stupid algorithm keeps throwing you at me Also  cryptocurrency is just a fancier version of gambling in my opinion  at least for now,2,3
I think life is a just a fancier version of gambling in my opinion ,1,
You re not wrong  although all investments are calculated gambles to begin with ,1,
  Cryptocurrency is stupid    founder of the millions coin ,32,1
Still think it s dumb  What could I do with crypto currency  I don t see any use for it  The only thing I see as right now is gambling ,3,5

Techlead has explain so well the future of crypto in less than 12 minutes  great job  Maybe after few years coffeezilas viewers will realize how much opportunity and time they have wasted ,8,1
Coffee is milking his viewers like everyone else  although he s preventing them from taking advantage of early opportunities ,3,
4 ads in a 11 min video is a little too much,1,1
any just getting into this is a late adopter i was reading about and making simple  web 3 0  apps about 2 or 3 years ago,1,1
 Blockchain and Internet 3 0 is the future  Cryptocurrency is a small micro scoping part of all this  ,4,2
web 3 0 is dumb how are you going to process and maintain state for billions even trillions of users on a decentralized database and web server  so dumb  how  many requests does a major web app like say youtube process every second  and how many database operations do they do every second  you think a decentralized system can handle that  lol  the cost is insumountable  dumb right,5,1
Cryptocurrency would be one of the most freeing and amazing advancements for hoi polloi if not for eventual government regulation and overreach  I see it sadly becoming a tool that boxes people into to a dystopiaan nightmare world  No physical gold or dolalr bills to hold in your hands  People can say the blockchain keeps things transparent like ye olde ship ledgers of yore  but those were physical also  Scary world incoming ,1,2
Axie infinity already has blockchain game integration   ,1,1
Ah yes finally the next episode of the most epic anime battle,2,1
Crypto currency is surely the future  though it might take some time for it to completely replace fiat currency  IMPORTANT    How can I buy Million Tokens from India in Indian rupees  I could not find any exchange that sells MM tokens in India in Indian Currency  Any ideas Tech Lead  ,1,1

People have been saying this crap about crypto for a decade now Techboy  Where s the revolution  All I see is cryptoheads circle jerking each other  Those mobile apps that you were such an early adopter on certainly didn t take this long lolololol,5,3
Million Token is the next moonshot  and Web 3 0 is the future,2,1
Coffee just doesn t want people to be scammed  sometimes overreacts and can jump to conclusions  He means well  I respect you both and accept some people just cannot get along   I wont choose sides and see you both as great men ,7,3
CZ voices opinions that can ruin someone s business reputation   He should do thorough research before accusing people   I don t know if TL was unethical in the way he reportedly withdraw funds from MillonToken  but CZ should have requested to interview  TL before releasing his video   CZ was unprofessional  and could be sued if TL wants to take that route ,4,
Coffee just wants to make that YouTube passive income   no one gets a  10 million dollar studio if that s even real  just to help people   I used to watch his content and he is correct in many cases but you can also see where he just doesn t do proper due diligence and he doesn t really provide any value   Watching him is a complete waste of time,3,
The real question here is  how many keyboards does one millionaire need   ,3,1

Bitcoin is going to zero   TechLead,3,1
TechLead has a financial interest in promoting crypto  Before he created his own  coin   he didn t have so many good things to say about it ,1,4
Yeah  and your point is   He s one of the best coders in the world who has spotted the next revolution in his workspace  Do you blame him for changing his stance  applying his talent to the technology ,2,
HBAR Hedera Is better than the blockchain,1,1
On a side note  techlead must be pleased at the dislike button going away,4,3
