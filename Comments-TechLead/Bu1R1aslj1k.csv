Great video and some nice tips  This is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions  This could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount  Wealth is created during bear markets  not bull markets  If your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk  Let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon  I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 16  btc from day trading with ALEX VALENTINE in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearishyt,201,15

 Great video really  Also i agree with your opinion  For the newbie if you are actually trading in the crypto space and you don t have a sound mentor  Then you are certainly going to get liquidated in 90  of your trades   Yeah that s the sad truth  For a start you need a good and experienced hand to guide you  Trust me  trading isn t difficult as we see it  With the right Signals and guide  you can earn hugely monthly ,182,12
You re right  I have lost alot trading all by myself without a guide  It s been an uneasy ride for me  Who is your mentor please  I actually don t mind paying ,1,

 Toller  sehr detaillierter und auf den Punkt gebrachter Videoartikel  den du gepostet hast  Kumpel  ich liebe deine Inhalte  Es ist lustig  wie manche Leute immer noch nicht akzeptiert haben  dass Kryptow hrungen die Welt im globalen Ma stab weiterhin umgestalten  Wer dagegen ist  hat es heutzutage schwer  W hrend ich aus H ndlersicht denke  dass wir wirklich mehr Experten auf diesem Gebiet brauchen  um Neulingen Investoren beizubringen  wie die Community funktioniert  schwankte der Preis von BTC in letzter Zeit  was bedeutet  dass der Markt derzeit offen ist und man es nicht sagen kann  Wenn es zu bearish oder bullish wird  vertreibt diese Ungewissheit die meisten H ndler und h lt die Anleger s chtig  Ich w rde sagen  dass es v llig falsch ist  herumzusitzen und zu warten  Vielleicht sind ein paar Linienverluste der falsche Weg  um f r einen Anleger zu denken  denn als Anleger werden Sie feststellen Die M glichkeiten  immer mehr M nzen zu vermehren und nachzuladen  sollten unsere oberste Priorit t sein  um einen Gewinn zu erzielen  Es h ngt alles von dem Muster ab  in dem Sie handeln  und von der Quelle Ihrer Strategien  Ich habe mit 2 BTC angefangen und in nur 4 Wochen  ber 4 5 BTC angesammelt  mit der richtigen Handelsstrategie  die mir von einem erfahrenen H ndler  Mr  Trey Hornsby  gegeben wurde  Seine Methoden sind ausgezeichnet und profitabel und Argon kann leicht  ber Telegram  Treyhornsby kontaktiert werden,3,3

I m 70yrs old in a few weeks and bought crypto in 2017 purely because l hated what the banking system was doing to the ordinary man and women on the street  I have hodled ever since and simply watched it grow 5X  Now l wish to go further and so happy l came across your channel and subscribed  I am scared   to trade but need to make more than my government pension and modest savings which at present is 100  into bitcoin  I am therefore grateful for your ideas and tips in this video and will take action and leave my comfort zone  ,35,1

Thanks for the continues videos  I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space  in general or probably just naive  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring  more equities towards trading session  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading  since it s way profitable than holding  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to arise over 6 btc when I started at 1 5btc in just 5 weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from  Mark Hamill  I would advise y all to trade your assets rather than hold for future you aren t sure about  the future is now   44 7897 037108 whsapp  Markhamill6   on Telgrm   ,72,0

But the question for me is how will crypto sales gains be taxed  As income or personal property  And do the bots account for that range of potential tax you ll be hit with  Does it try to take advantage of wash sales or any other advanced trading strategies to minimize losses come tax time  I doubt it ,5,3

 Quantum Pilot haha I thought about doing something like that  using low gas fee token solely for the transferring funds between wallets  I m still weary of transferring crypto from wallet to wallet cause I m afraid of sending something to incompatible address  So I avoid transfers at all costs ,1,
Buy from whoever exchange  offers you low fees or free  buy a low gas coin e g XLM or xrp   move to an exchange home you want to trade   sell it  low gas token  for their stable crypto  e g  usdt from the exchange  now you can buy anything in the exchange if you like  Saving for the long term  then buy and decide if you are leaving them in the exchange home wallet or your own  If trading  then changes fiat into a stable coin as stated ,2,
I m not the wisest man in crypto  but I d recommend keep your tokens at the exchange  ie Binance  Kucoin  if you re actively trading  And take your crypto out of exchange and into wallet  ie Ledger  Trezo  when you re planning to keep it as long term investment  Unless it s a token with low gas fees then you could move it in an out of the wallet as much as you can afford ,1,
 The crypto market has been favourable in the past weeks  I keep missing out on this opportunity  I m most certainly very impatient how can I ever make a profit in the crypto market  ,4,14

A vast amount of people all across the world are engaged in trading bitcoin I am never bothered about the current price Its because trading of BTC is the best method to earn huge profits traders only have to learn plenty of tips and strategies before entering into the trading market to get more chances of earning than losing  i m taking full advantage  to continue bitcoin day trading so as to grow a very strong portfolio ahead of the major bull market after this short correction,1,3
Liquidity pooling is not really a long position  as there is the risk of impermanent loss ,1,1
that is specifically why it is a long term play lol  impermanent loss is realized upon breaking lp  so you sit through the volatility collecting the fees  Unless specifically arguing 1 asset will for increase massively in the short term  in which case you are in the mindset of a trader  and they very well may work and cause you to see higher gains  At the same time it might not work and you miss out on the yield  and if it goes the wrong direction  instead of lp impermeant loss you take 100  losses on the single asset  It s not a position for the highest returns  its a position to reduce risk while offering a return ,1,
Good analysis Trading Ethereum is a great way to make money particularly in today s economic climate there are many strategies that Ethereum traders employ  including day trading  arbitrage and automated bot trading where repetitive purchases and sales of Eth have the goal of generating profit Bobby Mickael gave me best trip to excel in Ethereum today ,1,3

What about fees   I mean if Bitcoin goes up and down 5  then aren t you trading at a loss due to high fees,10,3
It s just like real estate  they never tell you about realtor fees  closing costs  property tax and utilities cost ,1,
Bingo  major coins rarely flactuate more than 5 8  when trading side ways  Bots are there to generate fees for the exchange  In my eyes  the tax implications from all those transactions are not worth it ,4,

 Idrissa Thiam I d love to answer but youtube is deleting my replies ,1,
 Idrissa Thiam If somehow all crypto exchanges exploded and a mass selloff occured  defi would continue to work  Maybe you d end up having to pay higher gas fees to get your transactions to go through  but there is no worry about the network itself shutting down  For that to happen it would require all nodes and validators which are typically quite decentralized to go down at once  A highly unlikely scenario ,2,
I guess I should try to answer my own question   I imagine  it would be impossible for many holders to sell and convert their assets into fiat  Many crypto exchanges may fail as well and their listed tokens would disappear   I guess this does represent a situation of systemic risk     I am not trying to peer above my intellectual paygrade but I m trying to see what would happen if December 27th  2017 repeated itself  I am a crypto defi supporter but I am wondering how resilient this monetary system actually is   If anyone else could explain it to me  I would be grateful ,1,
