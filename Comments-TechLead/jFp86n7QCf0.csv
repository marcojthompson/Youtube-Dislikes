 Katano Martinez I agree  my thoughts are the BCH will be  50k within 5 years when they run out of BTC ,1,
 Cathy Lake Cathie Wood has a prediction of a 500k Bitcoin this year at a 7 trillion markertcap  Bitcoin had a 2 trillion Marketcap and peaked at 65k  So if you 3x 1 2  65k that will get you a  227 500 Bitcoin  That s where i think the approximate all time high will be at for Bitcoin this year  That being said  Bitcoin Cash follows the same exact pattern as Bitcoin  Bitcoin Cash all time high this year was about  1 600 and so 3x 1 2 that price will leave you with a  5 600 BitcoinCash   Regardless of the energy consumption it doesnt matter  Miners will adopt solar panels for mining  It reduces the cost of electricity while increasing their revenue  Mining Bitcoin already used a lot less energy than anything else  Look at the comparison charts on google    The 4 top coins on every exchange is Bitcoin  Ethereum  Bitcoin Cash  and Litecoin  That s what the fund managers are going to offer at the banks    meaning at some point more money will flow through those coins before anything else  Bitcoin Cash has halvening just like Bitcoin during the same year as BTC  I expect in future for Bitcoin Cash to be the next Bitcoin  Once Bitcoin is too expensive for the average person  people will look at Bitcoin Cash as the alternative ,1,
 QT LOL We are laughing all the way to the bank ,1,
Bitcoin is a joke,1,
 Katano Martinez I think you are right 100k BTC this bull cycle is likely  How do you think BCH will do since it is capped at  21 million also  uses way less energy to mine and had an all time high of  4k but is now on bargain sale price for about  600  BCH is being used by paypal and bitpay ,3,
 IE Ok you won t say that when you  have to wheel a wagon  full of fiat to get a loaf of bread and everyone who has 1 bitcoin is a millionaire in 10 years  my opinion not advice   You do not understand hedge against inflation  so I am wasting my time debating you  Bitcoin has proved itself  to institutions to to be a long lasting currency or their advisors would not have gained the ok to sell bitcoin to investors  Once you have institutional buy in that is my signal to buy a coin based on price history and use case  so I don t have any doge coin or any other such risky coins ,2,
 M C Don t close yourself off to the amount of opportunity out there  If you like ADA which I love myself  then you love Hedera  They are backed by Industry Giants like IBM  BOEing  Deutsche Telekom  and you ready for this  GOOGLE  Dotcom Bubble Veteran Google has chosen to jump into the Crypto space while it s still in it s Bubble Era and chose Hedera out of several THOUSAND projects  That tells you everything you need to know right there   Follow the smart money    And the Bubble surviving Industry Giants ,1,
 JCT343 Cardano is the only crytpo I am comfortable with ,1,
 Cathy Lake Crypto is the biggest risk  Riskier than fiat  It s also unregulated  Fraudsters galore ,1,
After thinking for  while  you have a serious point ,1,
 DeathSleep Not sure what you are doing but with most stable coins you earn 12  interest  Depending on the crypto currency one has can also earn interest on it  I compensate by buying the dip  trading when its convenient  and leverage  Leverage can be shorted or long  So a person can make money regardless of the direction the market is going  Don t panic sell  I have inside info on the situation  You will be seeing a 100k BTC soon,2,
 IE Stay broke you had your chance  Bitcoin stopped being a casino gamble and became an investment this year  when the investment banks and corps added it to their portfolios  Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation  Like a rare piece of artwork  but fractionally spendable  You know what is riskier and more of a gamble    Keeping all your assets in worthless paper they just keep printing with no end in sight  That is why i have also invested in physical platinum   gold  silver and land with a pond and spring  Diversification is key  but all the smart money has at at least 10  of their assets in  capped big name crypto ,1,
 IE Scared money don t make money  To make money in anything you have to risk money  I wish I had put a  1000 in bitcoin when my friends told me to when it was less thank a  1  I ended up investing when it was  10k  Although I am not a whale and neither is Tech lead he can afford to make an educated  gamble  on one bitcoin  Look at the price graphs there is clearly a pattern now and it is being adopted for purchase by investment banks and states like Wyoming ,1,
 IE The Federal Reserve isn t run by banks  It is the largest PRIVATE bank  Most people think it s a government bank because  it holds the word  federal  in its tittle   Certainly this bull cycle as the last was orchestrated by a large institution or collection of  but why do you think it was bankers and not an institution like Ark investment or even Tesla or both   Elon adopted Bitcoin for Tesla to make one of the big 4 pump legs  Then he put out negative news to cause a drop  Then when Bitcoin and Ethereum already pulled back and found crucial support  he put out another negative tweet causing a drop below that support level to the next level of support  Cathy Wood from Ark is always putting out bullshit propaganda about how Bitcoin is going up to some astronomical number  And she is close with Elon  A so called former Ark analyst  an Asia fellow  says Ethereum is going go 40k then 120k   The evidence is pointing to Ark Investment and Tesla working together if you ask me ,2,
 revo1974 I bought Ethereum when it was somewhere 285  Just Increasing my position ,2,
 IE hahahaha ok mate  Did the US Fed sell 4 Trillion dollars of Oil to fund the expansion of the M2 money supply this year  Nope didn t think so  Try again,1,
Lol isnt that what the US Fed does  ,1,
 IE Except in some countries they are already being used to purchase goods and services so they are not worthless outside of the casino  Paypal is taking bitcoin and bitcoin cash also  He is being paranoid selling ALL of his bitcoin and he will regret it in both short and longterm  It should hit at least 100k by EOY and  500k in 5 years in my opinion ,1,
 GoofTuber But sell all    Why not just take a little profit above what he invested so he has no losses    People who have completely withdrawn are being paranoid ,2,
 John Elly Calipusan long term this meme coin is probably going to nothing  It s bs,1,

I am so glad that I still have my crypto  I think the reality of the situation is a lot of people are using crypto as a hedge against inflation rather than a way to get around Financial regulations  With regulation also comes opportunity  With Bitcoin now being legal tender in El Salvador  the demand for crypto will only grow ,1,0

From a personal point of view I feel crypto got to be best thing that has happened to the financial market for awhile now  it continues to open room for bulk gains whether in holding or most importantly trading  looking closely at Ethereum it started a fresh rally above the resistance zone against the US Dollar and it seems there is high chance for more upside  and the current trend would reveal the amount of institutes that have embraced the use of the crypto assets to optimal results thats why i will say ETH is only just in the early stage of a bigger surge  Considering the the bulk return one get from trading than just holding it might be too late buy an asset while holding but its never late to buy in while trading crypto and with trading crypto i have gained  170K in my portfolio but i didnt do it all by myself but with accurate strategy and signals from an expert trader Chen lawrence   With Adam help I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin  you can easily get to Isaac  on  Teleg  ram   chentrading1   1 724 228 4787 on whatpp,2,0

Regardless if you think BTC is going up or down in price  and I could care less about that  it is incorrect to call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme   A Ponzi scheme has some very specific criteria and there isn t a single aspect of BTC that meet that criteria ,1,0

 Eric Donald You re correct  I don t lose money every single trade  but my main problem is trying to let my runners run  Very rarely do I catch big moves   Instead they go a few pips in my direction  then go against me if when I try holding them  Also my entries could use a lot of improvement  A mentor would be amazing  but getting one is easier said than done  If it s not too much to ask  do you know any legit ones ,1,
Do whatever it takes not to listen to him  don t give up  Trading takes time months  even years  to pro  even the experts learn conventional  Never the less  if you lose money paying little mind to which side you take  maybe you need to look at how you are directing powerful trades rather than how you are entering them  My proposal  find a mentor   Also  besides  try combining the use of oscillators  Bollinger and turn centers into your method  Additionally  specifically move to higher TFS 4h or 1D in a perfect world   you ll offer thanks toward me later  ,4,
Your problem could be your stop loss is too close or you re watching your trades too much  Place it and walk away  Or you could just give up  trading isn t for everyone ,1,

Exactly this is what i thought when i went into the stock market  Even if it is fun  interesting and hyped the fact that one hedge fund or organisation or one rich person aka musky is driving the price high or low in a big factor is exactly the oposite of what  investing  or a  stable investment  is  Everyone is saying decentralizing is good but it feels like it is way more unstable than vise versa ,15,0

I find it funny that people are rushing to buy or sell crypto in general just on hearing Elon tweet  despite the recent challenge at 40k USD  for market value   The truth is  Bitcoin is way bigger than anyone in the world currently  this is merely a start to the rise of btc and crypto in general this year  What i m trying to say is  btc is bigger than Elon and would sooner than later see better figures irrespective of his purchase This is the very reason I am focused on accumulating more btc by way of trading with high indicators and expert signals I use for personal trading from pro trade analyst Adam I ll admit it  His guide has been the reason I ve gotten 17 BTC in portfolio trading since march  he can be contacted on Tele gram   Adamfxtrading  for crypto inclined challenges issues ,1,0

Using crypto cash to pay for goods and services  both online and in person has the potential to revolutionize the way we use money on a day to day basis  Additionally  trading and investing in cryptocurrency can be lucrative and rewarding  providing the potential for high ROI thanks to how insulated the digital currency market is to conditions that would otherwise throw a wrench into a Forex or binary options exchange  That being said  using crypto in everyday transactions or crypto investing and trading is not foolproof  It often requires specialized knowledge to navigate the sometimes murky waters of the underlying technology  and crypto exchanges are subject to their own unique market conditions that may be inscrutable to the uninitiated  However  cryptocurrency is undergoing rampant growth in both popularity and use  It won t be long before major banking systems begin using adapted versions of blockchain technology to make electronic payments in fiat currency  Soon  even the most conservative financial advisors will begin recommending incorporating some cryptocoin into your investment portfolio  It s likely there will always be a place for physical money  Cold  hard cash is hard to beat  and in situations where there s no access to technology  it s still the only game in town  The rules of the game are rapidly changing  though  and cryptocurrency is one player that s not leaving anytime soon  that is why we recommend amateur trader to have a mentor and someone who trade for them with this you have an Eighty Eight percentage return  I recommend Alvin  lfred because he is the real deal when it comes to trading and learn new skills in the Crypto world  you can reach him on T E L E G R A M     lvincryptotrading   W H A Ts A P P  1 516 882 3859   Thank me Later     ,1,0

Good lord I hope nobody watches this video and takes it seriously  Tether makes up 9  of the Bitcoin market cap  Would a collapse in Tether tank Bitcoin  Yes    there would be a price dump  but to act like Tether is some sort of foundation upon which Bitcoin is built is total nonsense  The reason why Bitcoin is dumping right now is because the Pi Cycle Top just flashed  which means Bitcoin will dump down to roughly  20 000 before we can progress higher in the future ,1,2

 I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Dr  joe Olsen  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 9 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy  You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM    joehackbtc   ,2,0

I think this misses the point of crypto  I might not understand it completely but I d guess that buying Tether is just like buying any other crypto except it s programmatically pegged to one dollar  It s not like doge coin is 100  backed by USD  The point of a stable coin is simply to act as a vehicle to transfer fiat  or hold fiat as a synthetic form of the fiat  Most fiat is digital anyways just like Tether and also isn t backed by anything  That ended when we were taken off of the gold standard  Fiat currency is simply a Ponzi scheme just like a lot of crypto currencies  The only true value to be had in this world is in real hard assets like real estate  food  and other commodities along with labor and knowledge among many other tangible and essential things that provide real value  The fiat system  has just become a rigged game to keep most people from being able to obtain things of real value ,1,2

Isn t the real problem we are facing following   if said percentage of people try to liquidate their real usd savings the banks couldn t handle them the money in cash     All of the shares bought with usd would also be inflated   Don t get me wrong I don t say this whole usdt thing is not real  But it fits for most of the currencies circulating in our world economy    This is how our financial system works and usdt adapted it   That s why I am still holding onto all the kryptos because through the decentralisation they shouldn t be affected by this system   Honestly it s the only reason I hold kryptos  It seems like they are the only way out of this financial system in the future ,1,2
you pretty much just explained word for word    the federal reserve lol   anyway  truth aside  people are using tether to match the dollar so they dont  cash out  and its considered a trade  why cash out at high to buy low and lose majority of profits to the competition  fed  instead of trading to tether to wait for your position  not a cpa but arent trades cheaper than cashing out ,1,2

i feel sorry for you    Bitcoin has Died over 400 times since the beginning    Diamond hands is what most need to hold their Bitcoins and or Ethereum     why would anyone want to sell an asset that keeps appreciation every halving 4th year  its best to borrow or lend or stake your bitcoin and Never sell it ,1,0

 Kiba  if it is trading at the value of a dollar  while exchanging it for other cryptos or fiat  in my opinion  it will eventually harm the industry  the us dollar has seen ridiculous inflation and the spikes mentioned in his video may simply be to correct the value of tether accordingly  all things considered  crypto is unmistakably the future and like anything new  it is subject to growing pains and gains  if not tether  there will be exploitation and regulation in this industry  whether internally or externally or both is yet to be seen ,1,

                  It doesn t matter   as long as you STILL COULDN T use ANY of those crypto coin as legal money on your country  your government still prevail   Many governments on earth play beautifully to let use crypto but ONLY as an investment vehicle  They do not let you use it as day to day transaction and payment  They are not stupid  because it is a threat to their authority  Meanwhile they will form their own central bank digital currency and force you all to use it  because they can and they will ,1,
China couldn t ban it completely  instead their government will make their own digital crypto currency and forced their people to used it by  regulation  ,1,

I was reading some comments on here  None of you was refering to the most important part of this video  how Tether could be a threat to this whole crypto system  This is what smart investors do  due diligence  Do not blame people who try to discover the other side of the coin   embrace them ,287,27
 Black Lives Matter yes minted from nothing but instead of trusting a government treasury which has a vested interest in making a countries currency profitable    As it s population drives it s GDP  etc   You re trusting some random group of people to mint things in a responsible manner  who s only drive is in maximising profits for their pockets  They don t care about who or what happens to the general population  only what happens to their pockets   Which is the key difference between fiat and crypto ,1,
 Travis Pendell IF it doesn t shake the confidence of the speculators ,1,

It s been the same doomsday argument for years  And the most important part   how will the collapse of tether take down the entire crypto ecosystem  It would lead to some short term instability but usdt is but one of many moving parts  It s like saying the collapse of yahoo will ruin the internet ,3,
Never had an issue with tether never had an issue withdrawing either both usdt and usdc are both fine they are just as fake and minted from nothing just like fiat,2,

I have been a believer in the blockchain and the bitcoin over the years and from experience  I have learned that information about bitcoin comes from three kinds of people  One who knows but would rather suppress the information by publicly criticizing bitcoin but privately stacking up on the asset  there is also the truly ignorant who would swallow any information hook  line and sinker and of course  those that are truly devout to bitcoin and making steady progress in updating with information worth knowing  I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Dwayne  whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now  netting in more than 9 btc in profit already  Learning never ends and I am still doing so with professional Coach Dwayne Clooney you should reach him on      Tele Gramm  dwayneclooney   Have a Nice day ,29,5

The banks also  make money up out of no where   If everyone asked for the cash equivalent of their account balance at the same time  the banks would collapse   Tether will be fine  they just need to tighten up their accounting and get some more actual investors to back them up  and add some new innovations along the way ,1,0
a lot of people saying this is just FUD  FUD  FUD    but no one actually saying anything as to WHY he is wrong  Makes you think all of you here are just investors who are scared to lose and fighting back anything you hear is against your hopes and dreams  This makes me think you are all just sheep caught up in the bitcoin wave   and sheep cant think nor can they argue ,1,1

Dog coin  You ditched BTC  ETH and my fave ADA for doge and FUD       ,1,1
 I m never joking     ,4,1
Yeah he does seem like a crypto noob and can t even pronounce Doge   But there is a point in what he is saying   You can see Bitcoin and Eth running neck and neck on the charts and even when everything was crashing and then pumping after the bounce  you can see it all being moved identically   Remember  most buys on BTC  ETH and most Alts are paired with USDT  Tether    There is no definitive total supply on USDT and it s acting like an elastic coin pegged to the USD   What gives it it s intrinsic value   It seems that people uses USD and other Fiat  converted to the value of USD  to buy USDT   But who really are they buying it from   Exchanges  DEX s and Swaps that hold USDT   And where are those exchanges buying those USDT from   Tether perhaps   But then where are the  extra USDT Liquidity Pools buffer  really coming from  over and about what they are collecting in Fiat   Is it possible that Tether just randomly adding or lending  Extra Liquidity  of USDT to those exchanges with an agreement that if they use it up  then the value of which it was purchased  in USD  other Fiat or crypto like BTC   ETH  will go back to Tether   Maybe so   Think about this for a moment   What exchange wouldn t want to have  be lent or staked extra USDT just in case there was a huge move  especially a downward move  in crypto and then hodlers or traders wanted to sell said crypto   Well think on what that crypto was paired with    USDT   So yes  EVERY exchange  DEX  swap  etc wants and needs extra USDT in their USDT pools to keep the exchanges from shutting down on massive market moves    at ALL cost     NO questions asked   So think about that one for a few moments  It just may be that these exchanges are in bed with Tether on this one to get that USDT liquidity  but I m sure when it comes to an investigation of such  they would claim  Plausible Deniability         So then  when they say BTC is paired to USD  what do they really mean   Is it  in fact  really paired to USDT when it s then  tethered or pegged  to the USD   Maybe so   If you think about it  what does crypto mean vs fiat   That fiat in many countries   including the U S  for it s own USD   that it s  intrinsic value  is only backed by a  promise  of that respected government that   they  will make  good  on it s cashable or marketable  value  and not by gold  the gold standard in the US was removed from the USD by Pres  Nixon to so they could  print more money to pay for the Vietnam war and never returned back to the gold standard    So then  likewise for USDT when is to say  that there is a possibility that it s intrinsic value is made on a hopeful promise that they will make good on it  because of the total fiat used in circulation that actually purchased said USDT that people would want to spend back into fiat cash  Think about this one for a moment   There is more  Fiat  going into the crypto space by retail investors  hedge funds and whales  than what is being cashed out or taken out of the crypto space   And if the tables were flipped and more people started cashing out from the crypto space than new buyers coming in  then that is the point where you will discover the bottleneck and who would the fingers point to when there is not enough cash for buyers to cash out their BTC  ETH and other Alts    and it wouldn t take long to connect the dots with that one   So then    Let s go back to the idea  in the 1st paragraph  that Tether is accepting USD  other Fiat  which they can trade for USD on Forex exchanges   BTC   ETH for lent or extra staked USDT  by Tether to those Exchanges  DEX s and Swaps  over the years   Now who then would be one of the largest  Whales  in the crypto space  due to all that wealth building of Exchanges and such purchasing and paying back lent or staked USDT to those exchanges   Well that would be Tether themselves  tucked away neatly in one of the most securely sovereign banking safe havens in the world  One with easy access to banking and crypto exchanges  possibly their own    A perfect place to do what they want to do without any government looking over their shoulders and completely sealed in anonymity in what is happening with said funds and crypto  thereby creating one of the largest whales in crypto  that has it in there own power to manipulate the market with the perfect timing to further their own narrative  causing the demand for more USDT  where they continue to be paid for such    Imaging trading with Billions of dollars worth of BTC   ETH with 10X  20X or even 100X leverage to cause the crypto markets to do what they want it to do  timed perfectly around world events  Could this be one of the great Ponzi schemes of the crypto space that we have ever seen since the inception of BTC   That would be up to you to be your own judge of that  for yourself    Personally  I think there is a conspiracy theory here that goes deeper than what most of us crypto traders even want to know ,1,1

 Robotron Sage crypto is decentralised so that s why he hasn t got in trouble  there s no one to go after him,1,
 Rick the Swift I m actually a crypto miner and the things Elon said about bitcoin are completely bogus since we all run our GPUs  at maximum REGARDLESS of which coin we re mining  Basically speaking  more watts   more coins   And most miners usually want the most energy efficiency they can get since the GPUs last longer when they run at cooler temps etc   it saves on the electic bill    Also Tesla sold like 30 million     worth of BTC just before the dip  to   prove liquidity   lmfao  If market manipulation is illegal then how is this guy not fined or in jail already  lol,3,
 Rick the Swift musk is a friendly face for the NWO used for adoption      find the channel crypto teacher     ,6,
None of you understand this stuff  just as Elon Musk didn t understand it when he jumped in with billions of TESLA funds  and promised bitcoiners they could trade their coins for cars  Ironic and suspicious that he d back peddle on that promise just before the value of the coin was cut in half  And the the nerve of him base his decision to not accept BTC on his unfounded  environmental concerns   Hmmm  Well  now that he s finally done some research a month later after pumping and dumping the coin  now he has the gall to tell everyone that he s finally gotten around to talking to crypto miners  and they ve assured him they ll continue to meet environmental needs head on   What Bogus  Wake up people   If Elon really thinks it s environmentally safe now  shouldn t he and TESLA stay true to their promise and accept Bitcoin for payment  But what are they doing saying   One thing is for sure  if you want to buy one of his cars  you ll need to provide the proper government controlled currency   Hard to imagine what a laughing stock TESLA would be if they d actually accepted coins for cars  only to watch the coins  value fall by 50  or more in a very short amount of time ,5,

Probably the right decision  As soon as Corona is over and societies start opening up the crypto bubble will probably burst  Most gains in crypto were made during corona because normies started inflating the market with the surplus money they ve gotten during the pandemic  As soon as society opens up  normal people will pull out their cryptos and start spending their money on traveling  clothes  nightlives  resturants et c  again  Pull out before it s too late   After the crash  reinvest into crypto again  This is definitely the play ,2,1

I wanna say  sounds like tether is in cahoots with a shadow branch of fed reserve that is used to enter market control large portions of btc  and also manipulate,1,1
I think you are wise  Thank you   ,1,1
this drop in price happens every cycle lmao,5,3
 beguilingpapertiger We re currently in the 4th cycle  The stock flow model has been accurate for 13 years  The Pi Cycle Top indicator also flash at the  65 000  which indicated that we re going to crash to roughly  20 000  and then literally 3 days later we crashed to  30 000  so we ve a bit lower to go before pumping to  160 000 ,3,
LOL sorry for your loss bro  selling low and buying high    NOT how to invest ,1,1
Bitcoin won t be worth nothing it will go extinct in 3 to 5 years from now,1,1
Yo i have the same cup as you,1,1
Tech lead sells crypto into weakness   on a tether scare lol I bet he FOMOs back in at a higher price,2,1

Being a good programmer doesn t mean you will be a good investor ,3,
I just never trusted crypto currency   I just never found it necessary to use which didn t give me any confidence that it could gain increased demand so I m not surprised at this ,1,1
                       ,1,1
Amazing how a tech lead does not understand tech ,21,6

I remember hearing Tether FUD a couple of years ago for the first time and it made me sell as well  Luckily after a few hours of research I brought back in on the same day  Hopefully you ll realise this is FUD and you ll come back in ,19,4
Our pictures are similar,1,
How is this an indictment on Bitcoin and Ethereum and other valid protocols who are good actors in the crypto world  In my opinion  if you re more than just an enthusiast for crypto  you WANT it to go through its natural cycle of evolution  where the bad actors in the space  like Tether  will be weeded out   ,1,1
I sold as well,1,1
Why does this sound so familiar   reason Bitcoin drops is because it goes up so fast it becomes risky to hold for investors ,1,1
This sounds extremely similar to the deregulation that propped up the 2008 financial crisis ,1,1
u mean as a millionaire right  otherwise it doesn t make any sense   ,1,1
If you understand usecase and why gold was the standard forever then you ll understand the truth  Crypto is here to stay,1,1

 They just make more out of nothing with no backing       wait      are you talking about tether or fiat dollars   Or       how does this all work again    ,1,1
I like how he calls it DOG coin instead of Dogecoin,259,17
It is not Dog E Coin    Doge is based on the mene where the logo is from  The entire thing is a meme gone wild  Funny to see people who don t know the meme try to make sense of it  ,2,
That s what initially it was supposed to be called     perhaps dodgy would be more apt ,2,
Because it s Dog eCoin ,1,
He is right  It is Dog E coin,4,
Dog coin sounds funnier  It s something intentionally funny if you re not a boomer,3,
He was hungry when he made the video    Sorry  offensive shock humour ,11,
I call it  Dog E coin which I assumed was a play on words from Dog Electronic Coin   Doggie Coin  ,7,
I dont like that at all    Its Doge not dog ,3,
Really        ,1,1
Just hold guys  These guy is just making  Fools,1,0

Hey Eric  Fancy seeing you here   3,1,

Stock market   Crypto market is always gonna have crashes    Is crypto gonna die  No  Bitcoin   ETH gonna going down  No   Only when crash is coming is going down   How far can ETH   Bitcoin grow  Noone knows  But more than this ,1,1

Freyer experts also producr the greatest air fryers I have ever used  Brown some french fries with Freyer now ,1,

Being able to earn off my investments with Freyer experts did revive my trust that there are still trustworthy experts out there that are efficient and reliable with their services,3,
Thank you will do,2,
Great reviews about this experts I m sure trying them,1,

Are these experts sure to help me win trades and not lose ,2,
Just the sort of info I need  definitely writing them right away,2,
This shows that your work is genuine and reliable you must be given an accolade,3,
 lauren rufus thanks would write them now,1,
Seen this Freyer experts recommended elsewhere on YT  they sure seem reputable,1,
Cryptocurrency is here to stay if you can t see that at this point  it s time you learn,4,
 John Mark Freyer trade experts are behind my success in trading the bitcoin market  their strategies are awesome and indeed very reliable,6,
Bitcoin would sure raise again    ,13,
 John Mark my advice is enroll for courses  to learn more or seek an expert s assistance  Whichever  make sure it s profitable and credible to you first and foremost,6,
Crypto has been a lucrative way of making money for me and my family  ,10,
 lauren rufus would YouTube videos count as research  I m really interested in learning,1,
My advice to newbies is carry out personal research and get accustomed to the nature of the market as it is a very volatile one and requires expertise,1,
If you can t handle the dip you don t deserve the pump   ,22,
 Aaron Martinez sure bitcoin is really profitable and the most popular crypto asset  It has over 350B market cap and consistently growing in value  making it a highly sourced after investment for investors,1,
Bitcoin indeed proved beyond all doubt that it is worth generating wealth over a short period when done right  it s best you buy the dip,12,
Bitcoin has really been in the news concerning profitable investment but I really don t know much about it,8,
The digital currency that was once viewed as mysterious by many in the past would soon explode again,2,
Totally agree with you  ,14,

Poor people think about what there can buy with their  money  Rich people think about what there can invest in with their  money    the market crash is a good time to buy and some investors look forward to volatile markets to make profit   since February The one effective technique I use is staying in touch with a FA it might sound basic or generic  but getting in touch with one was how I was able to outperform the market during the pandemic made  profits of roughly  280 000  ,54,6
Our mentality is so messed up we validate ourselves with wasteful vanities  you don t need to buy that new shoe or that new car yet when you can t even guarantee yourself financial freedom  why not invest and be your own boss  my opinion,3,
Everything you said about USDT goes double for USD    LOL,3,1
This video is just embarrassing and there is absolutely no reason why anyone should ever listen to your opinion about digital assets again ,26,2
Thanks for selling them  I ll keep buying and getting rich ,107,7

Your not wrong about tether    it is dodgy    The fact they don t back 1 1 with the dollar   The fact that tether is backed partly by bitcoin   is not good    Tether prints money   tether buys btc  btc price goes up  tether prints more money    It s bad,2,3
You are bringing back 2017 concerns  Most of the issues with tether have been settled  They have even admitted they are not backed 1 1  Unlike 2017 though there are many other stable coins that people can pick from ,2,1

This guy is very new to crypto and it shows  All his FUD has been known for many years  And its just that  FUD,416,35
No this argument is definitely different  For the longest time digital yuan argument was pretty much limited to a central banks ability to inflate the currency oooooo spooky Now its become readily apparent that as cryptocurrency technology has advanced  cbdcs value as currency is really the last in importance  What a cbdc will can afford is unprecedented control  an end to money laundering  thus denying important legitimate purchases like property and black market activities  more effective pushing of economic initiatives  especially in a planned economy  and political initiatives etc due to the data gathering these currencies will allow  Soooo ironic that technology invented to life the yoke of oppression from the haves will wind up instead tightening the noose on the have nots ,1,
This   and it s been audited and investigated and settled by NYAG   Not to mention if tether was actually collapsing all that money would flow into BTC crypto and pump the prices even more ,1,
 Alg Prei go find the channel crypto teacher,2,
 Alg Prei bitcoin lightning is ready   but kept back for the theatre to continue,1,
 ThePhilosopher it s the FEDERAL RESERVE  using  USDT and USDC to manipulate the stocks and the cryptos     FED has  50Billion  per day at disposal     for the real truths  find the crypto teacher channel     he explains it all,2,
 WhiteArtsMagic not sure that matters much since why would you use that energy for Btc if you could use thousands of times more electricity efficient cryptos and remaining electricity be left to light homes  The ecology is not the only problem  it s inefficient tech which can t scale and at the moment no solution is good enough or working ,3,
 Alg Prei 76  of all bitcoin mining is green,1,
 WhiteArtsMagic regulations will help crypto which passes their normative  BTC s red flag is energy consumption  it can t pass regulations ,1,
 Alg Prei Go watch InvestAnswers  Maybe this will change your mind  All this FUD has been around for many years  Do you know how many times china has banned bitcoin in the last 10 years  Regulations will only help crytpo  they are much needed actually ,1,
yeah  it was but how can you be sure it ll last much longer  Look at the crypto and world economy situation   regulations are coming  BTC is getting heat for being not ecologic  world economy as is crypto is in a bubble  Perfect time to pop it  Maybe it ll take some more months but the end is inevitable   propped crypto market with non ecologic crypto will pop hard ,2,
 Dr Tune I agree with you on this  The video showed the white paper from Tether claiming they only have 3  of the currency they re backed by while having Billions in value  Coupled with the charts that show BTC moving along with Tether and the fact they re in the BVI  Yea they re manipulating the markets ,6,
Cope,2,
You re all calling it FUD but you re not addressing the evidence,18,
There are rumours that several youtubers and twitter influencers etc have been pressured and or paid to spread FUD  We might have found another one of them ,7,
Lol weak hand please sell I need to buy more,5,
 Natriumcitrate55 he is just like that a sheep,2,
I guess he is paid to spread fud to his sheppy followers ,14,
The tether FUD is as old as 2017,9,
It worked  Weak hands are out  Now we can finally go back up  The fact that he is keeping Dogecoin absolutely invalidates the whole video,54,
Nice Fud  see you when Bitcoin reaches 100k    ,2,0

I bet you feel stupid now ,1,0
I was once swayed by this argument until I discovered that most banks only require 10  reserves  They don t ever anticipate the day everyone will want their money all at once  But the truth is  if every customer wanted to go to a bank  any bank  and take out all their money  the bank would collapse  Because they don t have the money ,2,0
Hahah  Tether just prints their stable coins    you mean just like the Fed prints funny money out of thin air      ,8,1
Just tell me what will happen if lets say the market crashes and people start liquidating tether  Will they be able to cash out or will tether collapse   If it does collapse then its worse than any FIAT and provides not real life benefit over them,1,
Hodl,1,0
I understand your hesitance with Tether  I think it s suss too and that makes sense  but why would that cause you to dump all of your BTC and other crypto except for Dodge coin when BTC is BTC and not USDT    Even if USDT became inert the money has already flowed into other cryptos  how would it affect them  It seems only people who hold large amounts of USDT  China institutions cough  would be holding a worthless coin if USDT is disassembled  The only thing is  people would simply have to convert to USDC or another Stablecoin since USDT isn t available ,1,0
Makes no sense ,1,
TechFUD,1,0
I guess when you look back in the next few months  you would have wonder why you ve made this decision   Tether has been having this issue since 2017 when I first knew about cryptocurrency  Simple  don t hold any Tether ,1,0

Guys he s not bashing crypto in general he s skeptical about usdt and I believe that usdt should be regulated so that no single organisation or individual should manipulate the market so efficiently ,1,0
In the US small banks must keep 3  in reserve and large banks must keep 10    Tether should be holding more in reserve particularly because of the volatility in crypto currency    However I would not expect them to keep 100  in reserve  a company needs to be able to make revenue to stay solvent ,1,0
If there s a run on exchanges they all turn insolvent where the first quarter of people get to cash out while the rest end up with nothing  you ll see,1,0

You misunderstand Bitcoin  Risking everything in buying  bitcoin is as an investment in something as an divestment in something  it is for  the future of the planet   Once you understand this   you will never sell your Bitcoin  All other Crypto is money hungry hypocrites  Bitcoin is not about getting rich   it is about making the poor rich with a beautiful peaceful world  I hope you buy Bitcoin again  I think You are a very courageous man   thank you,1,0

Bitcoin  and its forks  and altcoins have experienced a good amount of volatility  It s no different  this time around  BCH is currently tr diing sideways after registering a price correction  Nevertheless  the current dip serves as the perfect opportunity for traders because now s the time to acquire more assets  BT C and E T H are moving towards their worst weekly candle close of 2021  If the previous week is clubbed together  the losses are tragic  creating a significant sense of panic in the market  BTC  ETH were respectively down by  46  and  53   Hence  the case for a fractured bull cycle is becoming more evident and also both assets do not exhibit structural market strength at the moment  Both assets have not held positions above their supports  Right now  sliding strongly towards their low from May 19th  the sell off can be considered to be a reason for the invalidation of market supports  As Bitcoin is firmly driving the sentiment  the Alt markets are facing a similar decline  Though the m rket is not favorable and pr ces are down  this is a good opportunity to get more  ssets through buying the dip and also through profitable tr diing  I tr de daily with signals from Dr Tom  You can reach Dr Tom on   l       DrTom206   with his tr de slgnaI being copied in my tr des I have gotten over 12 bt c in profits   Dr Tom is an expert tr der and signal provider and he runs a program for less experienced tr ders looking to stay profitable in their tr des and I must commend his Tr de Courses as being insightful  broad and relatively easy to comprehend ,20,7

You re sharing an article that happened before the NY AG looked into them   I was also concerned about this item in the past and for sure it s got a shady company behind it  But you haven t researched this very well and so much of this has already been debunked   Binance and Binance US are different   The Bahamas bank has also responded to it and debunked the article you shared  The numbers they share for Bahamas aren t the whole story  ,10,1

The sell off will create another opportunity for the wealthy to buy up  crypto on the down low  This happens once the bleeding hits a high  point  The average investor will be just trying to keep from losing their entire investment  This also opens the door to a government regulated crypto which is exactly what the global elite want   Just remember all currency and commodities can and will be manipulated by those who create the markets  Think of it like a sadistic game of musical chairs with the three blind mice being played backwards ,1,0

Very well said  that part where its not popular to have paper hands   people want to pump btc and because of emotional ties to their positions  Thats when the logic goes out the window  The truth is crypto is done  its a fiat currency just like the dollar  And its weakness has been exposed  Its still a tradeable and profitable financial instrument but cryptos will never replace any  currency  Period  95  of these crypto fan boys and girls don t even know what the IMF SDR is  which is likely to be a global currency which will likely run on blockchain tech ,1,0

I didn t know Tether was that suspicious but I remember checking on Coin Market Cap one day and seeing Tether as the third most valuable coin and I was kind of taken back because I barely saw anyone talk about Tether  It actually makes a lot of sense that they re just creating them out of thin air and increasing market cap ,2,0
Tether is used to hedge by traders in between trades  Most of the volume from most markets come from traders market makers in this way,5,0

And what exactly do you think the United States Federal Reserve is doing   The US   which affects the globe as it s the global reserve currency  is backed by absolutely nothing     debt and taxes   It is a promissory note   Do you think all of the billionaires in the US could go and actually withdraw their dollars from a bank   Absolutely not    Bitcoin is the best form of money our species has ever seen  perhaps you should have educated yourself a bit more before apeing in ,1,0

Hypothetically  if I have 100Million in my bank account  and one day I decided to withdraw 99 million all at once  the bank might closed down due to liquidity problem  Same in crypto  it just copied the banking system but upgraded it and empowered people to decide  Basically  the middle man bank will be obsolete ,41,5
 Wandy Wexler Weslon no but they can t make something illegal   easily,1,
 Wandy Wexler Weslon government don t have interest in drugs  It s a real problem for all and they want to eradicate it too  Now government would have interest on tracking money activities on all its citizen  they would approve crypto but its came from their central bank invention  Do you think you can using bitcoin to buying thing as everyday usual  That s why most government in the world accept bitcoin just inside category of asset  not currency or money ,1,
 Griffith F K  More than  1T went out of the crypto market over the course of 2 weeks  That sounds a lot  It is a lot  No company filed for bankruptcy  no one died  Some overleveraged people  not managing their risk properly lost money  Good  Re start all and everything again  Buy the dip  Apes strong  fundamentals stronger    ,3,
Crypto holdings are vastly less liquid than real banks   you actually could wire out  100M and a big bank wouldn t bat an eye  let alone go bust  Companies engage in transactions that size all the time ,8,

Tether does seem rather shady tho may not have as much impact if institutional investors continue to adopt   The biggest risk is China banning all crypto mining as there is no country that can replace it affordably ,1,0

 They just print these thethers  print them out of nowhere and say   hey  each one of these is going to be worth a dollar   I guess he still doesn t believe in governments printing dollars    ,27,4
  Novica Vukobratovic okay well let s think about this for a second  Yeah sure the government prints money continuously  but they have a process and a specific reason for doing so  and are transparent about what they did  Sometimes they lie  and say it was for one reason but was actually for something else  Not only that  we know our government we know the people 6 run it we re familiar with them  Tether  they are literally some random person we have hardly ever seen or heard from  that are very secretive of their doings  operating in a country they can t be targeted in  So now tell me  who would you accept a million dollars from  The US govt in dollar bills  or USDT from tether  Keep in mind you re not able to exchange one for the other  You can buy bitcoin with either one  but you can t exchange it for the other currency ,2,
The dollar ia backed up by the most powerful military in the world ,5,
 Bryan Whelan Fiat is backed by nothing  if we are talking US dollars   IT used to be backed by gold  before they started infinitely printing it    On the other hand  Tether IS backed up by that document he presented in the video  you can read it there  but he never tried explaining other parts of the chart  other than the  cash  part of it    And they passed the checkup of them backing up Tether just fyi,6,
Fiat is backed by a government  Tether is backed by      ,6,
