Just imagine his son watches this video in a few years time  My dad didn t want to buy a house for us to live  My dad wants to live with his parents so he can save money  time and energy so my mom took me half way around the world  With the extra time and money my dad plays video games and brags about his money  Yep  Tech Lead is one smart cookie ,3,

Yea Patrick  you ve got a great set up  I wouldn t move either  In fact as two physicians  my partner and I are trying to finish residency training and move in with either of our parents  who also have similarly nice homes  customized over decades  We re not trying to re invent the wheel here ,1,1
      Extremely Point by point video Well I will also say this here  Most people don t understand the concept of  buying the dip  buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off when the  price rises just has the current markets is down   Holding is great  although trading is far more profitable   I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypt0 assets early enough  but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyze the digital market  all that changed when I encountered Mrs Michelle Rene Lucy services  I must confess it  was easier to understand with the assistance of  Michelle Rene   She is always one step ahead of other traders  she fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my funds   My earnings has increased from 2 BTC to 19 BTC in just 11 weeks and some days   I have full confidence in her tradin abilities  Mrs Michelle  can be reached oN WhatsApp      1 6 1 2  5 6 4 9 5 7 6   ,124,1

12 34 this is more or less the only serious part of the video  but it s such an important point  Crypto YouTubers are making tons of money whether the market is going up or down  There s nothing wrong with that  but if you re new to crypto you need to know that you re not playing the same game as them  If you make a bunch of bad investment decisions it can have serious consequences for you   but the big YouTubers will do just fine because of their 10  other income streams  sponsorships  ad revenue  pre sale invites  etc    ,2,0
I know deep down  through all that depressive and stupidly judging af face  he is actually an ordinary person who can appreciate things and know that everything happened to him is not because of some money he always complains about but his own mistakes    He is acting for just attention and youtube income  In reality  he just regrets for what happened with his ex and is trying to move on  ,1,1

A lot of people with high IQ s are terrible investors because they ve got terrible temperament   you need to keep raw  irrational emotions under control  ,1,
 I still see cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investment and i totally love the technology when it comes to the largest crypto asset Bitcoin  As a trader  i have been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to crypto and everyone has their opinions when it comes to choosing sides  though i am not kicking against Hodl  but i see it as an old and odd route  to make profit off the market as when the market goes bearish investors traders loses their investment which is always painful  when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trade alert from a professional trader that understand the market  to generate signals daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as i have been doing with Jason Brown for the past 5 weeks and i have been able to day trade to grow my initial 0 9 btc to 5 8 btc which you will rethink and see that trading is better profitable JASON daily advise are very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment profit JASON can be contacted via               Jason611  on how to trade profitably    ,31,4

REPORT TO FBI  illegal crimes on computers,1,
I m 30  I live with my parents   I own a small business and make more money than them   The stigma I get is really interesting  like I somehow failed or I m trapped     They are in their 60s and my Dad has poor health  I love my work and want to spend time with them until they die   I don t get why it s seen as bad ,43,8
 Tea Burn that s really sad  I m with you  Aging parents now and I would give up my solo live to be with them  How many more birthdays and Mother s Day you gonna get man  My solo life still has a long way to go later ,2,
It s seen as bad because you re being perceived as dependent and unattractive by the opposite sex  This Whole stigma is built on the sexual impulse of what is needed from a man to be perceived as a person to be dependent on  because as you know  your worth comes from what you offer to your lady   You re living t your parent s  just like when you were a kid  Nothing has changed  ergo you re still not a grown up   Your male peers may perceive you similarly  but only because they re judging you the same way they judge themselves  The stigma is 100  built to accumulate the needs of women to find a person with no package to get burdened with ,2,
No it s not bad  but eventually you will need someone to look after you too,2,
The channel successfully transitioned to comedy in the end    Techlead I m glad you re now living your dreams  as a millionaire ,1,2
It is unfortunate that Western Cultures push families apart by attaching negative stigma to anyone at home after a certain age  Generally by 18 or 22 if not in college  As kids are young and leave  they have to rent burning money  As parents age and unable to physically support themselves  they need assisted living burning money  Debt accumulated on the way in and out while dividing the family  Debt should have more of a stigma than family ,1,1

Was an insightful and pleasant video to watch ,1,0
This is quality trolling,4,0
Yo techlead  i think you should do a few episodes on getting LAID    Btw i don t really mean that as a snarky insulting joke at all  I feel like a lot of folks who follow you would cheer you on if you found a new relationship  even started another family   Wish you the best ,2,0
My life is very similar to the Tech Lead    But I am poor ,1,0

Techlead totally just got you in the thumbnail with his left hand ,2,0
I feel like this guy is joking about the perks of living with his parents but honestly it all kinda makes perfect sense to me  It s not like he couldn t afford to live alone  but why  Spend a bunch of money to be alone  It s crazy  I think he s doing the most sensible thing ,62,11
 Giotis Filopanos there s a third reason  If their parents are crazy  So you also have to enjoy being with them ,2,
 helloMr Nguyen I think  Taka Masuda hit the nail on the head  The only reason men choose to not live with their parents is so that they can attract women and or so that they can get a job in a different city country  If you don t care about that  and have a good job near your parents though  it makes total financial and emotional sense to live with them  give them money to help offset their expenses and focus on building your own wealth and career  Men would be a lot richer on average if they made choices based on what makes financial sense rather than chasing tail ,6,
Living with your parents is win win situation  Instead of paying stranger rent  Just give your money to your parents,2,
 Thomas Foolery pure wisdom in your words ,6,
That s why he s a  millionaire  ,1,
In our asian culture it s encouraged to live with your parents and take care of them and each other  Especially when you single ,12,

Congrats on your success  I d like to see you interact and talk with the homeless in California megapolises for a day  It will be fun and give attention to where is needed  And of course some analysis on the issue  Media always throws big budget plans in billions to tackle it but I never see the financial reports detailing how funds were spent and its spending efficiency per head ,1,0
This episode is so great  sarcasm mixed with some truth and TL showing bits of his non tech life  I especially love the part him petting his happy doggo   ,1,0

Hey  this is a really nice change from your regular content  Was really fun the watch ,4,0
Great episode,2,0
I guess techlead had to make a choice when fb asks him to choose YouTube or lose his 600k software engineer job  He chose YouTube  and now making also 600k per year  50 12   but with much freedom and less stress  I ll say he made a good but hard choice  not many can walk away from a 600k job  Congrats ,13,0
You could study metaphysics,1,0
Do you have hue colored light bulbs in every room though  That s an improvement ,2,0
Hi Techlead  mostly what I do to make it count  I would look at the clock and make a time window to do some urgent task  That sets up also some healthy pressure  Seems maybe stressfull at some times but it does help you to get through difficult task  One example is when I had to peel off shrimp before I needed to go visit a meeting   i am a chef  so mostly what i do is always plan ahead things and see if it is possible to tackle it in that time frame ,2,0

As a fellow millionaire  2x    no brag  just fact  I can really relate to this video  All of your friends have to earn a living while you try to entertain yourself all day  Instead of 2 dogs  and 3 ladders   I have 2 motorcycles and 4 ladders     but I am also 61  so he has time to catch up  Remember   becoming debt free is the most important investment of all  Learn to be content with little  Don t chase the things of this world    you can t take it with you,27,14

I m thinking if I didn t get married and have kids while living at home how much easier life would be   Actually my parents were not that cool to let me stay at home  however my girls can stay here as long as they like   Gots to love TechLead ,31,6
His parents are apparently successful as well  They are not the average Asian parents one might imagine  If I were TechLead I d be grateful for them tbh,2,
Actually as an Asian  I believe my parents will give me an extremely hard time had I been divorced by my spouse and couldn t see my kid s  if I were a successful guy like him  I imagine my parents forcing me to date more women and have more kids ,1,
i think its a western culture   most asian parents are cool staying at their side even though your an adult and have a job and even when you got married and have kids  I know this im asian we just love family sticking together  When they got old you take care of your parents not just throwing them in an Home for the Ages,3,

I feel like having a lot of money really hasn t that much utility in the 21st century  If you are living in a 1st world country  and make reasonable money   70k a year ,5,10
The utility of a lot of money is the freedom to control your time  Your time is the most finite resource you have  you only have so many days in your life ,1,
The  utility  of having a lot of money is to not  have to  go to work every day earning your living for the month again and again  It s about being free to choose what you want to do with all of your days  EVEN if you d choose to go back to work it would still be worth it   for the freedom ,1,
This is so funny    OMG  tons of people not getting the joke here    This is the story of every crypto YouTuber ever    Even without crypto  he s already a millionaire with tech and his app business    Can t you see he s mocking those crypto YouTubers   ,5,0

Calvin Something I think you have oversimplified and things are easier said than done  Could you give real life examples  We are living in a thankless society and every spent time with others is just a transaction equating to money to your services ,1,
 jukester 003 correct  but l am just going to do my little part of helping the world even if it is not recognized  because every lit bit helps  ,1,
 susan wolf have you even watched the video  What if life has no meaning and is just a chaos ,1,
These replies are so depressing  Not sure if people are portraying the incel archetype ironically or sincerely ,4,
susan wolf I have been on that path before and been optimistic what I can do to society  Unfortunately  you have to be in an influential positions to make a difference  A lot of people with good intentions struggle to be in that place while you see people who didn t earn that title because they were there for some other s interest ,1,
You can be a little less selfish and try to do some services for humanity  that ultimately help you and the world l don t mean any disrespect  but life without doing any good for others is not healthy or productive  ,3,
