Now you started Including videos in your videos to spread hatred against some kind of people based on their culture clothes   how do you feel if someone starts bringing in some of the bad videos about asians and use them as proof to spread hatred against Asians  Thats what you re doind now  You should take Down this video  and take off those parts of videos you included  2 times at 5 30 and 10 00  since you include it 2 times that tells a lot about your subconscious  now i see that you re a racist,1,

 I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like mr Chen lawrence  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 9 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy  You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM    chentrading1,2,0

Well explained  BTChits another bearish cost as individuals expanded their offers in order to make immense addition from the ascent however as we would all be able to see now the market is truly insecure   truly you can generally make more benefit from tradn instead of just hodlin and sitting tight at the cost of BTCto soar   Surely its an extreme choice for both old and beginners whose intensions are simply to hodl and sell yet rather the possibilities of tradnBtc would permit you develop yourBtc not disapproving of the current value graph and furthermore saving your butt from any future profound that may happen   I began tradn with Larry Robinson since toward the end of last year and till date have made over 16Btc even with the high points and low points since the excursion  With Larry s assistance I presently don t need to stress over the ascent and plunge ofBitcoin  you can without much of a stretch get to Larry on   l        Robinson Trade12    for any Crypot related issue ,7,10

I love that you said the ugly truth the crypto nerds don t want to acknowledge   Most people investing don t care at all about the technology   it s all speculative bs   We just watch to see what s the smart play by doing our dd reading stuff on the internet and watching YouTube videos of analysts and invest to make                Not cuz we care about tech we don t it s just making  ,1,0

I like your videos  but whenever you talk about Vitalik you put words in his mouth  Would be preferable if you actually just quoted him exactly ,1,0
hahahaha I am dying   this is such a harsh video   I am so happy I found this channel XD,1,1
The is like one of the funniest  best  and most informative videos I ve seen on here  Also  Cardano for the win ,3,1
this video is biased and make me vomit  the video clip is out of context  like the one for NFT  vitalik said he was amazed by how it evolved since he underrated it before  also psychological and unreasonable behavior are just a real  big challenge that is a limit of current research methods  in internet development  it was the algorithm first implemented and after several years the proof comes out  also sharding here has almost nothing to do with multi chain bifurcation  but i am not a believer in vitalik  just most of his saying accidentally seem to be make sense to me    not sure what s this video s purpose ,1,1
For the many viewers here who are new to crypto  I highly recommend you listen to the FULL podcast before passing judgments about Vitalik Buterin   TechLead s outright defamation of him is truly regrettable   ,4,0
Hmm TechLead s sarcasm has slowly turned to craftly lies  these recent videos is truly a new low,1,0

I would love to see Cardano win  because I own a lot more of them   but I think Eth will probably outperform it by a mile  I guess we ll know after the switch to Eth 2 0 what will be most likely  Right now  it just seems like Eth has a lot more name recognition and mass market support ,2,0
All I heard was buy both  ,1,0
Oh my God  why does Buterin have to have a lisp ,2,0
Just great   ,2,0
Value progress over perfection  The main question is has Ethereum constantly shipped an MVP  Perhaps in the long run Cardano may become more valuable but I believe Eth will still lead in the areas of innovation and sustaining the essence of the blockchain    decentralization ,1,0

OMG     your videos keep getting more and more entertaining     Although I ve never been interested in bitcoin  you make the topic so engaging     and hilarious        ,1,0
We ll have Ethereum Classic  Ethereum 1 0 Less Classic  and Ethereum 2 0 Hopium by 2025  C H  is just as cringe and sounds like another narcissistic liar  Selling  research based  blockchain tech that noone can tell what  are the differentiations from another fork and do nothing other than staking making ponzi money generated solely from leverage trading activities  I do own Ethereum  but clearly I am supporting for more cultist pump so I can exit with 10x leaving you all holding bags ,1,1
is it even legal to roast this hard    ,3,1
Isnt cardano built on eth  They have a 99  correlation right now,1,2
So essentially  ETH is great for speculators who will see their money go brrrr   or vanish  Meanwhile Cardano being so methodical  that it will actually take years to grow  It has low chance of vanishing  but it also has low chance of making millionaires out of nothing ,17,4
lol no   the  methodical  method cardano follows is not how innovation in tech has like  ever played out  it s a dated model based on the idea of academic rigor from a bygone era that has been lapped several times in several industries fields  it s telling that ADA has no deployment still while the entire defi space is dominated by ETH   cardano is far more speculative than ether because ether actually     gets used  do you understand what speculation means ,1,
Yea it s not about making millionaires  It s about the long term tech  Why all the dev building everything on eth is foolish ,1,
wow  a lot of new clips and actual editing in today s video  Nice,3,1
My favorite type of tech lead content  where he says completely absurd stuff with a straight face,50,6
 Zenchess I mean didn t Vitalik actually say that lol,1,
i don t really think what he said was absurd  it s just we live in an absurd world where some digital token without any value was somehow accepted as digital gold,2,

This gave me RMS vs Linus vibes from the get go ,5,0
Ethereum and Cardano are both kind of scammy  They both profit from over promising and under delivering  the longer it takes for them to deliver it  the more profitable it is for them  There are only very few cryptocurrencies that under promise and over deliver  but Ethereum is much more legit than Cardano  at least Ethereum has working DeFi  while Cardano still doesn t  So  Polygon is kind of like Ethereum  not great  but also not terrible ,1,0
Half of the time it s roasting himself xD true comedian,11,0
There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a pre pubescent immature nerd     I just bought a 1973 mint  Captain Fantastic  pinball machine and am planning to spend the evening with a burger and fries  a classic glass bottle of cola    and loud 60 s music  visualizing a diner on Route 66 in the mid 70 s with a sexy waitress bringing me my meal in a red plastic burger basket lined with wax paper    setting it on the play field of the machine  smiling  as I deposit my first quarter from the coin roll  Yes  a Holodeck experience    in 2021  Cheers ,1,0

Techlead  Charls said for Vitalik he is immature Charls  Vitalik changed a lot  not the same person  he is more mature,83,2
Actually the whole video is full of this type of manipulations  Like  in the uncut interview Buterin had a positive comment on Ada founder   about Polygon projects  etc    That guy is taking viewers for idiots  Even the title makes no sense  who declared war at who  nobody at all ,1,
Underhanded way of saying still not mature enough ,12,
when will TechLead release the  TECH token and put an end to all of this   as a millionaire ,73,3
 Ren  indeed,2,
He listened to you   ,4,
lol Charles seemed a bit drunk honestly haha,2,1
Funny man  I was beginning to get bored with your bear vibes on crypto  but this is the content I ve been hoping going for        Thanks so much   You re doing great ,1,1

Ironic that they Charles would compaire ethereum to a rocketship that could blow up when after the last major update the Cardano network froze for hours ,1,0
That was mental   but I resubscribed because I like Cardano ,2,0

Dude  your content quality just went brrrrrrrr     We are here for the money   ,2,0
Hoskins  imo  is doing this the right way  Dotting the i s and crossing the t s when it comes to the technology  safety  and viability of his cardano platform  Where as ethereum has great technology up to a certain point with serious flaws  and it s the second most popular coin  based mostly on time and exposure in the space  I believe  ethereum and vitaliks flaws will be the reason for ethereum being flipped by Cardano  polkadot  ripple  etc    but like you said  most people in this space dont care about what the technology is  we are here to make money  People will put their money in what they think is valuable  people love bitcoin  so they will put their money in that  Me  I put my money in the project  the leadership  and the use case of a platform coin  I think 5 years from now  unless bitcoin and ethereum clean up their flaws and or are used as store of value  I just see people pouring money into better more efficient projects  use case  with faster transactions  lower fees  and eco friendly coins  Those are my thoughts ,16,1
The counter argument is  Hoskins is doing the right thing by researching on problem that that other cryptos are experiencing in the real world   There are just problem that you cannot anticipate without putting in real world for test    Just like SpaceX s starship  you can only theorize and simulate so much  putting a prototype starship out to test and the best test ,1,
eth and cardano dont scale  bsv can do everything eth and cardano can  and then some  bsv is the only real bitcoin that scales for billions of ppl ,1,0
How did Vitalik think calling it  sharting  was a good idea    ,2,1
Probably Cardano is going to win  I mean You Cannot innovate in medicine   far less even crate a personal training program without Peer Reviewed studies   In that sense  it could be a bit naive to believe You Can build the futures digital economy without mathematical Proof and 3rd party validation of the code    thats simply too risky   So either they Will have to adopt Cardanos approach or Cardano  ADA   Will be the preferred choice for B2B implementation   much more government adoption ,2,0
TechLead became a referee  as a millionaire ,1,0
Definitely a real beef between these tweebs  Your descriptions of the two made me laugh big time ,8,0
Great vid  One argument  11 47 Hoskinson said in his last video  he wants to create a Decentralized A I  similar to Vitalik s vision of placing consciousness on the blockchain  Only it will be everyone s consciousness in essence ,3,9
 James Staker  PulseChain   Hex  if you study the gut micro biome you ll eventually figure out that our biome vastly influences  or controls how we think  It does this through the enteric nervous system and the vagus nerve and the gut brain axis   You ll eventually figure out that how we think and our consciousness  without a doubt  resides there in the 100 trillion microbial organisms that populate it ,1,
Except neuroscience has never been able to identify consciousness or where it resides  Namely because they look in the brain when it resides in the intestines ,2,

It was hilarious,1,
Agreed ,1,
TL is getting better and better ,3,

So you are saying a college dropout does not have mathematical riguor  it is not our fault that you where insecure and payed an old man to teach you things people discovered alone thru the  past of years,2,1
Could be  or maybe he is just trolling    Anyway  Vitalik gives the impression he discards academic on favor of his heuristics  I mean academic riguor can consider those heuristics  what does Ethereum have better then Cardano  ,1,

 RuskiVodka Yup  Same happened in 2017  And also quite bit in 2013  But it seems to last longer each time  So one day it will just be a continuous stream of hype and cult like behaviour ,2,

 Ren  Souza I agree ,1,
What the co founder of Eth doesn t realize is no one cares ,1,
Problem is  for the people who can name 3 cryptos  they don t know what cardano is ,2,
 J D i am sure you didnt form this opinion yourself clearly biased,3,
Yeah he doesn t deserve any credit for ethereum  he basically just tried to create a foundation to cash in then a coin to try and split the community later on  and now another coin to cash in again ,3,
Techlead will never miss an opportunity to put ex something in the title xD,11,
jesus the whole crypto community really has become one massive cult this year   ,20,
Well  too bad for him ,12,

I love his humor it s fucking hilarious  I think many people dont realize he s being sarcastic half the time,8,
They both said each other mattured  but you phrased it as they both said each other were immature  you are stiring the pot intentionally  As someone who watched the full interview and finished it an hour ago the way you portray Vitalik Buterin in this video is super disingenuous Im in favour of Cardano  but people like you really use misinformation and mischaracterisation to get people to side with you because you are financially invested  Its very black and white,2,1
