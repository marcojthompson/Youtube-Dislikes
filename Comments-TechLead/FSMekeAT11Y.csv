Just like the same as fees to buy gold and silver bullion   The small and moderate investor never wins   I hold some gold bullion and silver bullion coins just as part of my insurance if the economy  grid  or social order goes to sh t   I have food reserves and water reserves and just enough guns to hold and defend but do stock ammo   I am retired and am just sitting and waiting   We will see   my wealth is just numbers in a computer and paper money can become useless in a day and all my wealth can be wiped out with a key stroke in a computer or a total infrastructure collapse   So I just sit and wait   Just saying ,1,1

Bitcoin is NOT digital gold  Gold does not  1  Leave a permanent record of every single transaction involving gold  2  Vanish into the void permanently because you lost access to your cryptographic gold keys  3  Carry to potential of becoming absolutely worthless if people stop mining gold  4  Become exponentially more expensive to mine the more of it has been mined  5  Fluctuate massively in price in very short periods of time      sure I could think of other differences but 5 should make the point  Bitcoin is a digital gambling instrument with millions of idiots all playing chicken for keeps ,1,0

He is Right    Like other videos he has made there is sarcasm as well as facts    I am currently  invested  in cryptocurrencies right now    But I think he is 100  accurate on catching a falling knife    I listen to other people s technical analysis and charts blah blah blah    And the truth is nobody can predict the bottom because I keep buying the dip and the dip dips    ALL investments are speculative    And lately even the stock market seems to me just like gambling    At least when I buy alcohol I know what I m getting    LOL,1,0

He s right on fees  Sometime ago I thought I ll sell my ethereum  when it goes up and buy back when cheaper and I ll do this over and over  I sold my ethereum which cost me  200 then I bought it back which cost me  200 so I was out  400 in a couple days  I was like bad experiment   then I switched it to Bitcoin at a huge fee then went back at a huge fee  At that point I thought to myself how do I start an exchange  They are the ones making all the money ,1,1

Using crypto cash to pay for goods and services  both online and in person has the potential to revolutionize the way we use money on a day to day basis  Additionally  trading and investing in cryptocurrency can be lucrative and rewarding  providing the potential for high ROI thanks to how insulated the digital currency market is to conditions that would otherwise throw a wrench into a Forex or binary options exchange  That being said  using crypto in everyday transactions or crypto investing and trading is not foolproof  It often requires specialized knowledge to navigate the sometimes murky waters of the underlying technology  and crypto exchanges are subject to their own unique market conditions that may be inscrutable to the uninitiated  However  cryptocurrency is undergoing rampant growth in both popularity and use  It won t be long before major banking systems begin using adapted versions of blockchain technology to make electronic payments in fiat currency  Soon  even the most conservative financial advisors will begin recommending incorporating some cryptocoin into your investment portfolio  It s likely there will always be a place for physical money  Cold  hard cash is hard to beat  and in situations where there s no access to technology  it s still the only game in town  The rules of the game are rapidly changing  though  and cryptocurrency is one player that s not leaving anytime soon  that is why we recommend amateur trader to have a mentor and someone who trade for them with this you have an Eighty Eight percentage return  I recommend Alvin  lfred because he is the real deal when it comes to trading and learn new skills in the Crypto world  you can reach him on T E L E G R A M     lvincryptotrading   W H A Ts A P P  1 516 882 3859   Thank me Later     ,31,4

Man I used to have respect for your insight cause I thought you were a rational  logical thinker   5 45  But you just called out the statement   if you dont buy crypto  you won t get rich  a logical fallacy  Which is insanely stupid when your next argument is literally a logical fallacy  Your next argument  you just arbitrarily state  buying crypto is pretty much gambling and then proceed to support your statement by saying  the house always wins      Do you not see the logical fallacy in your argument right after you called out a logical fallacy ,1,0

Very valid points  It s imaginary money  However so is the US dollar  But it is supported by an evil government that has a huge military  So you really do have a lot of good points however I have made a lot of money off of crypto and now I am cautiously continuing to make more I don t have as much money in the game now it s looking kind of sketchy but I m always looking for opportunities,1,1

  TC price is prone to volatile swings  making it historically popular for traders to speculate on    According to bitcoin halving cycles  there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run  so  if  the PI indicator  and Bitcoin  might repeat a similar bull  run to 2013  That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year  lnvestors and traders find it difficult to decide how best to utilise the current market   hodling is profitable but tradlng is far more profitable   I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough  I didn t think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Mark Murray s program for lnvestors newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng B TC works  to help them stack up more Bit      since late last year till date I have made over 19 TC from 2 6 TC with Mark s help  You can easily get to him           markmurray or                1  8 32 4 13 23 74,226,7

Crypto itself is not legalized gambling  the payment processors are just skimming an insane amount of money off the top if you try to convert your crypto back into fiat  which in some ways makes sense  Coinbase allows you to trade between cryptos without any fees actually  The fees itself are what add liquidity to the crypto  making it worth anything at all  It should be expensive for someone to enter a market  try to make huge gains from others losses  and exit  That would essentially allow anyone  with enough money to collapse the entire market  You re not supposed to enter crypto to make a huge profit off of others  but to truly have a decentralized currency  You enter crypto because you believe in it  Crypto does not reward those who are using it as a tool to  get rich quick ,1,1

Investing in bitcoin and cryptocurrency is the best way to make earnings due to the recent outbreak  Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing  we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly  One reason you need to invest in crypto and its technology is because  crypto is changing the economy shape of any nation that approaches the technology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late  While looking at the growth rate of cryptocurrency and the opportunity it presents  why not look into it and have a rethink about the particular investment you wish to make now  Day trading is one of the easiest way to earn good money but it needs a lot of your time to analyze the market trend and make the right decision according to that trend  Get an expert like Mr Jorge ken whose daily signals and strategy is top notch  With his strategy and daily signals  i was able to grow my portfolio from 2 1btc to 5 3BTC which you can agree is a great profits  Ethan   can be reached on             jorgeken6 ,50,9

Bitcoin has ping ponged back and forth over recent trading sessions in search of its next big move  The cryptocurrency now looks coiled into a tightly wound spring as BTC USD price action fluctuates between two converging trendlines  This brings to focus potential for Bitcoin volatility to accelerate following a breakout from the pennant pattern that appears to have formed  tcoin bulls and bears have been clashing over where the crypto heads next as price action consolidates following a  50  selloff from all time highs  A string of higher lows are forming from rebound efforts off the  30 000 price level  but this is mired by consecutively lower highs amid prevailing downward pressure  As such  it is worth keeping in mind that one distinct characteristic of a pennant pattern is the  flagpole  that precedes the pennant  It is also important to remember this chart pattern  generally speaking  indicates strong potential for a continuation of the recent trend  i e  direction of the flagpole  Am not an expert or a pro b t co n  r   r but am a prof table one because I copy  r    with Vincente Sanz s  r    calls  and I have been able to increase my portf0l o from 2 b t c to 6  in just about six months  Employing the services of a  r       n   provider definitely have its perks depending on how accurate the  r       n  S are and I can attest to the accuracy of Mr  Vincente s  r    calls  He can be reached on       vicentesanzofficial gmailcom  and             44  7380 353818  for more inquiries into his  r        n   services    ,26,10

great post   I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  She believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Robin Moore  She is always one step ahead of other traders  she fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 05 BTC to 6 702 BTC in just 4 weeks using her strategy  You can easily get hold of her for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM  moorerobin  and What s   application 1  213   262 7458    ,2,2

PREACH,1,1
lol,1,1
Told you    ,1,1
Okay  obviously at this point you are just mocking up everybody  Assuming that you actually own bitcoin  It s clear that you didn t sell it  You just used that as a topic for your las video just to then comeback to make this video now  What a waste of time  Plus  to make it even worse  you are actually making people out there panic and potentially lose a lot of money by selling their positions after watching your videos  What a shame ,1,1
clearly hopped on the bitcoin trend for clickbaits  and dammit i fell for it this time  respect   btw its fine  btc will drop lower than 30k anyway so u allg ,2,0
why didnt you explain about the bitocoin halving event every 4 years    its not a coincidence that the price recover every halving event including the 70 80  correction and hundred percent gain afterward  its really predictable,2,2
Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list  in some months time you ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today,20,16

Just your title cracked me up   and you say you never joke  You are hilarious   Seriously  you make good points about the fees that is the reason ETF with a fixed 9 95  transaction fee is interesting  The downfall with Bitcoin ETF is that you are missing all the evening  night and week end action ,1,0
Yes  that means you actually need to trade well to make a profit,2,0
This is so bipolar,1,0
Nice update   By the start of this week s trading session  moving between losses and gains on its neutral weekly outlook which makes it a tough decision for investors to decide how best to utilise the current market  as for me it can t be more obvious that trading Bitcoin is way more lucrative than just hodlng and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket  I didn t think it was possible to make constant win from trading till I came across Edward James program for investors newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works  to help them recover loss from the crash and also stack up more bitcoin  since January till date I have made over 19 BTC from 2 6 Btc with Edward s help  You can easily get to him on           Edwardjames022  be guided ,67,7
Actually it s the money that you lost that is now feeding my gains  Thanks for the free profits  Crypto even now is still so underrated  You just have to follow prices and buy the dip instead of buying at all time highs ,4,1
TechLead is a great reverse indicator,1,0
Yeah It s very fee heavy  not a good time,1,0
Thanks for selling me your Bitcoin last week at 33k ,1,1

I knew this was going to happen  I was very surprised when he sold  Never take the technical analysis 100   it doesn t always work out ,2,0

Key difference between bitcoin and other alts  bitcoin ownership is decentralized enough so there is no risk of rug pull  That and bitcoiners are actually loyal to their cause and beliefs  hence 80  did not sell during last bear   Altcoiners are hustlers  they aren t true believers  Hence theres no demand in a bear market ,1,0

I told you TechLead  Well  this will be my last appearance  Hold to the fundamentals  It seems you are becoming an expert  I follow you though  Take care ,1,0
well said ,1,0
The TechLead can provide fresh perspectives on some of the blockchain projects out there  Focusing on the ones that may best utilize blockchain technology and bring investors  next gen venture capitalists   along for a mutually beneficial ride  Some of these coin market cycles may even start decoupling from the Bitcoin cycle so that may help to keep things interesting ,3,1
There s no other cycles besides the Bitcoin cycles  All other coins are shitcoins created in its image  The whole metaphor is that Bitcoin is like the gold standard and everything else is pegged to it ,2,
Yes  Coinbase fees are outrageous    That s why you shouldn t use Coinbase   And  you won t end up paying fees if you don t panic sell like a noob   ,1,0
Loved this video  Definitely among one of his top videos  Jam packed with sound info to consider ,2,0
 There is always a bull market somewhere      Jim Cramer,28,1
Just do the opposite of what Jim Cramer says and you will do fine financially,2,
I think you are right  this is just a lull before the next leg down   Bitcoin could go down to 20K or even 10K before starting another rally over 50K    You really have to be a real longterm trader that can take the huge downturns in stride and not panic out in order to actually make money on crypto  most people can t handle that  including myself  Coinbase charges a lot for a trade  I was really surprised when I used it ,5,0
The monotonous sarcasm is hilarious ,76,0

And there s upsale of  30 000 course down the line  because guaranteed that they are still not sure how to get there ,1,
I could tell you re a  buy and hold  type a k a a position trader  coins are very volatile and to avoid your emotions getting the best of you is to look at all times frames mostly monthly  weekly and daily charts as they are the best when coming to the direction of the market  and also what I have learnt for the past 3   years about coins is that they behave much more like indices and some commodities  Nikkie  Gas  oil etc  so I suggest you look into gap trading and also look for a broker that offers better reliable trading platform where you can clearly see gaps  I recommend TradingView  you can use their platform solely for chart analysis and use your current broker for entries and exits    I hope it helps,1,0

I knew this video will actually come but I didn t thought it will come this soon  There you have it  The king of selling low and buying high  as a millionaire   Ok I m done  But let me just give you one little piece of advice  In crypto doing nothing is the most difficult task  Holding a bag of something that may loose half it s value now but maybe do a 3x 2 months later takes a resilience  And conviction ,1,0
I only continue to follow this channel because sometimes it s useful to see the government boot licking normie perspective on crypto,2,1

meh   just cause bitcoin came out of Memorial Day weekend relatively flat  doesn t change any of the valid shortcomings you had brought up on the bitcoin in your past several videos   I don t see it as a viable storage of value  not digital gold   It s digital fool s gold   It s completely arbitrary   not asset at all   I m not plugged into the Matrix ,2,1
I actually liked this one  Good point on the fees and overtrading ,57,5
It s actually amazing how low the fees are if you just hodl rather than sell and buy back in repeatedly,2,
Is ths just America where they pay you for using credit cards ,2,
Ur a joke at this point,1,1
I ve made a fortune off crypto  more than 100k or 200k   There are major 20    30  swings  and by using technical analysis and holding for 6   20 hours a day  I can normally exit with 10   20  gains  Look at ETH on the 1 hr  daily  I held all the way from 2227 to  2450   when it showed a sign of weakness at  2463  I exited when it went down to 2450  That s a 10  movement  with 0 004  fees all together for maker and taker fees  I  held for 11 hours  I used Fibonacci to measure the low  and used the ascending triangle pattern to measure that the next low would be 2200    2300 area  I saw the first consolidation  and entered at 2288  and exited after 21 hours  with naps in between and some anime  at  2660  That s a 16  movement  That s over the course of 3 days  The volatility can be dangerous  but if you don t be greedy by holding for too long  you can normally get away with pretty large gains  If you want to hold and someday hope for 10 000  like dogecoin or MATIC polygon  that s fine but I trade with crypto  I make comfortable gains  and then I run away  Some people would love a 5  gain overall by holding in the stock market  but I outperform the stock market all day by trading in positions of strength in crypto ,2,3

Have you seen the Coinbase ads out there    If you had bought Bitcoin  you d be a millionaire    Crypto really appeals to the addictive gambler personalities out there  especially in economic hard times   With all of the hidden fees and naive promises of gold  it s concerning   Let s just hope this rocket ship is really going to the moon  as so many believe ,6,

You all are focusing short term  Buy and hold so simple and yet so difficult concept to some people ,3,3
That s true  I didn t figure it 4 years ago sadly  but now I know that I MUST hold  Yet it s so difficult to just chill and not look at the chart  even when it s going up  ,2,
The best investment in the last 10 years was HODL and chill      Naval,17,2

To me Michael Saylor makes more sense than this status quo pessimism  Admittedly I m a Bitcoin BTC maxi till 2024 2028 time horizon  Dollar cost average instead of knife catching ,1,1
I know that you re making these crypto videos as they re getting you a lot of views  I like yours more than other s as you seem calm and calculated about them and your logic makes sense   Can you make a video about your thoughts on fundamental valuation of crypto  Especially the ones that are not BTC or ETH as I consider those two as options to play in the casino with all the SHT coins   You made a video about ADA   about their projects  etc  I get it all  but in the end  why would success of any of their projects increase the value of ADA in any way  It s not like your stake is somehow in any way tied to their future revenues or profits ,1,6
You won t get an answer to that  lol  I always asked the same question  The only business and value they can sell is transaction speed  the rest is bs  BTC is the only one that has some kind of store value  the rest is sh   the cryptos with best marketing are pumped by btc  that s all  There is no real trilion value there in crypto  at least in alts  The real value in a business are goods and services  and if you ask the crypto fanatics what services worth of trilions are these coins selling  you will get no answer  or some fast transaction and bs answer  People talk about Ada and xrp and pumping it up with their own money  while the founders have hundreds of millions of dollars  owning large   of the cryptos  It is all a joke  If you are smart and make some money  great  but the real value is much smaller then what they sell you ,1,

 Shane why would he buy back in  I seen his one video and he sounded pretty sure its going to 0 lmao  on a side note why would a woman ever leave a guy with this much personality ,3,
 Shane it would not be so cool when tech lead receive his tax bill at 45  for short term cap gain tax for federal and state as a millionaire in California   That profit on short term trades after tax does not look so much better than simply holding anymore     ,3,

   The more the price falls  the more comparisons will be drawn to the Great Crypto Crash of 2017 18  It may be a bit early for the four year cycle to be coming to an end  but the level it has fallen is now very familiar  More than half of bitcoin s value has now been wiped away since its all time high in mid April  Cryptocurrency prices are at their lowest since the start of the year  While some are cashing out in case it falls further  others are hoping this might be a great buying opportunity I advise people not to hold  I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough  I didn t think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across Marcus Murphy s program for lnvestors newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng crypt0 works  to help them stack up more Bit      since late last year till date I have made over 19 TC from 2 6 TC with Marcus s help                2   4  0   6  1  7   2   9  0 4                 Marcusmurphy1      ,36,9

This techlead guy is pulling some next level satire  kinda genious i must say,476,15
 Teemu Vesala he s doing meta humor  where it s jokes and serious at the same time  and sometimes he gives really good advice  such as  full ownership ,2,
 Teemu Vesala everyone got baited from the title   expected him to feel deep regret over selling   The damage control is all I am pointing out,1,
 TheGohthecrow Poor guy  you can t see TechLead is doing satire  The whole channel is about trolling ,1,
Yup  He does everything for a reason  it s pretty hilarious  he does have some great dry comedy skills that he should pursue ,3,
yeah he is smart and here we have people taking him seriously lmao,2,
Agreed  he s got me rolling  ,1,
He is good at it  lol,4,
He should change his channel name to  Crypto Lead ,15,
Oof  someone is mad mad about their crypto     ,10,

This is my favorite comedy crypto channel ,1197,53
I was looking for THIS comment,2,
 P D I wouldn t waste your breath   They re all hodling millions and borrowing money on their stash which can only go up   According to them   No regulation is great until your trading account is frozen  you can t sell when you need to  when the fees are ridiculous and the spread is crippling   If any of these guys have anything at all in 5 years I ll be amazed and eat my words but I ll bet they only have words to eat and nothing to buy food or pay rent with ,1,
 B M wrong  Fiat currency is backed by nothing  Bitcoin is backed by the largest most secure network on the planet ,1,

 Frank Seliger   the path for Bitcoin to  0 is much short than the path for Bitcoin to  100k      Math matters ,1,
 P D You are completly wrong on your data  Just Google it  don t be lazy  I m not going to waste time educating You ,1,
Why is it comedy  Coz he s calling out your shillers ,2,
 P D crypto is too big fail also  few countries have tried to ban bitcoin  I say tried because people on those countries still use it via vpn  What You are saying is not going to happen   Being against crypto  is being on the wrong side of history   It s like being against cars or internet when those technologies were invented ,2,
 P D low iq    bitcoin is going to 100k  average iq    bitcoin is going to zero  high iq    bitcoin is going to 100k   the famous bell curve  anyways  the panic selling and stating that bitcoin is going to zero after 11 years of thousands of people saying the exact same thing just to have their apocaliptic predictions smashes is not high iq,2,

 Globetrotter 4FR Dude literally sold his crypto before the 50  drop   Your investment dropped by 50  while his didnt   Keep hating lmao,3,
 Globetrotter 4FR  He is going down the crypto rabbit hole like everyone who gets into crypto  Hopefully he ll start playing with the technology and put his biases to the side to figure out better solutions for programming digital assets or tokenize real world products ,1,
he shorted BTC so he is in the red,1,
If he s holding bitcoin still and he tells people to sell  the price of bitcoin would drop  meaning he would lose money  Sure he could buy more  but that s like buying a stock that s plummeting ,3,
Sentiments towards crypto portfolios have started getting sour,1,1
thanks for the buying opportunity   ,9,1
Earth to TechLead  a MAJOR Appeal of Bitcoin is NOT that it s digital    it s BECAUSE it s NOT officially sanctioned and controlled by any one nation   ,6,3
The irony is that no one will take it seriously until it is officially sanctioned and controlled by governments    and then it ll be pointless and even less worth using than it is today ,5,
