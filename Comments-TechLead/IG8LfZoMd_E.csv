B tcoin s fall to the perilous support of  30K has made lnvestors increasingly cautious  and warnings of a bearish force are already beginning to emerge even if the markets have already lost almost 50  of their total capitalization since the ATH just 3 months ago  Among the bearish voices   a seasoned investor known for managing the Prudent Bear fund until he sold it in the midst of the 2008 crisis  In addition to this   Dogecoin trading volumes soared 1 250  in the second quarter of the year on the world s major crypt0currency exchanges   according to figures compiled by Coinbase and published by Markets Insider  What s more  the average trading volume of DOGE surged to  995 million per day from April to June  having traded around  74 million a day in the first quarter  This rise doesn t come as a total surprise mainly because of two crucial factors  as well as DOGE s listings on major exchanges  DOGE has been trending in the developmental aspect as well  Not so long ago  developer Patrick Lodder introduced two proposals  the first of which adds utility based features akin to those included in other blockchains such as Bitcoin  The second proposal relating to transaction fees will reduce the average fee by 99   among other things  Through these  Dogeco n will also incorporate the segregated  feature  I m not a pro trader but I was lucky to make enough  since  late last year following the instructions and the best signals of Mr Gabriel Moore   Delivering a simple user experience has been Mr Gabriel s goal since day one  so naturally it s something we have focused on  With his expertise and experience in this field and with their daily trade signals you will increase your portfolio like never before because I am a living testimony to this  in just three month of investing with Gabriel Moore trade signals  and utilising his trade strategies I have gained about 5 btc  Gabriel moore has his free courses on google that can help you get started if you are a newbie and you can reach this pro trader and coach via gm il  gabrielmooreofficial gmailcom  or what sApp    1  361  249 0832 for any further inquiry strictly on crypto trading with great results,28,10

Very nice and educative video i must say   From a technical point of view of cryptocurrency  the RSI looks promising in favor of the bulls  as the daily RSI is at the bullish territory above 50  after reversing earlier today   At the same time  the Stochastic RSI oscillator is about to make a bullish crossover at the oversold area  In case this happens  it might assist the market in reaching higher highs  Lots of folks will do so well in the next bull market but you shouldn t be of the mindset to only hodl  can be very dangerous  As hard as it is  rad  g Crypto  it sure is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just learn   pay attention to what s going on  I m not a pro   ad   but I was lucky enough to make 120k usd btc worth since late last year following the instructions and s  nals from  results  Mike Nigel  He runs program for the best group who can help and let you know how   rad  g crypto works  helping them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stacking up more bitcoin  You can easily get to them on insta qram   Kelvin1uptrades    ,1,0

My sense regarding cryptos  meme stocks and get rich quick schemes by those fake gurus is that these are all symptomatic of a large segment of society that is desperate   Its not all just greed   This is truly desperation   Desperation from being caught out with too little savings  failing pension systems  work competition from Asia  AI and robots  declining or shifting demographics  that liberal arts degree  the reality re digital nomadism  etc   There have been bubbles and lunacy before  thats nothing new   But this current one is very strong   It comes at a time when the geopolitical and economic tide is shifting after nearly 2 centuries from West to East   People need something to believe because reality is honestly very scary or depressing   People believe in spite of any fact you place before their eyes   The human being is truly amazing   it is capable of so much extremes  whether brilliance or foolishness ,1,2
That s why you buy without leverage and transfer to your hardware wallet after purchase,2,1
I simply have no confidence in cryptos right now  especially the exchanges  And there s Africrypt  too  The whole industry is a risky and speculative mess due to being unregulated ,1,1
Wonderful content   Well personally I feel those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in cryptocurrency world in general or probably just naive and afraid to take risk  Cryptocurrency have seen far more worse times than this  Enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  Few months back  I started trading  though I knew just the basics of trading  I have seen a lot of money being made by people in just few weeks of trading  this was a motivation for me to go into crypto trading full time  I wasn t able to capture the secret to understanding the use of signals so I lost huge amount of money due to inexperience untill I got connected to a trading expert Ms Garcia Redmond on t e l e g r a m   Garciainvestments Under her guide I ve been able to make profits on crypto trading  she s a genius in trading ,1,0

whats with all these Shitcoin traders risking money on exchanges  i ve got all my Bitcoins in my personal wallet and sleep like a baby learned my lesson 10 years ago,1,1
This whole thing is just illigitimate  They do the same thing on Coinbase Pro  They freeze everything when you need to make moves the most,1,1
That s crazy I pulled my doge off last week now my Binance US will not fully open doesn t show any crypto prices keeps saying corrupt data couldn t be read isn t in correct format data corrupted ect so glad I pulled all coins been like this for a while,1,1
Why would anyone buy a leveraged token   I ve read the binance terms on leveraged tokens and everything is laid out  I would never buy it      If you want to be a player  highly not recommended   just borrow some money and leverage yourself that way  Of course I don t have to mention that it s risky  but at least you have an option to do it in a relatively stable environment like BTC  ETH or ADA  yes  those are still relatively stable for crypto standards   And always keep some money on the side so that you can decide whether you want to keep covering your losses or just get liquidated    If you are doing this with established crypto like mentioned  you may be able to go 1 2 or 1 3 fairly safely  but by fairly safely I mean you won t get liquidated immediately but you could spend a good portion of your time with 80  90  losses  NEVER use leverage to buy at all time highs and NEVER use leverage to sell at all time lows ,1,1
Here it comes  BTC                   1000  MSTR                 20   ETH                        50    FEDCOINS around the world introduced  private crypto never recovers    peace,1,1

Recovery has been slow for some coins  worse for some others like X R P   June 16 dip had already flipped support level into resistance and the early morning trade only dropped the coin further below  Tradlng at  0 757  X R P could be seen inching closer towards bedrock  0 697  Awesome Oscillator displayed dominating bearish momentum  The purple indicator of Relative Strength Index  RSI  fell into the oversold zone earlier in the day  A small uptick displayed the indicator rising out of the bearish territory in the coming hours  Parabolic SAR also indicated an active downtrend since the white dotted line appeared above the candlesticks   For now  if X R P trades in positive going forward  it could consolidate above  0 73 and prevent any further downfall  I am currently trading under the guidance of Vincente Sanz and with his accurate signal being implemented in my trade I have made 5 B T C from my initial 2 B T C in just an interval of 5 weeks  Investors should have trade experts guiding them in their trade so as to make more profit and Vincente  is someone I highly recommend and an expert to be mentored by and he has his free courses on google that can help you get started too  He can be reached directly through gma il  vicentesanzofficial gmailcom  and tele gram  vincantesanz  so  trade safe everyone ,1,9
   I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate  digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally  its hard for for anyone going against them these days  though from a trader s perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies   lnvesttors on how the community works  crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come  lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy in the market and whether it isn t too late to buy an asset  when you re hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy  a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price  bulls or bears   I trade using signals from trade expert Mrs  Susan Bossmann with her guide and signal service i  ve made over 27B TC worth of crypto assets over some months  only for crypto inclined issues    connect her on               Susanbossmann ,212,3

I have been a believer in the blockchain and the bitcoin over the years and from experience  I have learned that information about bitcoin comes from three kinds of people  One who knows but would rather suppress the information by publicly criticizing bitcoin but privately stacking up on the asset  there is also the truly ignorant who would swallow any information hook  line and sinker and of course  those that are truly devout to bitcoin and making steady progress in updating with information worth knowing  I have been in the last 2 group but with the assistance of Dwayne  whose trades I have been copying for over 3 months now  netting in more than 9 btc in profit already  Learning never ends and I am still doing so with professional Coach Dwayne Clooney you should reach him on      Tele Gramm  dwayneclooney   Have a Nice day ,1,1

 I must say  Bitcoin s price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks  with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse  the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoin s lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum  One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months  He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead  Tips like this are why it s advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Mr Anthony Robert  He is always one step ahead of other traders  he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money  My earnings have increased drastically from 1 01 BTC to 9 700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy  You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM     anthonyrobert3  ,51,6

im actually scared to stay with binance     iv just been to my wallet and they have REMOVED the prices of my coins from my wallet fiat and spot     i dont even know which coins are down     why would any exchange want to HIDE a coins prices   their trade interface box is also too unnecessarily complex for beginners to understand and its the reason iv never margin traded with binance in case i press the wrong button and i get scammed unlike other exchanges where they make it easy    im going to think about going to bybit but the way i see it at the moment im worried that binance will cause problems if i do this      i just cant trust them anymore its as though they are getting ready to do something and im going to keep my 10k in the bank for now and glad i only have a small acc with binance,1,0

    current  rice action is not abnormal for a bull  arket cycle   and   rices could still resume their recent uptrend before forming a longer term peak  There are definitely still some downside risks short term  and  arkets rarely rebound in one single move up  Thats why at the moment its way more reasonable to stack up more B   by tradling the asset rather than hold waiting for the  arket to skyrocket  I have been a     holder for a very Iong time now but I truly unlocked the full potential of     when sought the council of Peter with my high lnvestments I have been able to make 21    in just a year tradn with his s gnal despite the up and down of the mar ket  believe me  he is way ahead of other tradrs  Peter can easily be reached on t l   a   whatbitcoindid,133,3

Ever since bitcoin cash fell by almost 10  on June 7  and it took a week s time after that for the alt to recover its losses  The token was available at  614 12 on June 16  with the coin recovering by 6  in 2 days  B C H was oscillating between the  570 support and  720 resistance level  The alt had been trading in the red for the past couple of days and even then  it had not crept below the  570 support level  According to the Awesome Oscillator  bearish momentum has been the norm over the past few days  The Bollinger Bands pointed to low price volatility as the bands  while not quite narrow  were parallel  Abrupt price fluctuations are not anticipated for B C H  As soon as the alt started to see a minor price correction  the buying pressure increased between June 14 and 15   The Relative Strength Index signaled that the market almost had even numbers of buyers and sellers  despite the latter gaining the upper hand of late  I am currently trading under the guidance of Vincente Sanz and with his accurate signal being implemented in my trade I have made 7 B T C from my initial 3 B T C in just an interval of 7 weeks  Investors should have trade experts guiding them in their trade so as to make more profit and Vincente  is someone I highly recommend and an expert to be mentored by and he has his free courses on google that can help you get started too  He can be reached directly through gma il  vicentesanzofficial gmailcom  and tele gram  vincentesanz  so  trade safe everyone ,42,11

Great video  Bitcoin has  made investors doubtful  this season  it s now a risk to invest in cryptocurrency but it s still the right time to invest,108,24
As the market is crashing I believe that Hodl is the best option now don t sell out  But the dip and invest  ,1,
bitcoin still has a target of a 100k within 2021,1,
the most common mistake I see new investors make is rushing into cryptocurrency without any guidance,1,
cryptocurrency will definitely take us to the moon   only Bitcoin investors will understand,1,
There are ways to mitigate risks such as using decentralized exchanges like  Pancakeswap  instead of keeping your cryptos and fiat in Binance   Also  even if Bitcoin goes down  there are always new tokens coming out where you can make good money if you know how  Proof that not all cryptos correlate with Bitcoin is if you go to  coinmarketcap  and check the  Gainers and Losers  section  you will see tokens going up up to 1000  even in days that bitcoin is down   One more way to mitigate risks is to use an stable coin such as  BUSD  instead of tether  USDT  and when you want to cash out  you transfer your BUSDs to Binance in batches  example  if you have 10 000 BUSD  you send 1 000 to binance  convert it to fiat and repeat the process until you transfer and convert the whole 10 000 BUSD into fiat  so that if something happens  you do not lose all your money ,1,1

agreed what u describe occurs throughout the financial system  they front run all stocks too and DONT allow exit liquidity  cos the exit side has already been left for the insiders and they TURN OFF electronically everyone else s platform   Every countries regulator is in with the exchanges and why they only deal with INSTITUTIONS complaints AND not the public        AND why 90  of investors lose 90  of their stake IN 90 days   THE PUBLIC MONEY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE INSIDERS TARGET ALLOWED BY GOVERNEMENTS AND EXCHANGES ETC     THE LAW COURTS ARE IN WITH THE GOVS  AN EXCHNGES  THUS U LOSE  ,1,1

When the volatility is extreme  with 4x leverage and it moves  25  it get essential worthless  similar happen to 5x  and 10x Tesla leverage it was up 40000  and then Tesla crashed and it was essential worth nothing  You see  it happen in regulated market as well ,17,3
 David E  Vogel Both  The big problem was the fact that no ones stop losses were working because Binance just turned it off essentially  Most people probably would have been almost liquidated anyway even with stop loss because its at least 4x leverage  The fact that it wasnt working it all   everyone got wrekt ,1,
So is Binance outright thieves or are users making outlandish bets that they cannot cover ,2,
You forgot to tell people that you are a millionaire,1,1
No doubt there was something dodgy going on but also people just don t understand how the leveraged tokens work  When there is a big surge in volatility the price of both UP and DOWN tokens will decrease ,1,1

Since cryptocoins can be traded both inside and outside the digital currency environment  digital currencies are more than just a way to pay for goods and services   they re also a viable investment opportunity   In fact  cryptocurrency has several advantages over fiat funds when it comes to investment opportunities  one of the biggest is that it isn t subject to the same market conditions that traditional currencies are when it comes to foreign exchange rates  The best example of this is the state of the pound after the UK voted to leave the European Union  In the wake of the Brexit vote  the value of GBP began to plummet as investors responded to the realities of the UK leaving the EU and the financial instability this new situation created  However  the world of digital currency is insulated from such real world issues thanks to its very nature   it s not tied to any single bank or government   and as a result  the relative value of most cryptocurrencies did not show a negative impact  In some cases  cryptocoin value actually increased as investors realized that digital currencies like Bitcoin were unaffected by Brexit  Another important advantage of cryptocurrency is its potential for explosive growth  Bitcoin  for example  has demonstrated overall positive growth since its inception   as of August 1st  2017  Bitcoin was trading at more than  2500 per coin  whereas a year ago it was trading at around  600 per coin  Industry experts have long predicted that Bitcoin can and will increase its value even higher in the future  providing excellent potential for long term growth  This is the reason why I choose the service of a professional Mr  Clinton to perfect my trading skills  He handle s my trading and that of my co workers and profit is guaranteed  He can be contacted on T E L E G R A M  clintoncryptotrading or W H A Ts  A P P     44 7417396434  ,29,4

How comes this is the first time I learn about this  ,1,
Sure  but what financially suicidal maniac puts their life savings in a leveraged token  ,8,
but I think the point he s been striking with the more recent videos is that this whole thing started off as a great thing  but has been hijacked  As soon as he talked about Tether I pulled away from altcoins and only have disposable amount in the wallet at any given time ,5,
Auto generated subtitles would come handy,1,1
Dummies if you ask me lol  Great video,1,1
Atleast classical banks have accountability for their actions  The entire thing about crypto was that your money is  yours  to control  nobody else s  Yet we see people begging to Binance and other exchanges for their own money  and they don t even have accountability ,24,10
 Vivek Yadav So you put it in your personal wallet and don t leave it on the exchange  No one can access your wallet except the person with the private key,1,
Most people can t handle their own money  If so  it is better for those people to leave it with banks  than these unregulated companies  For others that feel competent enough  they can do whatever they want ,1,
Yeah I m not stupid enough to do that  The fact that majority of people are comfortable with someone else holding their money for them  is what is bewildering me  Like you re at their mercy  This is exactly what drove them away from banks but they still do the same thing here  I think humans are hard wired to find trust in each other  It s probably overwhelming for most to handle their wallets and all related technical shenanigans  so they just leave it to these companies ,1,

This literally can t happen if you keep your Bitcoin in cold storage  ,33,1
Sell low buy high  dont you mean the other way ,1,1
I got fked by binance during the crash  I had been expecting it to crash and so was shorting it  When I thought it was at the bottom I tried to buy back but the servers told me it was down  By the time they came back on it had said I bought back 10x and as it crashed further I lost 70   Leverage is meant to at most let you lost 50  before it automatically buys back for you  During the crash tho it didn t do that and I was stuck 70  down  I tried to unleverage but they said my leverage score was too low  So I was locked 70  down with no way to buy sell or get out of a 10x leverage ,4,9
I ve been liquidated few times but never heard of this  leverage will close your position when your money is finished  don t get what 50  are you talking about  Now i m not greedy anymore and play very safe  managed to double my money only in altcoins ,2,

so the name of your channel should be replaced from  techlead  to  coinbehind ,1,1

Nice and very informative video i must say    Anyways investing in bitcoin and crypto currency is the best way to make earnings due to the recent outbreak  Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a part cular thing  we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly  One reason you need to in vest in crypto and its tech nology is because  crypto is changing the economy shape of any nation that approaches the tech nology and that way being an early adopter gives you an edge over others that will buy into it late  While looking at the growth rate of cryptocurrency and the opport unity it presents  why not look into it and have a rethink about the particular investment you wish to make now  Get a PRO   like  Mr  Leonard Arthur  whose daily signals and strategy is top notch  With his strategy and daily signals  i was able to grow my portfolio from 2 1btc to 7 3BTC which you can agree is a great profits  MR Arthur can be reached on Telegram  ArthurTrade101  for all crypto related inquiries ,40,18

  Nice content  From a technica  standpoint the biggest cha  enges investors face can range from controing the impulsiveness to the frailty of compu sion  Most newbies   investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical ana ysis to trading  technica  ana ysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regard ess of what is happening in the broad market  In essence  the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict the future movement of the asset  It takes a lot of time to do this  i would say trad ng has been going smoothly for me after accumulating over 17  B T C since late last year with the tradlng strategy given to me by Eva Tony  his strateg es are top notch and profitable you can reach him via  TELEGRAM     Evatony8    cheers    ,49,6

 Guess it s a BUG  Call it a Feature      Bwahahahaha  I am gonna use this ,42,2
i liked that one too lol,2,
bro  you cant know everything  good crypto traders know very well that spot market is the way to go if you like self preservation     take care and dont use leverage,2,1
Been watching you for 2 years  This channel as well as your TechLead Show channel   You re among the most honest  non group think individuals on the internet  In discussion of technology  business  politics   I have major respect for people like you  I hope YouTube doesn t shut you down or penalize you in any way  You re a level man  Thank you for your integrity and your individual courage to speak bluntly about matters  All matters  Thank you ,52,4
Imagine YouTube shutdown TechLead    then he can claim as Ex YouTuber    ,5,
Bruh  you re going to give me a heart attack with these thumbnails ,10,1
Techlead making money by making YouTube videos  I wouldn t listen to any trading  discoveries  techniques he made ,1,2
Yeah I moved my crypto from Binance a few weeks ago ,1,1
Child support to your exchange  ,1,1
  These crypto platforms are scary  All the crypto operations need to be shut down if this is the case  That s not fair ,5,3
Wait  Calm down there  Let me take my money out before shutting down lol ,1,
great video  thank you ,1,1
I have a special power  Every time I get into a stock or crypto it goes down instantly,16,4
Buy the fear and sell the greed aka buy in red and sell in green,2,
Try buying red and selling green instead of buying green and selling red  D,2,
U r not ALONE    ,4,
TechLead is wrong about  crypto YouTubers   For example   Chico Crypto  has been severely critical of Binance and Tether for quite some time ,20,3
 MrSlm1982 Yea he used to be genuinely interested about what he does  Software Engineering  Photography  life philosophy  etc  Now he s just another youtube milking the youtube algo ,3,
He deleted my post about him being wrong about BTC black swan event   He s only making crypto videos because it s trending now    What bothers me is people will take his advice without doing their own research  I like his old content  better ,1,
Lmao  9 51 10 01 haaaaaarsh  D,3,1
Every stable coin had that same identical move  not just tether  You don t know what you are talking about ,1,1
Thank you for this PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT     we really appreciate it  ,7,1
As a crypto HODLer  I agree with you how these centralized exchanges  especially the ones offering 50 100x leverage  are going to be the downfall of crypto  But  I ask to you tech lead    How does that make you feel about exchanges like uniswap  sushiswap  ect  I think this is where a lot of cryto enthusiasm comes from  the idea that eventually  programs on the block chain will verify these things  not some sketchy multi national company like binance  Community bag holders of the protocol s token will decide what kind of trading they want on the platforms  introducing a self regulation of money   I m a bullish bear on crypto  I see the potential to create freedoms and to allow rugpulls,1,1
Jesus i learned my lesson in UWT when the 3x leverage oil ETF hit a liquidation clause without me knowing  Any leveraged based trading vehicle should never be held over night  Be very careful even day trading these  Even these crypto ones with no regulation didn t even do what they were marketed for  So many scams in the crypto space people  it s red hot  So watch out ,1,1
Gosh I love techlead   who else gonna give you such humor while spitting facts  ,16,0
why does he just doesnt leave crypto  ,1,1
Great video  as a millionaire ,2,2

So wait   Coins token aren t volatile enough     People now want to play a leverage game with the coins   Smh   Bad idea   Just buy regular tokens and buy the dip   Bitcoin took years to see massive returns   Why does everyone think things will be overnight   I buy  with the intention to hold for at least 3 to 5 years   That is realistic investment time frames ,1,0
Hex is the only legit crypto  It s a complete product  triple audited ,1,0
Yeah a while back I was messing with the leverage coins  I noticed then they didn t do what they were supposed to do ,2,3
Thieves  Thats what they are ,1,
I always knew those leveraged tokens were scams and didn t follow price action  but this is ridiculous  Thanks for taking a deep dive,21,1
LMAO  Techlead just go with the flow ,2,1
Bought so much EOS yesterday I m going to cry  Talk about EOS next video ,8,0
Having a large stake in the crypto market and listening to your experience all I can say is hahahahahahaha,1,1
This is why DeFi is so important  remove the exchanges all together and use smart Contracts and swaps to balance and exit positions  Only use exchanges for fiat on and off ramps and never hold cryptos there ,6,0
   That s why I only trade Bitcoin through Grayscale fund GBTC or Etherium through Grayscale fund ETCG  just doing large short term trades at the major support   resistance levels      Always safety first         I own a cold storage wallet   have traded cryptos directly in the past  but no more    ,4,1
so this is why cz is super agitated with what elon is doing with his tweets  elon knows what these exchanges are upto,26,3

 Matthew Stevens how s safemoon doing for you then ,2,
 nelsonta00 imo I think people like coinbureau are good hearted  just way to optimistic  bullish and blinded by crypto ego,2,
if you pay ATTENTION he says buy high and sell low yeah keep following him lol lol LOL LOL,4,
 Shafer Hart Crytpo is still in its infancy stage so it requires time to develop and mature  Wall Street has its share of volatility in its early stage as well  and still some here and there now  but they are regulated for stability so I expect the same for Crypto in the future   Elon Musk is a driving force in the Tech industry  so its understandable why ppl listen to him closely  but the economy in Crypto has stabilized since and is now growing again ,3,
 nelsonta00 lol  If a bunch of yt influencers can bring the value of it so easily  let alone Elon fuckin Musk  then clearly something is very wrong about that  next gen  currency ,10,
 nelsonta00 Binance is a sponsor of Coin Bureau    so it is a little difficult they talk bad about Binance  By the way I like Coin Bureau  the channel has no ads and without sponsors there won t be channel at all    so I understand that  Guy  is an sticky situation there ,7,
 nelsonta00 people should be  The whole crypto ecosystem is full of pitfalls ,21,
Sincerely for almost one year now I ve been boycotting your videos   because I m doing less programming   you ve just address what happened to me last month I lost 85  of my savings on binance feature   technically it isn t supposed to be so   thank you for addressing this issue   I hope they won t pay you to keep shut,1,0
Thank you for covering this  I m looking forward to the high quality DEXs coming soon ,9,2
Same  I love dexs,1,
Gotta love how TechLead got the cult horror B movie thumbnail down to a science  Mad props my guy ,31,0
I was a victim of this  I shorted the market  the market crashed  I should ve made tens of thousands of dollars  instead Binance just  took it   simple as that ,84,27
 N Great I have no idea how the manipulation works but the hedge funds profits almost every single day of the year from the markets  I think it was Carnegie that reported they only had 12 days during 2020 they didn t profit  So logically  this doesn t happen without manipulation ,1,
 Dan 123 Have to pay back  Who is going to make them ,1,
 Zonk In my country if an exchange or any corporation steals from you  they have to pay back with interest  it happened before and its gonna happen again ,1,
This is happened to me also  Same story,1,
This is exactly why the US is blocked for Binance  Because those leverage products are as bad as unbacked CFDs which are backed by nothing and are unregulated  It s the wild west for sure  Sucks that people didn t know the risk when they bought these unregulated leveraged tokens  CFDs are not allowed in the US ,2,
 Levy Roth  I don t think you read his comment properly or even watched the video ,6,
That must suck so much  honestly  I know I would be depressed if it happened to me  I m out of crypto now completely  Any market ruled almost completely by Elon Musk tweets is just silly  I simply don t trust these cryptos to go anywhere long term  as they will be replaced by government versions that they can manipulate at will ,11,
Glad  Hope you get broke while we increase our wealth,5,
Volatility drag  your fault for not learning how leveraged tokens work,8,
LOL  I m glad you lost ,3,
 DeathSleep wow I didn t think that those tokens could affect your other assets as well,4,
 ChapmanoTV when he shorts and markets crash    he should be in profits   not his assets getting liquidated      ,25,

 AJBAXTER7677    look just because you re afraid of the market do t mean other will be  Do me a favor and hide  The market is too dangerous for you,4,
Hopefully some of them wake up a little bit  Getting into crypto in this setting is definitely not a great move  Especially when news on crypto flip flops 24 7  How does that yell stable to people ,5,

The thumbnails should be repurposed and sold as NFTs  I d be a buyer  Big fan of the recent Tech Lead Thumbnails ,315,11
Why  What would you do with them  Have you listened to anything he says  Physical items of value require custodianship and curation if they are to be shared with others    Take a screenshot of his thumbnails  or better yet DOWNLOAD them using a free YT Thumbnail grabber tool available on every platform you can think of  Save it to the cloud or store it on a USB drive  Hell  you can even print it and hang it on your wall  The best part is you can t possess it so everyone in the world who will ever exist gets to enjoy it as much as you without any cost to them ,1,
He doesn t need nfts  he already scams by selling courses,2,

Can you do a video on the red flags of tether   As a millionaire ,6,2
He did already,1,
Elon should be more worried about the use of that same  unclean  electricity that people charge his Tesla EVs with   Dirty  Tesla charging  Normal people should NOT trade leverage  even experienced traders get caught out with it and get wrecked sometimes    it s great you re letting people know how bad it is  because it does suck  A lot of people in twitter have had their funds go lost trying to withdraw ,1,1

 TechLead  agreed what u describe occurs throughout the financial system  they front run all stocks too and DONT allow exit liquidity  cos the exit side has already been left for the insiders and they TURN OFF electronically everyone else s platform   Every countries regulator is in with the exchanges and why they only deal with INSTITUTIONS complaints AND not the public        AND why 90  of investors lose 90  of their stake IN 90 days   THE PUBLIC MONEY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE INSIDERS TARGET ALLOWED BY GOVERNEMENTS AND EXCHANGES ETC     THE LAW COURTS ARE IN WITH THE GOVS  AN EXCHNGES  THUS U LOSE  ,1,
