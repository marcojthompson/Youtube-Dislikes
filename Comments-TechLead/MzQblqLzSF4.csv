After the release of new M1 max MacBooks you can t trust this tech lead guy anymore,1,0
Windows 11 sucks  had to go back to windows xp,2,1
Ubuntu wins both ,1,0
I ve never switched to Mac in the first place  as a hundrediere ,2,0
Recently moved back to Windows after about 8 years on Mac  my Mac been great as a student but since graduating I ve realised you pretty much need Windows for work work from home  plus there s far more versatility out there with regards to specs  upgradability etc on the windows side   and honestly just feels nice not to be locked into one specific ecosystem anymore,45,6
  imj3200 shhh    let the Apple enthusiast be  No need to harm them  They will go bankrupt when daddy apple releases a new shiny product  Just watch them from a distance ,1,
true it just seems every where you look there is always this one software which is only available on windows  i wanted to uninstall my windows so bad while dual booting with linux  but bring myself to do that as i need just 1 software which is only supported on windows  so i am stuck with like a 60gb or so installation of winodws just to run some few utilities ,1,
 scally yeah   officially dead with 74  of the desktop marketshare   certainly dead ,11,
 Mohammed Mesum Hussain My favourite OSes ranked  1  macOS 2  Linux 3  Windows  Although Linux is way worse than macOS and windows is a step below Linux ,2,
 scally actually this is true for Linux too  The only reason to use Windows at work in my opinion if you are a DotNET developer or something  looks like MS deliberately makes DotNET development unpleasant on other operating systems  If you don t want to fight with your OS every time you work as a DotNET developer  you better use Windows ,1,
Why tf would you need windows  Mac can install zoom and FaceTime and it has full MS Office  There s no point using windows anymore it s officially dead  Mac is the new king ,7,
Thanks for sharing these experiences  Most videos on YouTube just talk about benchmark and say the M1 is best  Most Probably because they only use Mac stuff and nerver used a real laptop with a dedicated GPU  Or probably don t work on their devices at all   I really have been considering MacBook air M1 even if I m broke but at that price I actually could get a windows laptop that s more capable ,1,0
IN 2021  i am still going to toilet  still eating and still sleep  AND YES  you dont know what i do in 2021  Get your facts together  there are still also other things to do than just content creating all the time without reason  ,1,0
Aaaaand then the M1 Max came out with a 32 core GPU XD,2,0
oct 18th    ok  i switch back to apple   ,1,0
Now that the M1 Pro or M1 Max is out  will you still stay on Windows ,1,0
this video aged badly,2,0
I remember when you were claiming that Windows laptops couldn t go through tabs smoothly  Dell XPS  Overall really low information reviewing    mostly emotions based and throwing some keywords in there,2,1
IDK why but this video gave me so much clarity thank you and now I am confident in my Switch back to Windows ,1,0

Soo   Are your opinions still valid about CPU GPU after latest Apple Keynote ,1,0
Thanks for the insights  I ll be switching from Win to Mac    edit  So I did  about two months ago  Not looking back ,2,0
As a millionaire   I refuse to even watch your crap ,1,0
LOVE to hear what you think about the latest releases of MacBook Pro s as of today with the upgrades in GPU cores and the Max Chip as well  I wonder if they heard you and stepped up their game at Apple  Will you try out one of the new MacBooks and see if they have the guts to keep up ,11,0
This guy is gonna switch back to Mac after today  Mark my words he will drop a new video when he gets the M1X on Monterey   ,3,0
bRUh they copied Ubuntu,1,1
But  but  Linux does it better   ,1,0
 Evil is back and we have to take it down  Apple get with the program   LOL  Best line ever  Made my drink come out of my nose   I always watch this video whenever apple releases a new MacBook Pro  LOL,7,0
Gaming and create content is not everything  You can go to an university and be a professional  Period ,1,0
Ye  maybe if Apple can use RDNA2   M1 they can come back and be competitive  But I think they re going all in on GPU on an SoC  which worries me they ll be trailing behind in GPU indefinitely ,1,0

 If you cannot play Diablo 2  then I dont know what you are doing with your life  you might as well just die right now  The undeniable truth,3,0
The reactions of the outraged cult members are always entertaining ,4,0
The thing is with me   I have been nurtured on Microsoft and when I went to the iPad  I thought that it would be faster and it is   The problem is that everything I am doing on an  Apple is so out of kilter   In other words  it seems that you have learned a new system  and believe me  it is not easy   I tried for two years to go with Apple   True  their service features are great   The thing is that Apple  although a good machine  I found it hard to learn different things on it   Maybe  it is because I grew up with the original IBM desktop   Now Microsoft comes out with a new win 11 which I don t like the flower logo on the desktop   If they just stayed with the original windows logo  that would have been fine ,3,2
Straight to the point  I likey,1,0
do you think it will also be a serious competition to the Android tablet market now that windows laptops or tablets can work as Android tablets ,1,0
I am switching back to Windows as well  I ve been a software engineer for over 10 years and started on Windows  migrated to Mac due to UNIX  and other reasons for software development related to iOS and Mac   and I am now switching back to Windows  save a M1 Mac Mini for testing my iOS and Mac apps     For the majority of tasks I can do everything I need on a Windows system and go on the mini for occasional testing  You can use Docker  much better than VirtualBox from back in the day   setup servers or remote instances as needed  etc    I ve had nothing but regrets from my last MacBook Pro that was over 3K  not to mention the horrendous gaming capabilities since my first use in 2012  as I tend to have a lot running simultaneously  why shouldn t I be able to at the rates they charge   A 3k  Windows would be like Usain Bolt compared to WoW guy from South Park taking a stroll from his chair to the bathroom   Not to mention the horrible job they have done with the flex port  internal cooling  and nerfing their own hardware  I know there are other methods for testing and of course you can set up a virtual environment  get xcode up and running for testing with the simulator  might have issues with sound depending on setup   but it makes sense to keep around the mini for testing and teaching a course for game development  Other than that Apple has dropped the ball for far too long ,4,0
I loved this video and yes  Evil is back and that is the reason I just built a PC   I ve used Macs since the late 80 s but the price vs  hardware is just gotten way out of hand   Thanks again for the video   ,3,2
I didn t even know they were releasing a remastered version of d2  Nostalgic ,1,1
UI is easily copyable  Mac hardware is phenomenal  My 8GB RAM Mac works FASTER than a 32GB Lenovo Windows  and both cost almost the same ,1,1
It only took them like 20 years to redesign the UI  Good job windows  I still will stick with Linux but windows at least will be less awful for me to have to use when I need to do it for work     in 5 10 years  when all my clients finally get off of deprecated or almost deprecated versions   ,6,0
Started rewatching these videos because a lot of jokes are hidden,1,0
I switched back and love it  never going Mac again,12,9
 Tyesov yeah and the notch issue with newest models  M1 pro  M1 max   that s recently going on now is bothering me more and more I m sure they ll fix it but they will take it off in the newer models within the next year or so like they just added most of the ports back   for 2k      Ehh to each his own I guess,1,
 Shawn I think about it as well  Mbp 16 base with 16 gb and 1 tb  Its look like the only way to go now ,1,
 Tyesov yeah I agree they don t last ,1,
 Shawn I don t know  man  Especially in terms of build quality  all windows laptops are crap  I am also in two minds and can t find a decent alternative ,1,
what you switch back to  looking for lappy suggestions    budget 1 3k  obviously prefer a lower price    music creation  gaming and game development usage ,1,
Thanks for the honest MAC assessment  I ve used an IMac since 2009 and it s gone down hill in performance ever since Jobs passed over  I thought it was just my IMac and the 8GB of Ram  but it looks like the crashes and GPU sticking with a few apps opened also seems to happen with the premium hardware  So sad because they used to be great ,9,8
 Sim Salabim macOS is superior in every way  no one in their right mind should use windows  You probably just couldn t afford a new Mac ,1,
 Alex S  They do  Macs build quility is shite  You can watch Louis Rossmann channel  where they take them apart and tell you how bad they are  I owned many and I repaired them  including baking the mainboard of a macbook pro where the nvidia chip wasn t soldered correctly   the build quality inside is pure crap  terrible cooling  terrible parts  The only thing macs have going for them is a very good OS  which has nothing to do with today s company  it s a UNIX based system and all credit goes to those who created UNIX    Instead of a say iMac  you can buy a 60 inch TV and a PC with quality parts and you still are going to be paying less  I have a hard time telling my brother off from buying another iMac    Apple fans are like brainwashed ,2,
 Sim Salabim That s true  If only Windows laptop manufacturers could compete with Apple in terms of quality and reliability  They ve also built a solid ecosystem ,3,
the reason macs became popular is because WinXP was getting old and Vista was a nightmare  I had bluescreens  lags during presentations in front of many people  not to mention all kinds of troubles during working on projects which weren t present in XP   so back then I switched to Mac    When  however  Windows 7 became quite stable and you read a lot of good stuff about it  in 2013 I switched back and never looked back  There s no reason to own a mac since Windows 7  Half the price and the experience is nearly identical ,2,
What about new M1 macs  Haven t you heard of them  They outperform any Intel laptop,1,
 If you cannot playing Diablo 2  then I don t know what you re doing with your life  you might as well just die right now because evil is back and we have to take it down  Apple  get with the program    Some of these lines are just gold ,6,0
I like this channel as a Nonmillionaire ,1,0
Most bipolar youtuber ever,1,0
In my opinion you are right  especially since the release of the framework laptop  which is literally the opposite of the mac  You can just upgrade it  repair it easily  etc  It s something that is probably never going to happen with Apple,1,1
when I look back at my life as a millionaire  I have no regrets ,1,0
Where s my unix gang at,1,1
I m literally down to taking computers year by year  In 2021  the entry level M1 Macs aren t to my liking  They are amazing processors  in Apple s low end hardware  so it s an odd match  I don t want or need a 13  basic laptop with huge bezels from 2011 or a Mini  or a pastel 24  iMac with 2011 s chin  So I stick with PC  despite high potential for the M1  Flash forward this time next year  I may be rocking a 16  M X  Macbook with some game changing graphics  or a beefed up M X  Mini  external GPU and dual 5k monitors  who knows  Or Maybe Qualcom or AMD come out with ARM based CPUs that rule everything else    dunno yet  I won t swear off any platform  just wait and see which will best suit on an annual basis  Comps aren t that expensive  compared to earning a good living using them  so may as well own the best for any given year  IMO ,1,0

So that s what I want Windows 11  because it s new and shiny    actually I ve been running the developer preview of it and it has quite a few small random bugs and made some videos on it ,1,1
I literally just switched to a mac a year ago after watching your video on why macs are better ,3,1
only reason you would need windows is video games  or microsoft pays you to make a youtube video about windows 11 ,1,1

Since Microsoft has decided that personal computers are no longer personal  and they seem to think it s ok to stop users from controlling things like updates  I ve gone back to Ubuntu   update  I have gone with Manjaro instead  ,45,18

 Harish Kumar Its desktop pc and I will keep that in mind,1,
I decided to go back to windows xp  ,1,
  Harish Kumar I tried linux mint with dual boot and it was just bad  Even audio didn t work and yes I tried to fix it and googled fixes but nothing worked  I just removed it and went back to windows 10  Although I almost couldnt boot because of the dualboot but luckily that could be fixed from the BIOS ,2,
Here rocking Arch with KVM virtual machines for every other OS  A heavily tweaked and customized Windows 10 AME  Android x86  even a Hackintoshed Big Sur    Pretty much every other OS lost its baremetal privileges and its candidacy for daily driver ever since I learned about VFIO ,1,

2021 you need both  PC for hardcore gaming and Mac for working,1,4
MacOS doesn t have bloatware  That depends on what you call bloatware  I have iCloud constantly asking me to pay up to get more storage  I don t use iCloud  nor will I ever  Then there is Pages and other office suite type garbage I will never use  Macs are full of bloatware ,1,0
This will result in a massive waste disposal of millions of computers that wont run Windows 11 due to the strange new requirements in hardware  That should be addressed by all of us and Microsoft should not pollute the planet with moves like this ,6,1
Those computers can still run Linux distro s no problem  Hopefully folks who have computers that can t use windows 11  will sell their computers   That way folks who have less money can just buy those computers and install pop os  or elementary os  or Manjaro on them ,2,
Well  what about plugging in an external gpu when   if needed  You have the thunderbolt 4 after all  why not use it   Not an apple fanboy  arch user  ,3,3

More like a Mac  It looks way better than macOS TBH  Windows 11 comes with a lot of BS apps  Like macOS doesn t do the same  huh  Windows has always been better except for the UI UX and security  A part from that  what else was macOS better for  Nothing  Personally  I have never had any security issue with Windows since Windows 95 and 98  and the UI UX difference between macOS and Windows was never worth the price  between 3 and 4 times more for a Mac with the same or similar specs   However  after the Epic Games vs Apple lawsuit  we now know that Apple had really bad security issues in the past as well  which they hide from the public for years   and the Windows 11 UI is now better than the one on macOS  On the telemetry department  you always can use 3rd party software to block all useless Windows services  What s the Mac fanboys  excuse now ,1,1

What is the white arm stand in left of view early in video  Lamp or mic   I use both often side by side but I enjoy the daily use of Mac experience and most of my media creative  photo video   It s just reliable  but  I do have those PC needs  more so Windows encoding apps I use  My older PC s of matched Mac Pro specs  dual Xeon media workstations  can be pushed further updated w  many options ,1,1
People actually still watch this guy of how he treated his family    Bruh he s been exposed so many times,1,2
Please I need someone to help me trade or invest the forex or crypto market because I m tired of trading in losses myself  I ve blown my account twice and it s frustrating ,10,32
 Evil is back and we have to take it down  Apple get with the program    Lol  This was great ,267,28
 100Bucks it s really   Apple  have it OUR way  until we drop support next year  ,1,
 Fresh Hotline Yeah  honestly I think it comes down to how they are doing the revamp   From what I ve heard it still uses much of the code from the original engine and unfortunately that particular engine needs a major overhaul to work properly on 64 bit systems   While it may happen someday  macOS Catalina on up no longer supports 32 bit apps anymore   So assuming that s true it seems like the main reason it s a PC exclusive is simply because windows offers better backwards compatibility and Blizzard is simply looking to revamp their existing game and not build it over again from the ground up ,1,
 Zombie Survivor LOL  I like how you re attempting to turn this conversation from a simple comment about it being sad that Blizzard made the decision to drop support for Apple products  to an attack on Apple  to now questioning me personally   Believe what you want  but I ve been programming for almost 20 years and know a thing or two about code and computers   But once again I don t get why you re bringing half this stuff up   What does an infinite loop program have to do with this conversation in the slightest   I 100  guarantee you that my Mac CPU can outperform the chip in the Nintendo Switch and it has better thermals than it too   So attempting to take a weird edge case scenario that really has nothing to do with anything and say see   This is why you can t do it  when clearly this all works on much much much weaker hardware is just laughable     But go ahead  keep googling for reasons to hate Macs   Maybe you can contact IBM and tell them what you discovered and that even though they think that they save hundreds of dollars per user that switches from PC to Mac they are actually wrong and despite the hundreds of thousands of Apple products they ve deployed internally all their studies about efficiency are actually wrong because no one at IBM programs or something  or they d know that running infinite loops heats up a CPU     LOL  Meanwhile in the real world  many of us have discovered we can work harder and more productive on a Mac than on windows   Doesn t apply to everyone  but for me personally I ve save countless hours of time and a LOT of money since switching my entire business from PC to Mac as well     But hey   You do you   And if that means trying to convince random strangers on the internet that everything they experience first hand is wrong because of a few edge cases you found on Google be my guest  but something tells me you won t be changing my mind any time soon   ,1,
 Zombie Survivor Well actually you didn t say anything about  Native  support     But since Metal came out 2 years before Vulkan and was a huge step up from OpenGL one could argue that in 2014 Apple really was trying to do right by game developers   Fast forward half a decade and even MoltenVK outperforms OpenGL  not to mention that Metal is significantly easier to use than Vulkan making it easier and faster to deploy      So why isn t Metal the  winner    Because Vulkan is cross platform   But even that s not exactly true     These days most game studios use 3rd party tools like Unity and Unreal Engine and they handle all the heavy lifting when it comes to graphics APIs and write code to both Vulkan and Metal as needed so that most developers don t even have to work with it on any deep level   And I couldn t stop laughing at your whole running  infinite loop with 30 threads   simple aritmethics on Macbook M1    I have no idea what you re even trying to convey here since the context of this conversation is that Blizzard is willing to port their games to the Nintendo Switch but not the M1 Macs   And spoiler alert     the ARM processor in the Mac is more capable than the ARM processor in the Nintendo Switch    I m starting to think that you just have an axe to grind with Apple and are expanding the topic as far as you can to try and find fault with them   But it s really getting off point   And the point is     For a company that develops their own in house engines and employees entire teams of people familiar with Metal and M1 development that they have made the decision to not put them to work on their newer tools is kind of sad ,1,
 Zombie Survivor And yet     World of WarCraft  WarCraft III Reforged  Diablo III  Heroes of the Storm  Hearthstone  StarCraft Remastered are all running just fine on Apple ARM  thanks to Rosetta  and in most cases were ready to play very quickly as Apple is doing the heavy lifting to let people run Intel based apps on the M1 Macs without requiring any updates  in most cases      So with the vast majority of their games running on M1 Macs without issues it s odd to say that Blizzard can t continue doing this because Apple is preventing them from doing what they are already doing ,1,
 Drenathor Also Apple deliberately doesn t support the widely adopted Vulcan  industry standard   also ditch OpenGL  But they instead use their own Apple Metal graphics API which nobody use ,1,
 Drenathor Well it s not Blizzard fault  but it s Apple fault for ditching Intel   Porting Blizzard games to ARM  Apple M1  will need millions of dollars ,1,
Yeah as someone who s on the Mac side of things  Blizzard s decision to pull more and more games off of Mac is rather saddening   Especially when they make all sorts of noise about Apple products not being capable of running their new tech and then repeatedly porting it to a Nintendo Switch     Thanks for the double slap in the face Blizz     Why not just tell us you just don t make your money back porting to Mac or something believable ,2,
Apple  Give me your money for no reason ,3,

Honestly I bought a MacBook solely for entertainment purposes such as web browsing  streaming TV  music  photo library  I also use iPhone   and some work stuff  I prefer it to Windows laptops not really because of the OS but because of the build quality  So many of my Windows machines would feel crappy and have a loose hinge or a blown speaker  My MBA is sleek  sturdy  quiet  great speakers  great screen  I use my gaming PC for more serious work and gaming  obv   but MacBooks are quite a luxurious little entertainment machine ,1,1

Obviously you re a millionaire  as you constantly keep reminding us  and have the time to play Diablo 2 or what ever games you play but for me  a serious web designer systems administrator  the MacOS and Linux work way better with much better stability and performance than Windows without all the bloat of Xbox games  Microsoft Teams and other garbage I d personally never use  And let s be real here  Windows 11 is just nice eye candy smoke and mirrors over what is essentially Windows 10 as the underlying code base  It s still not as stable or secure and tries to be the operating system jack of all trades but the master of none  You still have to deal with all the invasive data collection and lack of privacy crap  the constant Windows updates that take forever and a day to complete as well as the headache of the dreaded blue screen of death should something not play nice  Not to mention adding Android s poor app security which opens up your system to a whole other world of exploits and malware  So yeah  you go right ahead and go home to Microsoft  I ll stay where I m at and be an extremely happy Mac Linux camper  Ta ta ,1,0

It depends on your personal   work needs  I ve been a Windows user my whole life for gaming purposes but as a Software Engineer student I cannot stress enough how much the M1 Mac trumps over Windows in day to day work and various task managements   Windows is a home for gaming and graphic s cards that you are right about  no competition what so ever  In spite of that  it still uses some pretty outdated methods and not really is that User Friendly  Take for instance the fact that the whole  responsiveness  concept Windows has going is just a  Hide the problem with a blanket  solution    Everything will OPEN instantly but will LOAD in real time and might even stay not responsive for a few seconds  whereas with the MAC you might get that fraction of a second of delay before a program will open but when it does it is fully functional and fluent until the moment you close it  This is a big difference when WORKING on a machine daily and not just opening a single Game application and playing it and calling your experience  amazing  ,1,0

 MINDRIGHT garbage is a bit too much  sure windows has its share of problems but it also has its good points  ease to use  better support  wider choice of software and aesthetically stunning out of the box  most important thing is that its moving forward be in a good way or bad way  not sure how well will it be but i heard that win 11 will have native supports for android app so its a good things though we wont know if it perform any better than anbox or not but its sure look promising  everyone love shiny things but not everyone love to tweak things  not everyone is a tech expert so having better support is beneficial to these people  for example  how will you expect somebody like an old man or a kid who has little knowledge about pc to configure cups so that he can use some scanner machine  sorry for this jumble mess but i just want to tell u its might not be as bad as what u call a garbage  it might not be for you but for other especially gamers  normies its the better choice ,1,

Damn  he hit the nail on the head with my situation lol  I m someone that has a MacBook which I thought would be able to at least handle league of legends and to make a long story short  it can t lol  I didn t buy the MacBook for gaming but logically I thought something that cost over a thousand dollars could play a basic game like league of legends  No joke  after a 30 minute game of league  the computer needs to be charged again  On top of that the heat it immites while gaming could legit burn someone  So happy to be switching to a PC that can actually play games AND MORE  I m coming home windows    lol,3,1

at 50 times the price of PC at the same performace   just kidding,1,
 Trevor but m series will never be powerful as dedicated GPU,2,
It is unfortunate that M2 or M1X  GPU benchmark is only double of M1 chip    making it still not decent enough comparing to other GPUs   take for example  I can play starcraft II in 2k with relatively high detailed level on my 2015 imac 5k  but it can barely run in 2k in my M1 macbook       even benchmark doubled  the GPU performance is still well below the 3080 etc ,3,

Hey Microsoft  what ever happened to Windows 10 being the  last ever Windows Operating system   Didn t buy it when I heard that 6 years ago ,37,12
  Jernyx You would have answers to your simplistic questions if you have read through the comments above  But I will reiterate because people are under the assumption that I care more so that I am laughing at Microsoft  and people who I know IRL and online who believed then  The trouble and confusion you cause when you don t leave a   lol  or a laughing emoji at the end     Microsoft themselves stated that it will be their last OS and continue to work on the OS  the context of course being that they abandoned two failed versions before Windows 10  They planned to unify their windows phone  which failed too   tablet  that nobody cares about  and PC OS into one big eco system  this lead to the disastrous known as the tile based UI  that every one absolutely loved  sarcasm  eventually that spawned into the first version of Windows 10  first update that still had the tile based UI  And everyone just stuck to Windows 7 because it wasn t a complete pile of crap  by the time they removed it and got a useable version of Window 10 build number god knows what  They told press that they will just be providing updates to improve on the mess they undid with Windows 8 and 8 1    I use Windows 10 personally and professionally  most of the software I use aren t ported to Linux and gaming is still fairly Windows centric  but all that can change if Microsoft regresses from here and or developers start cross platform developing with Linux ,2,
 Rodrigo Salles  Windows 11 is also 64 bit only  They have finally ditched 32 bit which is probably why they did the whole version naming thing  I don t care that it s 10  11  or whatever  I care that it stable  works well in a corporate environment  keeps supporting and working with open related products and standards and runs the software I need to run    Windows on the desktop does all of the above the best for me  while Linux didn t   I couldn t get my threadripper system with 10gb Ethernet card running properly but when I switched back to Windows it worked first install,1,
 Rodrigo Salles Next PC build AMD with Linux dont have to worry about drivers as NVIDIA not involved  Next build 2025 anyway  My PC CPU will be 17 then  So Linux will be my main OS by then I think ,1,
 Rodrigo Salles Exactly  Microsoft never had any intention of giving away this build  which is 150  more stable than the utter trash they gave out for free  They still wanted to tact on their tile menu that failed with Windows 8  Everyone hated it so they eventually gotten rid of it  Linux has been getting mindshare in the OS market for years because of Microsoft dropping the ball  so much that they even cut the price down so much and sold digital copies of Windows 10 for next to nothing in the end  Their excuse   To combat privacy and especially in regions out of their jurisdiction      I can t say that I ve had too much problems with Windows 10 outside the usual complaints  but I remember distinctly telling a class mate in college who uttered the last OS statement back in 2015  I told him wait for a Windows 11  Microsoft has to be greediest company on the planet  and they have more money than god  They re goal is to get everyone on subscription plans for all of their products and services  not just Xbox pass which I will never support  I foresee the future where most people will go Open Source with OS  I have my copy of Ubuntu Budgie that is only relegated for use as a Live CD to recover files if my system goes pear shaped  But I can see myself slowly transitioning to it  when most devs port their applications to Linux ,1,
 Legion Z yeah like the integrated spyware  bloatware and telemetry  just so I can see some rounded shadows  Cant wait,2,
 pmotion So was Win10 to previous OS owners  I find it a little amusing that people believed the bs when they explicitly said that it will be the last version and they ll just keep improving on it  We will see what kind of  big update  it will be  my only hope is that it isn t buggy and force updates you at awkward times    Only reason why I haven t switched to linux yet is due the most of the software I use aren t cross platform  I can use Wine but my Windows hasn t been so poor that it would drive me to set that up ,9,
Windows 11 is free to windows 10 owners    so I am not exactly seeing the issue  It basically is just a big update,9,

 Urushika cheers  I said 2 years and a gaming PC assuming you actually use it as a gaming PC   don t  care about casual games I m talking AAA stuff that my PS4 can still handle and its not even a PRO   ,1,
As ex facebook ex google ex apple former stripper,2,
 Michal Spirko you can do the same with a pc  mine is from 2008 and still manage casual gaming and everything else you would like to do and it did cost 1000  custom build  Not saying that macs are bad  but seen this type of comments about ppl thinking that pc only last 6 months    Cheers,1,
 Michal Spirko I like MacOS  but PCs actually last just as long with even better software support for the long run  My uncle still uses an ancient Core 2 Duo laptop running smoothly on Windows 10  Can you run Big Sur on a Core 2 Duo Mac  I guess you can unofficially but that requires some sort of voodoo patching  Windows 10  on the other hand can officially run on 15 year old PC hardware ,1,
 Prog  Z horrible to program on it  compared to what  Windows  This is like one of the main reasons developers use Mac because of its Unix like workflow combined to OS stability and performance ,3,

 Michal Spirko my 3 years old Alienware 17 R5 with GTX 1070 is still running all the recent AAA games without any problems  But I cant stop you from bullshitting  ,3,
 Michal Spirko  lol   you arent even able to think properly  If you just want a functional PC so what the point of your comparison  Most people buy a PC gaming to play games  And there are many games and mod arent available on console  And if you buy a PC gaming only to do daily tasks  why do you say it only last 2 years  I call it BS ,1,
 Khanh Nguyen my proposition was a combination of a functional PC  Mac    a gaming platform  a console of your own choosing    but in order to be able to  understand that you would have to be able to read    uhhh shots fired  D,1,
 Michal Spirko you are comparing a gaming PC to a Mac Mini    what kind of games can you play on Mac Mini  Apple Arcade ,3,
 Michal Spirko Do you fact check anything you say or do you just love spewing nonsense online ,1,
Why I sold all my windows PCs   ,2,
 Michal Spirko Thats not true  You can find laptops PCs from 2004  2018 in working condition  I know ppl using MSI laptops for years no problem  The thing is that what you can do  like playing heavy games on PC  that can be tasking but you can not do anything like that on Macbooks even if you want  of course they going to last  I had a Mackbook and was a waste ,4,
 As an ex google ex Facebook ex husband techlead ,2,
but yes  a gaming laptop is probably best for a travelling millionaire who likes to game  ex Google ex Facebook millionaire I should say  D,2,
 Michal Spirko I don t know mac products so much  but I think it depends of the usage you do It seems horrible to program on it  and some softwares just aren t available to mac,2,
 Michal Spirko 2 years old life time  that s not true people just want to buy the latest gpu and flex it  you don t need a high end gpu to play video games  and a console has the same problems  the ps4 is very insufficieny compared to the ps4 pro  and even with that the performance is still lower that the one on a pc  which  if you don t care about high end 8k performance will have a bigger lifespan than a console,9,
 Michal Spirko switched back to PC three years ago after an eight year affair with Mac and would never look back  I also parked my iPhone on the shelf and got myself a non iPhone four months ago   what a relief ,12,
