 I appreciate you and your content  Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly confounding that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T A  and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC pumps pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems  It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC but recently seeing nice upside move  We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps  narrowly avoiding a long term bear market  More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  I ve been day trading crypto for 2 months with Thomas Andrew daily signals and insights and was able to make 17 BTC as profit from my initial 6 8 BTC  ,325,9

Great  video and some nice tips  This is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions  This could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount  Wealth is created during bear markets  not bull markets  If your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk  Let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon  I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 16  btc from day trading with Gerard McDonald in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,45,10

I feel you  I m down nearly 50  this year    Losses started in Dec   Should have pulled out  but then I didn t foresee a fucking war in Ukraine on top of everything else   It was the buying and holding that caused this loss though  if I d have kept on Day Trading  I would be doing great like I did All of last year ,7,3

Wow  the dollars getting stronger,1,2
What don t you understand  The inflation is very high  the unemployment is very low  so the FED needs to raise interest rates and cool off the economy and cool off inflation  They have been saying that they are shooting for a rapid increase in rates  so this is a problem especially for growth stocks which have valuations for earnings far into the future  As the cost of waiting for the earnings gets increased considerably by the FED  tech valuations get adjusted downward  Also  higher interest rates mean higher returns to keep your money in dollars as compared to other currencies ,2,2
Read Tim Price s book Investing Through the Looking Glass  It s a pretty thin book and full of good insights from an investor in London who has been doing it for many years  I learned a lot by reading that book ,1,2
The Feds pretty much F ed everyone with printing out so much money that there is uncontrolled inflation  The can only bring down inflation with raising interest rates  puts downward pressure on everything   Almost every country out there received loans from the USA and have to pay them back in USD  as they buy up USD there is not enough to go around ,2,2

JPow doesn t want a strong dollar   that s bad for the US economy  In any case    the reason the markets are crashing is simple    RISING INTEREST RATES    Don t fight thr Fed   If you don t fight thr Fed when they lower interest rates to 0  and print money  then don t fight then when they take the punch bowl away and raise rates   That simple   This happened in 2018 and they crashed the markets 20  before reversing course   Will they reverse course this time   If so asset prices will sky rocket and the dollar will tank ,1,1

Most people get it wrong trying to profit off of every move the market makes  Chasing gains is like chasing losses for gamblers  Buy good companies at a good price and watch paint dry is the best advice I can give  Paper gains and losses are normal throughout the investing cycle,4,
At best I will sell out of stocks that no longer meet my standards  buy other stocks   if i sell i have to put it in the bank which gives me a terrible interest rate  I am getting 15 to 20 percent every year on several  stable dividend stock   It makes zero sense  Cash isn t king at all in this era  Long term investors know that the market and economy will recover eventually  and investors should be positioned for such a rebound,1,
From value investment perspective  as long as you own financially stable business with earnings   this can be an opportunity to buy more and selling off everything makes no sense  but short term investors and speculators can sell off if they have made profit on their initial investment and still benefit from volatility of the market  I think now is the best time to buy financially stable dividend stocks  I keep buying my targeted stocks on low days,6,

Remember that June was around the time the Fed said they were beginning to think about thinking about raising rates  Since then  the USD has been rising,2,1
DXY is rising cause the 2y 10y 30y treasury rates are rising fast  You got country like Japan that just refuse to raise their rate deal to their massive debt  250  over GDP   China is even forced to lower their rate deal to their housing market crash and new covid lock down  Their currencies tank so hard  You said it yourselves  In order to counter inflation  Fed raises rate so money is worth something now ,2,3

the easiest most reliable strategy at least in regards to crypto is to just periodically buy during a dip based on what you can reasonably afford whether it s a grand or a couple hundred dollars  whether or not you want to hold is up to you but at least you know all your coin you bought is at the low end  the biggest temptation that s hard to avoid is when Bitcoin is making a huge climb and you buy more in the middle of it s climb or right before the end of it,3,2

Hey Tech Lead  do you invest in physical gold and silver  Nowadays investment portfolios should be hedging a part in precious metals  they are lime the safest place to store long term savings ,2,2

The reason DXY is ripping is simple  the basket of currencies the dollar is valued against is even more crap and devalued as the dollar  ECB for example is still doing QE off negative interest rates and here we are  It s not so much that the dollar is somehow a rock solid investment  it s just that its major counterparts are doing even more poorly ,31,4
I was following YouTubers till I realized they caused a lot of coin pumps so I chipmunked a few Pennies everywhere and sold each time a youtuber mentioned them   I m at least a penny o  naire   never invest what ur not willing to lose  best advice ever ,3,2

Quant statistical trading works but it should be unique and thoroughly backtested   Especially with efficient data processing tools available today  it is possible to be profitable even for retail traders  Speculative trading also works but unfortunately the rate of success is extremely low  But I do know few people who have been making million dollar plus each year for more than 10 years now  I wouldn t call them gifted but sure they are outliers ,1,1
The only good video you ve done on investment  A sincere one  just buy the index  never sell,1,2

I sold everything nearly at the top  in December  As I said  Meet Kevin went back in too early  but he was pressured by his audience to buy back in  Many politicians are betting on a way lower low by July  I read the documents and I knew it was time to get out  Still 100  cash and will wait for more slow bleed,4,2

Yeah   gotta love the honesty about the markets   I don t know   some days its all bad   But here  are my stock picks   Pet food and Coffee beans   As more crypto stock picking YouTube channels collapse with the market  we lll see a HUGE uptick in edu tainmment  lifestyle Youtube videos instead     More cat videos  husky dogs who howl  deers that get stuck in farmer fences  prank videos and people showing you what coffee makers and roasted beans are  best  Sure   divorce YouTube videos will also see a sharp uptick as the financial stress of collapsing NFTs and meme coins  destroy more family lives   How to make   How to  videos will always be a Blue Chip investment for the HODL ers out there in 2022 23  PS  the above investment  advice was not intended as investment advice,2,
