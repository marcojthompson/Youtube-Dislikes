Great content as usual  Man I look forward to every single video you make  Thank you for helping all of us stay on top of the market  A lot has changed and that s on everything but the truth is I don t even care much about bullish or bearish market anymore because Ray F Johnson got me cover as I am comfortably making 3 1BT C monthly ,5,6

Please no more Californians   they ve already made things so much more expensive here than it used to be  especially in reno and have made Nevada such an ugly place to live now that they ve trashed it and made it so expensive,1,1
I lived in Las Vegas from 2009 2021   In that time frame  I regressed physically  mentally  and spiritually   First  you re right   Its not normal to live in a city with no humidity   you will have dry eyes and dry skin   Second  there is no culture or charm in Vegas   Third  EVERY house looks the same   Fourth  there are no gorgeous trees or vibrant green grass   Many people have fake grass or rock in their front or back yards   Fifth  the people are not the friendliest  Vegas is a blast to visit    not to live   I can see where Vegas would be an upgrade from Los Angeles because there is hardly any traffic in Vegas and the cost of living is much lower    I personally moved to Dallas 3 months ago and am sooo happy   Sad that I stayed in Vegas for sooo long ,2,1
As a person who s visited Vegas over 20 times just the last several years  this is shocking  I m also a Software Engineer who s considering moving to Vegas  Thank you for doing all the research and sharing this with us  You re the best  TechLead ,10,2

120F heat for months on end gets boring  Also traffic is horrible if you have to commute from one part of the city to another  Horrible place to raise a family with high crime and worst school system in the nation  Also  high transient population of losers from other states that get the bright idea to  give vegas a try  after failing miserably in their own states  Texas  FL  Alaska  WA much better choices  If you are a Crypto millionaire then I recommend Puerto Rico ,1,0
I am in a different country but have just gone through a similar thing    Moved for a job with more money   cheaper housing  less traffic  Nice beaches   There s no1 to date as generally less educated  don t take care of themselves  rude lazy disgusting  as in sexually creepy    The water tastes weird and has also ruined my hair n skin   Drivers are less but the worst I ve ever seen   Flights home cost a fortune now  or an 9 hour drive   So yeah  it s important to build a healthy happy life for yourself and the grass isn t always greener  I am pretty depressed with my situation  I don t work remotely   I m going to try another city and if that fails I ll go home ,1,0

 Traders should avoid attempting to predict trend reversals  or even worse  the moon is ours the price is amazing for every early investors for those who got in for the first time otherwise it s just bouncing back to normal price for the rest of us which is good  Those who hold the longest will profit the most  I trade and hold profits keep up the great work  and also Expert Edward Samuel Michelson has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 8 btc lately ,47,5
I m an ex pat from LA living in Tokyo and your point about water is so so true  Japan has a very humid climate and their tap water is a super clean quality I definitely noticed the difference in my skin condition as soon as I moved out here  BTW  regarding DeFi  can I get involved even though my money is in Japanese Yen ,1,1

Crime is also starting to become a problem in Las Vegas  It has growing pains  Lots of people moving in  Price hikes for homes and rent  but stagnant pay  So more people in hoods equals a rise in crime  Traffic kind of sucks now  Humidity has never been an issue  I actually have a hard time breathing in places like the south or the bay  Sacramento because it s too humid  I guess I m used to the desert,1,1
Anything is worth getting out of California  you need to take into consideration of all the people around you  I would think it would be difficult to meet someone in California that isnt a crazy liberal   If I were in your shoes I would either go to Puerto Rico  or Scottsdale   Scottsdale doesnt have the tourist people constantly coming and going and definitely a nice area to live with plently of beautiful women that love money lol ,1,1

I would certainly not go to Vegas to live and work  I d go there for some days to have fun and that s  it   I d live in an apartment in a nice building where people of my financial level or higher live  even if it costs extra  I would not live in a place with people of lower level then mine  Same is about eating out  I would  eat at restaurants of a certain level or  if I am short of time   take away and eat at home  I would pay attention to the comfort of my sleep  clothes that I wear  water that I drink   Humidity 15  is like on a plane  That s pretty low  it may feel like your throat is dry when you breathe  Staying inside with a humidifier and going outside into  a dry air puts your immune system in stress  I don t think it s worth any tax reduction   Are there other ways to reduce taxes ,2,1

The two places I would consider moving are Vancouver  WA  no state income tax  then you drive over to Portland  OR to shop because they have no sales tax   they do have Winter  but there is coastal humidity and rain    so they don t have to import water from elsewhere    and Saint Pete  FL   no state income tax  no tax on investment gains  and lots of humidity  My skin looks fantastic when I m down there  lol   I understand  as I have been in California since 1981  It is still a great state  in spite of all the shortcomings   It isn t easy to leave the place you have known most of your life  Best of luck  whatever you decide ,27,7

Love your perspective on water affecting your potential health issues  That s a great point of view that most CA exit video do not focus on  They only focus on tax saving strategies and the hype on the many reasons why they are leaving CALI but ignore possible invisible issues like the poor water condition and low humidity of their new destination  Kudos for raising these points ,38,4
TechLead  I agree with you on CAlif income taxes  If I stay here in retirement  I will hand over 10 11  in state income taxes until the day I die  compared to a no income tax state  That is larger than the expected stock market long term return  by a long shot  What am I getting here that is so much better  Edit  I watched til the end  Just working 10  harder is not a viable solution  if you want a balanced life  A non solution if you are retired  By that logic  if you cut back sleep  exercise  family  relaxation time by 10   you could be so much more productive  lol  then you re valuing   over time  which is another word for life  Oh  do some ROI research on water softeners  humidifiers  HVAC   they are cheap in comparison ,13,3

California coastal region around the Santa Barbara area is pretty sweet  Can still fly out to SF bay area as needed and a 2 hour drive to the LA basin if required   Las Vegas is a sespool  traffic is horrible in addition to the 110  heat during summer will absolutely suck the life out of you ,1,1

Mr Tech Lead  It is a nightmare  I moved in with family when I lost my 6 figure job in Orange Co Calif  I have aged soo many years and my skin is a wreck  I can t let myself give up   and I hope to move back to Calif   I grew up near Pasadena and I would love to move back there  I m not giving up and hoping  to retire in Ca   I m older now    and am having to accept my older years do not include a well planned retirement  This is why I have dived into Crypto I m determined to add to the limited fixed income that seems to be my future  I love all the crypto video guys because I believe I can make a supplemental income this way  Las Vegas is a true desert and does horrible things outside and inside  There is no way to counteract the dehydration  Hopefully I will be a little ol lady in Pasadena and living my most joyful life  I want to buy croking but somewhere am missing a step  Ciao for now     Lauren in Las Vegas  ps everyone is healthy in Italy   Bona serra    ,2,1

You are too comfortable living with your parents  But you have to realize you can t live with them forever  Sooner or later  you have to move on with your life  Sooner is always better than later trust me  The truth about getting out of your comfort zone is that it will not be comfortable at least not in the beginning  But you are supposed to adapt and solve the problems  Then you are able to enjoy a new life style  If you just run away whenever there s problems to solve  you are never getting out of your comfort zone  At least not voluntarily  Until you are forced to do it  then it will be 1000 times harder ,1,0

  I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Hudson Owen  ,100,6
If you re concerned about saving time when you visit the Bay Area   take a 1 5hr flight instead  Since you WFH  you can take the off peak flights and easily do it    You say the cost of having water softeners  humidifiers  skin moisturizers are too much but tax savings aren t actually enough to make you move   makes no sense  I use moisturizers and have a water softening system here in the Bay Area as well  Seems like everything is too much work for you and life is just a mathematical calculation  From that point of view  keep living with your parents,2,0

How to choose a city       Walkability   Cycling    Air quality    Climate      Crime    Transport options    Local laws    They re all related  If you have a city built for people to walk or cycle in the air quality is going to be much better  people aren t required to have a car to work to pollute the cities with vehicles or to have that financial burden on people that they need to buy and maintain a car to have a job  And despite better walking and cycling options if you read up on induced demand you ll see that it s no harder to get around in a car if you need to do it  lower car dependency means there are so many fewer cars on the road  Crime and local laws are also related  if you have harsh drug laws more people will by definition be criminals  if instead you can have a portion of the drug trade taxable that will just be overall better for the city  Climate should be one where you as a human can happily be outside for most of the year   The sunlight hours don t fall too low  the place is not an inhospitable desert or anything like that  Some place where humans were designed to live in     I would not consider most US or Canadian cities as they ve been bulldozed and built for the car  Half the city is just a parking lot which means polluted air and no walking or cycling anywhere  For that you need an older city that was built before the car  although in the past decade more cities have been starting to turn around in trying to plan cities to be more liveable by actual humans rather than cars and I ll expect in this regard things are going to improve globally in the coming decades     Homelessness is also a solvable issue  And it s more expensive to allow it to remain an issue than it is to put the resources in to solve it  Hence why there are many cities where it s not an issue ,14,3

Good video  I lived in Orlando  Sunnyvale and now in Las Vegas and hands down Las Vegas is the absolute WORST  For me it is not the water or that it is dry  it is the fact that it is the most boring city to live in  Once you have done the strip for the hundreds time and saw the Fremont street video ceiling over and over again  you realize that the city has nothing to offer but strip malls and very bad drivers on the road  The city has no character whatsoever  no little town centers to stroll and have a coffee  no public transportation that makes sense and a minimum of 3 4 hours to drive to NOT BE IN THE DESERT  I am just here because of my wife s job and family but California is hands down a million times better  Way more to do  ocean  mountains  green forests  charming little towns and if you do not like to live in San Francisco or Downtown LA  there are hundreds of nice little towns around  like Walnut Creek  Palo Alto  Sunnyvale  Los Gatos or even Livermore  Yes you have tax savings in Nevada  but if you are smart you know your way around that  However  no tax savings in the world can make up for the low quality of live in Las Vegas ,4,1

I have considered LV as well  One other issue is the LV housing market is very volatile  When LV housing tanked in 2008  Many LV owners were wiped out  Which created a sea of foreclosures due to massive supply   CA was bad too in 2008  But not as bad as NV  CA never has a surplus of homes like NV  So the damage is less  Good video  Thanks,3,3
If you have the money why don t you look into buying a house  You could add a water softener that would help with the hard water issue too  If you were worried about the look of aging probably the biggest thing you could do is stay out of the sun or limit your exposure  Everyone is different and how you react to a dry climate will differ  You shouldn t judge how something will be based on a minority of extreme cases ,6,1
I recently visited the area and was considering a move myself  However  the pay for my profession isn t much better and with a higher cost of living compared to where I m at now  I m glad you did this research as I have very dry skin ,21,1

while I certainly understand your reservations about Vegas  with the relatively equal cost of living for low crime areas  the dryness of the air being bad for you  the hard water issues  and all of the other negatives  I want to encourage you to consider actually leaving the US in its entirety   Puerto Rico doesn t really count because it is a us territory  and as you say  everything is exceptionally expensive because it s an island   but if you were to investigate some place like panama  where I currently live  you would find that it is an absolute bargain compared to the prices that you are paying in california   it also has high humidity and relatively soft water   Panama City is very near sea level  and thus ends up exceptionally hot for most of the year  and exceptionally humid  you will end up running your air conditioning there simply to avoid sweating to death   but if you were to secure a place up in the highlands  for example where I live at nearly 5 000 ft of elevation  the weather averages about 70 degrees year round in the daytime  and there is never any need for heating or air conditioning   it may very well be worth looking into  and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about different areas of the country  establishing permanent residency  and any number of other issues   for example  unlike places like Mexico and the philippines  you can own property in Panama even as a tourist   while citizenship is difficult to obtain here  much like everywhere else  lifelong permanent residency is absolutely easy to get   as for the cost of living  I can rent a two bedroom  two bathroom house  have high speed fiber optic internet  have all of the usual Netflix and Hulu and Amazon prime  eat high quality food and eat in restaurants  and pretty much have almost all of the other trappings of American Life except for things like shopping malls  and all of that on less than  2 000 per month   yes  for less money than you would pay for a one bedroom apartment in a bad area of vegas  you can fund your entire life for the month in panama   tax rates   territorial tax system means that you only pay taxes on the money that is derived from existing on Panamanian soil  absolutely nothing internet or crypto based is taxed by the Panamanian government   and once you have established your permanent residency here  which again is very easy to do and is literally lifetime permanent  then you qualify for the federal tax exemption on the first 108 000 of your personal income every year   which means that you are not only saving the 13 3  income tax rate from california  but you re also saving an additional 20 or 25  tax rate from not having to pay federal taxes   yes  I am completely serious about that and it is 100  absolutely legal   again  if you have any questions I will be happy to talk you through everything I have learned in the last 5 years of being here ,13,4

I wouldn t move into Vegas but I would move across the border  The issue with California isn t just the 13  income tax  It s property tax  gas tax  business restrictions  other restrictions  Humidity is a problem yes but I ve lived in the northern hemisphere and whole house humidifiers are not much to manage  Water softeners could be an issue but depending on how much one makes this is also a non issue ,1,1
The problem I have with Las Vegas is that there doesn t seem to be a real culture there   Everything is based upon the resorts   I like Florida a lot more ,12,2

I m actually in the process of hunting a house in Las Vegas right now   I d be moving from there from San Diego   It s exactly like you were saying  this is NOT the same San Diego as what I remember moving here too    I m sure it will only be a few more years before all of downtown is covered with one giant tarp   The gas lamp district used to be the most beautiful part of the city   Now I can feel safe walking through it   I can t stand the super left wing government and stupidly high income taxes either    Las Vegas is what I ve settled on   I haven t looked at apartments though so I can t say for them  but buying an actual house there is WAY cheaper than here in San Diego  so I can t help but feel it s too good of an opportunity  especially trying to lock in these super low rates  which are already starting to go back up quickly    I can live twice as good for half the price there compared to here   You mentioned 2 bedroom apartments  again  I haven t looked at those   but a  450 000 house with 5 bedrooms and 3 baths would only cost you around  2500 with today s interest rates on a 30 year fixed mortgage   Seems like a much better deal than a similarly priced apartment with only 2 bedrooms    You d still be living in the ghetto here in San Diego if you could only afford  450 000 for a house  Lmao    Actually  that s not all that funny    But you did bring up a great point about the humidity and water hardness   I m someone that cares probably too much about how I look and have skin problems as is  so now it has me at least thinking a bit harder about it    Idk lol   ,1,1

You left out worst case scenarios and natural disasters  First  living in a desert is the WORST place to live should there be a natural  or man made  disaster  Can you hunt  trap  and fish  Can you survive without a supermarket  What happens if something really terrible happens  At least if you lived somewhere like Northern Central Western Michigan or Northern   Central   Western Pennsylvania  you can find water and food  Washington  Oregon  and California are all big targets for North Korea  I m not sure I would live in any of those states  long term  income tax or not   Come to Ann Arbor  MI  You will like it ,4,1
Good point  natural disaster would hit the water and with really no natural water source it would become a battle field within days   Food everything would be out   Gas    Maybe that s why get plenty of prepers living around these areas   If anything stash a 5K gallon water tank under ground and you be all G   Good points for sure    didn t think about all this stuff     aging effects and all   Wow ,1,
