Dear TechLead     Your wife leaving you may seem like a negative event  but it could actually be the best thing that happened to your child  If Bitcoin strategy is all you analyze looking at people being raped  murdered  and tortured in Ukraine  you are quiet incapable of empathy and emotional connection  which are two essential ingredients for being a good parent  Can t imagine having a parent who thinks like that  But  that s just me ,2,2
I love your videos,1,1

Techlead seems to have many Psychopathic tendencies but tries to hide this with sarcasm from what I have seen from his content  It s probably a good thing his ex wife is not allowing him to see his child often  if he shows such a lack of empathy for children people in Ukraine then only god knows what he was like as a husband and a father ,2,1

Hi TechLead  you are a great guy  Investors are always looking for opportunities  A good investor sees opportunities at all time  Am not happy about the war in Ukraine and also about the good Russians who oppose the war  My perspective of the sentiment of the present market is   The stock  American  and Bond markets  are downward  for example  S and P 500  Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones  it s often a selloff for these three   There are huge   huge  buys in the energy market  Oil  gas and energy stocks  Also commodities like gold silver  wheat and others  The geopolitical tension spikes oil and gas prices  I do not need a geopolitical tension to identify opportunities   Inflation makes gold price to spike  FED plans to  crackdown on inflation through hiking rates beginning from this month of March  This could interfere with the present conditions  to regulate inflation  oil prices  but that may temporarily keep these assets down and boost the stock market and after a while before it begins moving in it s normal direction because of the geopolitical tension  More sanctions could interfere with this also as it did some days ago but it was temporary  Also Iran nuclear deal and lifting sanctions could interfere with the present market conditions  Research does suggest that the spike in bitcoin  prices reduced after China banned bitcoin  more also the uncertainty of the geopolitical tension keeps bitcoin price from appreciating much  presently most Cryptos are on downward trend  Anyone buying bitcoin or any valid Crypto  could invest what they can afford to lose  and hold for some years  about a decade ago  bitcoin purchased for  40  is worth about  360 million dollars  I do not suggest anyone trade the economics of the market blindly  but they ought to have it at the back of their mind  once they re see a very very clear opportunity  with confirmation  in the direction of the economics of the market then they trade it  Also this does not exclude good risk management  More also no one should over leverage their trades  The market does not continue to move in a certain direction for ever  Overbought and Oversold regions  expect market to retrace   Everyone has their style of trading  whatever style seem best to anyone and it brings profits   that  is the goal  Anyone trading does that at their own risk  Happy investments  The conditions of the market can change  and is always changing  Trading the economics of the market is one of the various strategies  If anyone loves to trade the economics of the market  listening to business news  CNBC  Bloomberg and others   is super important ,1,

Come on guys    Care less about the title of this video  WAR    This is good for Bitcoin  it s a very smart title to cause controversy   which yields more views and commits  However  the bottom line of this video is  War is acting as catalyst for the MASS ADOPTION of Cryptos  Therefore  it s good for Bitcoin  mainly  and other Cryptos of course  Yes  war is no good for anyone  specially the ones within Ukraine   Russia  but finally people started to acknowledge the real value and philosophy of Bitcoin ,1,1

 I know nothing about Russia or Ukraine    Well many of us do  Maybe don t throw around wild claims if you haven t done any research  You sound like a complete fool ,3,1

Excellent video and analysis  100  agreement re  crypto and its place in modern day warfare  LFG  Wrt Biden  I d only say we elected the lesser of two evils  The choices sucked  and yes he is a weak leader  In many ways  he paved the way for Putin by setting the global expectation  That said  Putin doesn t get a hall pass here  he s not an innocent aggressor just because opportunity presented itself ,1,0
So you admit that you don t know anything about Russia and Ukraine and about this war  but still are so passionate to somehow condemn Biden and the people who elected him for this war  Absolute idiocy ,1,0
 Virtue signalling on Twitter     yet it is techlead who is on Twitter saying that Ukraine brought the war on themselves  sharing images that say  Ukraine should surrender  and including hashtags for both IStandwithUkraine and IStandwithRussia  basically trolling off the back of a war to generate social media traffic with no consideration for the humanitarian crisis  He s all about himself   making money no matter what   Would he behave the same if it was China invading Taiwan where I believe he originates and perhaps still has some ties  Given how low he has sunk I really wound not be surprised at all if he did ,1,0
What do you think is going to happen if Russia tries to use Crypto to circumvent sanctions  Crypto ist going to get banned in the western hemisphere   But you can t ban Bitcoin  I hear the cryptobros lament  true  you can t but you can ban exchanges and this will happen simultaneously in all allied nations which will crash Bitcoin like the Rubel  The ignorance  naivete and outright stupidity of moonboys surprises me again and again ,1,1
You really don t know then what is bitcoin  It doesn t matter what exchange you use ,1,

You are the same as Putin if you earn from the suffering of others,1,0
The people destroyed the world   the people destroy everything  merely based upon what they hear and react merely upon emotions   The Media is the easiest way of manipulating and stirring up the audience because it s made up to believe that is the magnum opus of factual knowledge  Trump was a BELOVED ICON in literally every culture  then all of a sudden he became president then the news and critics distorted his image to make him out to be an all around evil person  It s so sad but call me crazy   it feels as if a lot of or if not most of these events are set up to force some of these agendas   I sound like a crazy theorist or something haha,1,0
I can t understand you with the wonton in your mouth ,1,0
War is bad  People are die   1  NATO is defense organization and don t attack Russia   2  Russia and NATO already has same borders Poland  of course Belarus is officially not a Russia but technically yes   Latvia  Estonia  Lithuania   3  By the way USA as NATO  Alaska  is less than 200 miles by the Russia territory  Chukchi    4  Russia is a aggressor    So not   war is good for Bitcoin  but  SANCTIONS ,1,0

 While bitcoin s wild price movements might seem random  they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets  Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance  it s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Robin Moore to invest in bitcoin    Keeping all this in mind  it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world  Mrs Robin Signals has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 9 BTC lately   ,2,0

People saying that Biden is not responsible are the problem        HE LITERALLY GAVE THE WAR TO PUTIN  Trump had Russia in a choke hold financially   through oil and logistic prices   Grow up and seek information for yourself and quit letting your uncle that is watching CNN tell you whats going on when the NEWS is the ENEMY of the people   Scary times we are living in  ESPECIALLY with tech being controlled by rich biased politicians that want to move their detrimental ideologies through tech ,2,0
I bet this guy doesn t have any friends  ,1,1
I agree with you wholeheartedly      The fact is that BTC is the future of cryptocurrencies  and traders are now wondering if this is the right time to invest    Before you come to a conclusion  you should look at things first  In recent days  the price of BTC has been fluctuating  which means that the market is currently unstable and it is impossible to say whether it will go down or up    While others continue to trade without fear of losses  others are patient  It all depends on the pattern you are trading and also the source of your signals    I would say that trading is going smoothly for me  I started with 2 5 BTC and in just three weeks I have accumulated over 13 6 BTC  Thanks to Alex Valentino  i trade using his signals and I would advise the newbie to do the same too ,258,16

While bitcoin s wild price movements might seem random  they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets  Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance  it s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Aaron Addison to invest in bitcoin    Keeping all this in mind  it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world  Aaron Signals has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 11 BTC lately   ,506,11

At this point  we should all take advantage of the dip  The fact is crypto is the future and the question most traders ask themselves is   if this is right time to invest  I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in this space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into tradng  since it is way profitable than hodling  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 8 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from Harney Valfredo   I would advise you all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about  Say hello to Harney    ,65,5

 Darth Saithus I guess not because it s hard to argue objective facts,1,
 Darth Saithus can you respond to my comment,2,
 Darth Saithus ok kiddo whatever you say  Maybe when you grow up you ll realise that just being the country with the strongest  or at least one of  military doesn t mean most important and by far not best lol  Free healthcare  free education  world best education  strong and stable currency  low homelessness rate  near 0 murder rate  Those are all things you guys do not have but other countries  like Switzerland where I m from do  Before you carry on your rampage  that doesn t mean that I dislike the USA or think it s bad  I ve been there many times for vacation and I really like it  The point I m trying to make  is that Americans some times have the tendency to think more of them selves as they actually are and that s a thing I don t like,4,
 Darth Saithus yes I ve read it and it perfectly reflects your country s average IQ of 80  Great job kid,2,

 Darth Saithus dumbest thing I ve red all year,6,
 Darth Saithus For some reason my comment doesn t post if I have the links in it   I d argue the Commonwealth of Nations has far more widespread cultural and economic influence than the US    In terms of poverty rates  y all got 67 countries ahead of you in that regard   Google world population review poverty rate by country  Some key countries ahead of you include Portugal  Sweden  Israel  Switzerland  Japan  Poland  Belgium  Germany  Turkey  Netherlands  France  Austria  Ireland  Norway  Russia  Denmark  Australia  Hungary  Finland  Canada and even Indonesia  I m willing to bet most of them have working public health care systems too  The US has literally some of the poorest citizens for how rich the country is thanks to your emphasis on extreme right capitalism   Is it a global capital of freedom tho  Based on what metric   Google freedom house countries   territories  This lists 62 countries ahead of you with the score broken down into political rights and civil liberties  The only people that risk their lives to get there are refugees who don t care where they go as long as they get away from their war stricken home    The one thing I can say America excels in is national pride  and like kudos to you  but do you really think the 7 6 other billion people on Earth aren t trying their best to create the best life for themselves and others as you are  Your national pride is so much that you get to the point of thinking the world and its decisions actually revolve around you lol,7,

Oh man  I was really enjoying your content  heck I even recommended you in my  IT phil  community  But this has gone far too far for me  I am really sorry    An other point of view slighty related to your topic s   There is no such a thing as passive income for everyone  Every cent you make more somebody paid for  So if your goal is to increase the wealth of one group  let s say your followership  another group has to pay for  You don t create wealth from nothing you are doing this on the back of other people  I am not sure how close to reality these sterotypes are but since ultra capitalism has its origins in the us  I would guess the people  over there  are getting this in a different way  maybe some of you guys want to elaborate  For me   as a european tech lead   this seems really unfair and destructive against the human species as a whole    I hope you get better soon  sincerely a former fan ,67,3
 There is no such a thing as passive income for everyone  Every cent you make more somebody paid for     This isn t true  if you invest in a company s stock that will give them more capital which they could use to buy machinery  fund research   development and further expand operations  making everyone involved that much richer  If Tesla didn t have access to funds gathered from public investors it would have gone bankrupt long ago and all the innovations would have never occurred  Of course Tesla isn t the only company on the stock market  just a current example     This has been true since the advent of modern capitalism which enabled the industrial revolution  in other words  the world isn t a zero sum game ,1,

There s always two sides to a coin and the one you forget to mention is those sanctioning russia will stand by that  If Bitcoin truly is such an easy  escape route to any sanctions   which it won t be   you bet the countires will crack down on their attempts of escaping the imposed sanctions  Things aren t as simple as  Russia keeps living as before despite sanctions thanks to Bitcoin   and I truly hope noone hopes for that to be happening   would seem incedibly short sighted ,20,9
 Louis Guerpillon yes this is how it affects Bitcoin when you buy food or gas with   dollars it is expensive when you buy food with Bitcoin food is cheaper and so is gas  To understand this Bitcoin is deflationary if you cannot get your LIZARD BRAIN to understand this you will keep buying thing s with the DOLLAR    cheers,1,
We need to get out of the mindset of  People buying bitcoin   good  no matter what   if you re sincerely in it for the long run  it s time to actually look inte the politics and any other dimensions that encompass this  Your TA and expertise will fly right out the window once countries goes harder on crypto IF this supposed  dream scenario  plays out ,3,

I think it s high up time but At this point  we should all take advantage of the dip  The fact is  NFTs   BTC is the future of crypto and the question most traders ask themselves is   if this is right time to invest  I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in this space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into tradng  since it is way profitable than hodling  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 15 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from Harney Valfredo   I would advise you all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about        moorerobin   VIA Te le gra m        ,4,0

  I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Hudson Owen   ,69,7
The amount of bots in these chats are getting too much lmao,1,
  TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems  It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC   More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  I have made over 11 btc from day tradng with FADWA  insights and signals in less than 2 weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish   ,94,5

This video is a sad excuse for a joke  As a matter of fact  every video you made since spearheading the Million Token scheme seems to be trapped in the crypto echo chamber without any substance  The idea that Russia can evade sanctions by leveraging crypto is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who understands the technology even on a superficial level  Sure they can get paid with Bitcoin  but then what  Every transaction is public  and you need to exchange your coins to buy anything useful  maybe Russian companies can do some commerce with North Korea  or El Salvador  but every other country will just blacklist the coins and barre exchanges from converting them to fiat  and China already banned BTC altogether    I used to love your authentic  hilarious videos  Now you re becoming just another  crypto bro   Get out of the echo chamber and say something interesting  or not  either way  your share of my attention span is on a severe downtrend ,1,2

The regular lending rates on  FTX are quite good compared to most banks  but they fluctuate by the hour  and also intra hour  but you re generally not paid for that   Meanwhile staking is a set yearly amount that seldom changes  but then you have to find a good entry and bare the risk that entails  On the other hand  I consider the opportunity cost of not owning crypto these days to be much of a much higher risk  That is to say  I think  not  owning crypto is far more risky than owning it  due to various things not limited to stupid fiscal policies and Fed money printing  So the best is owing it  trading and investing with it  I learned that from a crypto expert from Neil Voss I ve made tons of profits btw  You can reach Neil Voss on  eI    m Voss44,24,7

Today was great as crypto natives donated a whopping 500k to Ukrainian army to show as solidarity for this bogus war which has led to massive selloff across the board  While I believe that bitcoin should rally today the market has been prepped to tank hard before a reversal because Based on the price action alone  if this support fails to hold  there are higher chances of BTCUSD throwback continuing downwards into the 33 34k USD demand zone which was the bottom today   That being said  as of now bitcoin has considerable chances of an upside pullback into the 40 42k USD area  where the main resistances line up together  Eventually  the charts tell the story as it is  Yet  more often than not  major swings in the markets come from the external factors  I notice a lot of traders point towards erroneous data points to make trading decisions  And sometimes with extreme confidence Part of being a good trader means understanding which data points are actual signal  making Career trader Callum Lucas my most preferred choice thanks to his automated s gnalsalgo which are based on unique combinations of trend momentum volume scanners and onchain analytics in which I ve accumulated over 7 9BTC since employing his Algo for my trades   If interested then reach out at TeLe G  m  callumlucas,50,2

I was laughing loud weeks ago when the western world threatened Russia to kick them out of the dying swift banking system   which is basically Russian rocket fuel for Bitcoin and the entire market  Couldn t agree more,96,4
Somehow I doubt the world is willing to go against NATO to trade with Russia using a digital currency that fluctuates the way bitcoin does,3,
and they still didn t kick him out  despite the full invasion,2,

Someone should productify financial sanctions  Hence  selling an automated bot that loots the bank account of policymakers and lawmakers  distribute the fiat money to voters  BTC accounts provided that they refuse to use their right to vote  Another bot would be a refund of government life insurance and termination of these contracts  It s time for financial engineering  Technically  it s legal chaos by the way  It s not a war in legal terms  There is an imminent need for actually smart contracts  quite obviously  automated scripts  ,2,0

This is a disgusting title  I m from Ukraine ,2,1
TechLead  respect   I m one who believes that the best way to arm  not a pun  oneself against tyranny is knowledge of history   If you know your knowledge of European history is weak  why wouldn t you shore up that ignorance with some knowledge   The current geopolitical situation was and continues to be avoidable   But it will take strong people willing to do more than talk   You re right about that   We need to speak plainly and with clarity   It will have a powerful effect on others and allow things to return to normalcy knowing people will not tolerate the loss of their liberties without a fight   I could go on but I have a rule about rants   I m buy BitCoin like there s no tomorrow    I m just sayin  ,4,1

 Moon  chaser17 Everything was so much cheaper under Trump  it was great  I didn t have to pay  4 00 a gallon  about the price per gallon in New York and Connecticut  where I live  ,1,
 kebman Gas in south Texas is 27 38 NOK right now or  3 09 USD per gallon   We are close to refineries though   It s a lot higher in other parts of the country   We have enough oil in the US to supply us and our allies   Opening up our pipelines and drilling would be  bad for the Environment    In the last few years  we are more worried about what pronouns people want to be called by instead of making our country strong      What did Norway think of President Trump ,3,
 Moon  chaser17 In Norway 1 litre of gasoline costs around 18 NOK today on 25 February 2022  Also today 1 USD is worth about 8 98 NOK  18 NOK   8 98    2 00 for 1 litre of gasoline  1 gallon is 3 78541 litres  So the price of 1 gallon of gasoline is 3 78541 litres    2 00    7 60 per gallon   ,1,
its true they live in their bubble,7,
You don t need to know where they are  when your paying  7 00 for a gallon of gas  you starting waking up to how things work ,8,

At this point  we should all take advantage of the dip  The fact is  NFTs   BTC is the future of crypto and the question most traders ask themselves is   if this is right time to invest  I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in this space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into tradng  since it is way profitable than hodling  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 19 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from Lawrence Watson    I would advise you all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about ,13,7

Evaluate Russia Extremely  get Ukraine to join nato immediately after he got elected      But if it wasn t for coofy coofy I think priorities could have been put on other matters like this      But I don t know politics or America      But steps could have been taken to prevent an outright war between countries     Everyone would go begging USA for it s forces     And well these lead to casualties      Prevention is better than cure    ,1,
