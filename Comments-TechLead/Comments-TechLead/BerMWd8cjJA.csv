I realized that the secret to making a million is making better investment   I always tell myself you don t need that new Car or that vacation just yet and that mindset helps me make more money invest   ng   For example last year I invested 70k in blue chip stocks and crypt0 s   with the help of my advisor of course   and made about 380k   but guess what   I put it back and traded with her again and now I m rounding up close to a million   Delayed gratification always pays off,117,20

There s more to buying assets than Just Fundamental Analysis  Fundamental Analysis has its place   but you need to follow the historical price movement  and trade with the institutional investors as they are the ones who move the Market    You also need to use stop losses   so you don t keep losing money       Be Disciplined,86,7

There is ALWAYS a way to make money in this market  While the market has not been set to easy mode recently  there are still nft to flip  solid coins to stake  IDOs to ape into  trades to make  yields to farm  Never stop hustling for those gains ,1,

Although  I have interests in global economics I don t watch the news anymore    I have enough FUD lol   Thanks for this news and offering your insight on how to navigate during unfortunate times events like this   You re right about keeping level headed when investing so that s why I think it s important to limit the amount of FUD we consume   I don t watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if I were to watch the news everyday   Now I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 23  btc from day trading with Jenna Twartz Signal in few weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish   ,62,8
 Hello everyone   I m what I d consider to be a fairly new investor   or person practising stock and crypto investment   y stuff at least   My mother practiced some way back when   including some dividend investment Ethereum crypto trading also and that sorta line of things     She has been helping me a little with my journey     Telling me to focus on tangible assets and stay away from shitcoins and startup investment in my portfolio and the like   Personally I don t see anything wrong with that but honestly I don t vibe with it right anyways so     but   She has petrified me on starting my New portfolio this year  Telling me I have to keep it extremely perfect   written neatly   kept nice and everything   I m not a tidy writer   Never have been   With shaky hands and bad spelling   and so of course I m TERRIFIED to start making certain analysis on paper because I don t want to ruin it or mess it up   I don t really know what to do   Thank you for reading my tangent   what I have to ask is   How do I go about this all  am I able to even start with outsiders assistance or professional help so I can figure out what and how to do it all nicely    I came across a professional name LeonardDouglas  ,4,12

Investing in crypto is not like putting your money in a savings account that pays 10  annualy  Returns will fluctuate from year to year  some times dramatically  The 10  return is only an average of some bang up years and some gut wrenching years ,69,4
Exactly  that expression  buy back your time  well thats what investing allows you to do ,2,
Great content  It s so surprising how people buy crypto and store  What then is  the reason of buying without investing it and making profit  Meanwhile making profit in crypto and forex at large requires you investing and as a beginner  you ll need an expert who would guide you while making investments because trading crypto ain t really easy as some people might think  You might end up running losses without proper guidance and mentoring from an expert  Raised over 16 BTC when I started at 2 BTC in just few weeks implementing PAUL SINGH daily trading signals and tips ,168,14
Trading with Paul Singh daily signals really changed my perspective about bitcoin because why everyone was complaining and scared  I watched my portfolio grow from 2 BTC to 8 BTC in the space of 3 weeks with active trading,2,
The Reason why I trade with Paul singh s signal is because they are always accurate and helps even when the market is crashing,4,

Paul Singh has helped a lot of traders   newbies out there  and with their program one can recover losses from crash so quickly,2,
I started trading with his signals with 0 2 BTC  two months ago and i have earned approximately 5 3 BTC  Its all about knowing what strategy to apply and when ,3,
 Nikmah islahah That s sad  i totally understand  i actually lost too at the early stage and then i had someone to manage my account and i watched his strategy and how he does it  PAUL SINGH has been my mentor and i trade using his daily signals,3,
You re right  I have lost alot trading all by myself without a guide  It s been an uneasy ride for me  Who is your mentor please  I actually don t mind paying,3,
2 months ago I had no idea what Crypto is  Now I have  26 000 in BTC and ETH  I still don t have much idea what Crypto is  But I have a big hunch  An expert trader is the key when it comes to success in crypto trading,4,
I agree with you  In my own experience  I have come to realize it s risky and not profitable to hold coins while waiting for the Bull Run  Trading btc and alt has become a lucrative way of making money ,3,
I m new to crypto trading what s the best way to get started with trade cos I ve been making my personal research for a while now  i don t know how to trade on cryptocurrency ,24,12

The  Bitcoin price has completed several bullish movements over the past week that may confirm a new bullish expansion phase which is about to begin   Eyes are still on what happens above the current local highs  not below  even as BTC price action is up 6  in a week  We cannot predict bottoms  but it was obvious things were getting ready to go down  Why are people JUST NOW realizing the market is bearish  Extremely bearish  Point is  be patient  and just trade to build capital for when we do bottom  Don t let these institutions destroy you  And my advice  don t spread yourself thin with too many coins  Market moves as a whole right now  red days mean red days for almost everything  Green Days will be the same  Paper gains and losses are normal throughout the investing cycle  Continue to invest and trade  don t panic     Still love the trading techniques and advice   Digital currencies continue to reshape the world globally  It s hard for anyone who is against it right now  But from a trader s point of view  I think we really need more experts in this field to give newbies a sense of how the community works  I was able to easily increase my portfolio in just  trading with Elsa Helwig daily signals growing 0 5 BTC to 1 1 BTC  His  daily signals are very accurate and yields a great positive return on investment and is available to give assistance to anyone who love crypto trading  you can contact Elsa Helwig for inquires and profitable trading systems on Telegram    investwithelsa      for any crypto related issues ,1,1

It s okay to buy the dip but in crypto it s more important to buy into actually solid projects  Because if we look at the past  a lot of the coins from the 2017 bull run completely died and never recovered  Personally  during these times I prefer to diversify and hold mostly onto larger coins that are in the top 30 ,54,9

then invest in the mid cap low cap projects that are really great and promising at a good low  price so that you get to get back some decent gains   Then you use most of the profits again and repeat but be careful and analyze for the best ones out there ,1,

So  I don t say I understand this correctly  but if I do     I can lend other people my crypto coins on this plattform for up to 40 50  interest  So  what is the downside  In the ordinary finance world  a 40 50  interest also means a equally high risk for the lender not being able to fulfill his her obligations ,2,7

Not that I know of  Even if there was such a platform I would not recommend using one bc you are just adding another contract vulnerability on top of the DEFI contracts you invest in  Example  lets say you want to invest in YETIxxx DeFi  for high yield  and you use some third party to invest ib YETIxxx  Now you have the risk of that third party contract AND the YETIxxx risk  Also you end up aggregating all of your Defi investments in to a single point of failure  If that third party platform that makes investing EASY fails  is hacked or rugs then all of your investments are at risk  DeFi is risky enough i personally would not add to that by using a platform that makes it easy or convenient  All the best,1,
