I ve been listening to your videos for a while now  I respect your opinion on digital currency and how insightful you can be  I ve been apprehensive on joining any group that involves money for sharing knowledge   I have stuck my feet in the water a few times and I just can t stand the gimmicks used to get people to bite  I ve decided to dip my toe in this time with you  Please be patient with me  I m not a dumb dumb by any means  but I m slower on the financial side  I ll am willing to do the work  So I guess I ll see you on the inside  Stephanie,1,

I have tried 5 programs and pattern including Cash FX before reaching out to Mark  I can swear his program is the best for now,4,
 Mario Long Yes I agree with you What matters is getting yourself a good Trader or company that knows how to manage an account and make huge profits and Mark has really been a good Broker,3,

Agreed on your analysis here  Price action wise Bitcoin has been trading inside an ascending triangle with higher lows and lower highs towards an invisible apex  On the S R side price is now displaying two main levels  the main level to reclaim remains 46K 33K  A break below the second one  may imply further chances for reaching the target in the south at the swing low  I underwent a series of trading losses I d best not talk about before being introduced to Mr  Callum Lucas  His careful guide and employing his Signal strategies for my trades has been a great experience  Callum s signal algorithm based on unique combinations of trend momentum volume scanners I ve accumulated over 11 Btc in 7weeks ,6,9
     thanks to him he made me choose the right decision by doing bitcoin during the pandemic   it remains the best decision I ever made in my life so far ,1,

Was watching the video for DeFi insights and then you just derailed it to russian propaganda  You call the war crimes agains Ukrainian people    russians defend themselves   At least you lifted the mood a little by reading russian troll comments as a words of wisdom   that was hilarious  And let me guess   in a true russian supportist manner   this comment will get deleted  What a shame ,1,1
You  like most people  did not take the time to do your research and judge people on the outside  Zelensky is a Lawyer too  before he was a comedian  and he is super smart with lots of integrity  You thinking he should give up on protective his own country sovereignty for  saving the people  is what Russia and China wants  nor what Ukrainian people want  Allowing a tyrant to take over your own country only easily throws all the people of that country into hell  Read history  learn about other dictators  Lenin  to see what they did do  Putin is a criminal a manic a paranoid  And you think he will treat Ukrainians well if they would be surrendered and slaved    That s a joke  You may know crypto  but know nothing  or are brainwashed like many others out there  about people s rights and freedoms  their needs and psychology   nor do you seem to know much about the damage of dictators and tyrants  check out those in history including the Chinese ones   You are supporting the crimes and genocide in Russia  which has no excuse  Terrorism  dictatorship and Aggression on any country is wrong  He who controls the world is Satan ,1,0

Great video and some nice tips  This is a scary time for new investors but the best thing you can do is not to make decisions based on emotions  This could actually be a good time to buy more of your high conviction stocks or crypto on a discount  Wealth is created during bear markets  not bull markets  If your portfolio is really effecting your mental health then delete the app and go for a walk  Let the market do its thing and have a long time horizon  I buy and just trade long term more than ever  I have made over 16  btc from day trading with Ruby Benally in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearishy,553,10

Thank you for the video  the investment part  But your opinion about Ukraine and Russia conflict really is on an un informed base  Ukraine and President Zelensky in particular do not want to join Nato EU by any cost  But we need real guarantees for the security of the country which have been violated back in 2014 by Russia  the country which was one of the security guarantors by Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances  And there are many other aspects  You have a huge audience and have no right to say suggest spread opinion about so sensitive topic and what Ukrainian should do or should not do  when you did not inform yourself enough ,3,1
stick to crypto  you are biased when it comes to politics ,2,1

Love the crypto take   but does Putin really need to  defend  Russia  I think not  He will be out soon by his own people  he is done  He just blocked social media in Russia  that says a lot  Ukraine has a right to remain a sovereign country  Putin has a history of taking smaller regions by force  no wonder Ukraine wants NATO support ,1,0

Looking at the Global markets you can see that we are heading with for a recession as oil prices continue to soar which to me is a good buying opportunity to buy Bitcoin as future hedge  Looking at the price action of bitcoin  its moving in the local horizontal movement levels after rejecting the upper volatility based zone  The peak candlestick is equipped with relatively long upper shadow candle which in the context of the average volatility implies a short term weakness and the selling pressure appear which will see it move to towards the mean which sits at 40k currently  This did not come out as a surprise  because that area was defined as a potential rejection zone as analyzed by  Trader name   His call analysis of the market has been spot on using his automated signals for my entries which has virtually saved my portfolio from cascading liquidations during wild volatility periods of uncertianty  Started with little over 2BTC  so far I ve made over 9 5BTC using his algorithm  If interested then reach out at TeLe G  m  callucas,49,2

While I hope this doesn t happen of course  any thoughts  techlead on why the US would not ban or significantly over regulate all crypto if it s a way to get around traditional banking and monetary systems  making sanctions less powerful  or even meaningless   Wouldn t they try to hold onto that power by eliminating the non traditional competitors  Not trolling here   truly trying to understand why that s not the obvious big picture move ,3,1

Thank you for your videos mate  The BTC shows us that when he wakes up he knows how to do it and destroy all the bears   Never go against the trends on cryptos  even less put levers  it is about the immediate sanction as soon as you turn your back  now anyone who has been in the crypto space for the last 6 or more years certainly knows about the cycle structure  every 4 yearsBTC goes through a halving even where the amount of Bitcoin that is mined is cut half  Well  the block reward is cut in half  this cause huge price spikes every 4 yrs because it create a supply and demand crisis that can t be priced in until it s a reality   but all thanks to Charlotte Irene Smith who taught me how to make trade and increased my Crypto from 8 to 21BTC now  No one really knows what is going to happen in the market  and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past  It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own Investment choices based on their own research   ,27,4

The fact that BTC continues to bleed is really scary  and traders are now wondering if this is the right time to invest    before you come to a conclusion  you should look at things first  In recent days  the price of BTC has been fluctuating  which means that the market is currently unstable and it is impossible to say whether it will go down or up  While others continue to trade without fear of losses  others are patient  It all depends on the pattern you are trading and also the source of your signals  I would say that trading is going smoothly for me  I started with 2 5 BTC and in just few weeks I have accumulated over 9 6 BTC  using the trading strategy from my coach Rodney glen  ,2,6

If you can accumulate Bitcoin anywhere from  35K    41K you ll be in good shape  You can feel free to invest however much you like every week  I d say if you can hit a target of investing  100 a week into the liquidity pair between Wrapped Bitcoin and USDC  you ll be good  It s better to buy a huge chunk when there s a dip though  That s more effective than dollar cost averaging Bitcoin  However  it s hard to time the market so just buy weekly  Buy less when the price is high and in the green and buy more when the price is low and in the red  I would do  75 a week when it s in the green and  125 a week when it s in the red ,2,

I totally agree with what you re saying    the fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first   for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you can t tell if it s going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making loss  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade  and also the source of your signals  I would say trading has been going smoothly for me  I started with 2 5BTC and I have accumulated over 7 11BTC in just three weeks with the help given by expert trader Edward Samuel Michelson ,75,8

I respect the work you put into your videos  I find it truly baffling that all the major crypto youtubers just look at the pure waves and completely ignore the larger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the outlook for the future may not be as rosy as it looks  it seems  It s a bit irresponsible to ignore the fact that every ETF launch so far has caused a major spike in BTC s spike  Already on shaky ground with historically low volumes and near pure whale pumps  we narrowly avoided a long term bear market  This is the worst time in history to invest as many are not backing up their crypto assets  More attention should be paid to day trading as it is less affected by market unpredictability   I earned over 11 BTC  from day trading with Tilo polter  ideas and signals in less than 2 weeks with people around me have been extremely successful with day trading signals from Mr Tilo polter  It s one of the best tools to protect your wealth in case it starts to decline   eI    m   Tilopolter Signals ,38,5

I respect the work you put into your videos  I find it truly baffling that all the major crypto youtubers just look at the pure waves and completely ignore the larger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the outlook for the future may not be as rosy as it looks  it seems  It s a bit irresponsible to ignore the fact that every ETF launch so far has caused a major spike in BTC s spike  Already on shaky ground with historically low volumes and near pure whale pumps  we narrowly avoided a long term bear market  This is the worst time in history to invest as many are not backing up their crypto assets  More attention should be paid to day trading as it is less affected by market unpredictability   I earned over 11 BTC  from day trading with Axel Winston  ideas and signals in less than 2 weeks with people around me have been extremely successful with day trading signals from m  AXEL WINSTON  It s one of the best tools to protect your wealth in case it starts to decline   eI    m  AXELWINSTON  SIGNALS ,236,5

Hi TechLead  I really enjoyed this video  it gave me a lot to think about   Especially the part about action  not motion    However  if I understood you correctly  you compared Zelenskyy s hardline stance as reducing the chances for a win win situation with Russia   As you had learned in negotiating conflicts in a tech company earlier  hard line positions greatly diminish win win possibilities   I think a weakness in this reasoning is that comparing negotiating and conflict resolution to situations where both parties are subordinates to a higher authority does not always translate to situations where there is no higher authority   In your tech company the supervisors could appreciate employees who seek out win win   But imagine yourself  let s say  at a campground where there are only two campers  I realize the Park Regulations and State authorities are the superordinates in this case    The other camper approaches you and says he wants you stay in the  campground for three days   You say your family plans to leave after one day  you have to work tomorrow   He repeats he needs you to stay put 3 days  so you remind him that the decision is up to you  not him   He pulls a gun  takes your family s cell phones  and says he has the power to tell you to stay  and if you try to leave he will kill you and dispose of your family   The authorities will never even know you were here   At your tech company the company would not permit this   But in international relations there is no higher authority   What is your opportunity for a win win with this camper   Isn t Russia telling Ukraine  since I can t trust you to ask for NATO membership  I will take you prisoner and you will learn to like it ,8,5

Thanks for the tip on crypto  but I really think you ve got a bad take on the conflict  Neutrality is no option for them as Putin has basically given them an ultimatum  Allign with us  or face conflict   They want their independence  and they want to be free from Russian meddling  There was never any viable diplomacy  and history has proven that ,4,0

Excellent and insightful   thank you    however  for folks like myself who are almost ready to re max their bitcoin commitment with a long term view  an alternative timeline is the Fed raises rates  dollar rises  jobs disappear  inflation drops  and bitcoin trend goes negative with lots of expensive bounces to lower highs  for the next 4 to 8 months ,6,1

I guesstimated owning Bitcoin in 2017 was comparable to owning spice in the Dune universe but never thought it would come to full fruition   Not only is TechLead well versed in the degenerative nature of common lay people  he must also be very well familiar with playing Dune II using DOS back in the 90 s where you can hire additional mercenaries for combat in war and such using spice  Much like spice  the options now are infinite with crypto  You can buy transfer crypto and do whatever the hell you want these days ,8,0

Great video and I agree 100  that you need news sources from different angles  About Ukraine like to be part of Europe is fully understandable if you choose for the democratic values  You choose to be part of a bigger whole to have business and security  Russia has enough time to change into a more open society where all people could fully develop  Unfortunately they choose differently with Putin in power  For me you can compare it with the US and Canada  they both speak English but the US wouldn t be happy if Canada was coming in to take over some piece of the country and say it is how it use to be in the past ,10,1
Logarithmic Growth Curve shows that 100k is obsolet  Looking forward to May we should see 150 k to 200 k and the longer it takes the higher it gets  For Example  a peak in Nov Dec 2022 could result in BTC 200k to 250K  On the other side Crypto could collpase to almost 0,1,7

This is a nice summary and indeed it s a possible scenario  But haven t seen to be considered the fact that the Russian economy is stalled  30  inflation  10  recession  majority of the online payments are blocked  the banking system collapsed  People are waiting in long queues at the banks to withdraw their money  and most probably a big part of these savings are already lost  The money transfer is blocked from both directions  Until this situation is not resolved I don t expect too big moves in the crypto prices driven by the Russian situation  and hard to predict what will happen after  It s good to keep the eyes on the prices  but it s looks too early to make the bets ,1,0

Lol  Ukraine might get stronger but EU will get weaker  Just stop this senseless war  If Ukraine wants to become a better and stronger nation then go a head they don t need EU or NATO to do so  Zelenzky is doing good PR  but he has risked his entire nation and its population for what  To gain some economical funds  Is it worth it  No  especially since he knew that they would never be granted access from the beginning  as long as Russia s leaders are so much against it and with a finger on the nukes ,1,0

I share your opinion on Zelensky and Ukraine  My way or highway will not achieve anything  He was way to optimistic to think that EU will someone accept them as EU state  Ukraine will end up completely broken  Any smart leader in Ukraine would be looking for their people and play it smart on both sides  Provoking Russia with inviting Nato  building US BIO labs  etc  is not a way to go  USA will come out as winner from this  yet again  They will wait until Ukraine is completely broken  They will buy everything there for nothing  Also they have narrative to continue pushing on Russia to install their puppet ,1,0

I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making loose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 4 7BTC and i have accumulated over 17 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Hirion Noah,15,4
Excellent insight   thanks bro ,1,0
I M JUST WONDERING HOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD CAN BUY BITCOIN AT THE SAME TIME WITH SUCH A SMALL SUPPLY,4,1
If I m not mistaken  the more people that buy BTC the higher the price of BTC goes  So it s an ever increasing scale where you need to invest more to get the same amount of bitcoin and unless you have money to throw away most people can t afford to invest so much  You also have to consider when bitcoin prices go up people will inevitably want to  cash out  thus putting more bitcoin back into the market ,1,
Finally  somebody have done his homework   I was getting irritated by all this youtubers who became masters of politics and its dirty game in just overnight when they can t even question themselves the fact that their information sources were only one sided  GOD ,4,2

Hi Patrick  I like your coding videos  I really appreciate for those coding suggestions and way of thinking   For Bitcoin  I think you can attractive more viewers and followers by making suggestions about when is the good time to sell bitcoin   Most investors make loss money  because they do dont know when to sell their stocks rather than when to purchase stocks  Especially for Bitcoin speculators who want to make some cash in a week or so   if someone is investing in bitcoin for long term  then any short term market fluxion doesn t matters     One example from your previous video  a few weeks before superball   in that video you suggested to buy Bitcoin  because major bitcoin platforms have spent a lot of money on NFT bitcoin ads during the superball show  so they will boost the bitcoin price up  When you release the video the market price for Bitcoin is about 41000   and the pick price before super ball is around 44000  but the price drop to 40000 within a few days  Therefore  it is very important to tell your readers when is a good time to sell Bitcoin   I know this could be much harder  but it will be the true value of your youtube channels and make your channel real special     Best wishes  Jeff,2,0

Hi Patrick  of all the videos you ve posted to date that discuss Ukraine  this is definitely your most relevant   informative one  as it pertains to Bitcoin and crypto   and the most carefully worded one  as it pertains to Ukraine     Everything you said about Bitcoin and crypto sounds like it s coming from someone who s exceptionally smart  logical and reasonable  But based on what you say at the 6 46 mark  I think it s fair to question your credibility as it pertains to those same set of qualities    although you did follow it up with   In my personal and perhaps uninformed decision       Leaving Russia no choice but to defend themselves   is what I m referring to  Russia   really Putin   doesn t have a sound reason to  defend  itself from Ukraine  a sovereign country with no nuclear weapons  Are you completely unaware that Vladimir Putin is a totalitarian dictator with a history of extreme violence against anyone who opposes him  Do you actually believe that if Ukrainians were to just let Russia take full control of their country  Putin wouldn t enforce his will and harsh law just as he does within Russia s current borders  Do you not realize that if you spoke just as freely under Putin s rule as you can and do now as an American citizen  you would be imprisoned   if not assassinated   I just think you should consider re evaluating your take on the whole Ukraine crisis  it seems way too illogical  or uninformed as you mentioned  for such an otherwise brilliant mind ,6,2

The medical industrial complex receives around  6 5t in corporate welfare while the military industrial complex receives more than  800b  This is unconstitutional and must be impeached  Time for no confidence in these people  Everybody has to create the ecosystem they need and want while rejecting what they really don t need or want ,2,0

Like your videos but it is foolish to recommend a 17  liquidity pool for BTC   So if BTC x2 you will lose 25  of your BTC which will be changed into USDC to keep the liquidity pool equal   If BTC x 3  you will lose 33  of your bitcoin   Not a smart move ,16,10

 Fluffy Bunny 1st 2nd and 3rd generation coins  Own all 3 they are best of their breeds    50 30 20 BTC ETH ADA imho  If only considering those 3 coins and not others ,1,
I explained this more in https   defipro dev   but I think of liquidity as starting off with 50 50 of each asset  and then selling on the way up  or buying on the way down    If you believe Bitcoin is going to just moonshot up  then you would be better off holding just the single asset  and perhaps lending it on AAVE  ib  Yearn  etc for some interest    My personal view is that crypto is very volatile and will still move sideways with ups   downs  so liquidity is almost always a more optimal play as it may take months of volatile action   The other thing is  if you want to be more bullish you can hold two correlated assets like BTC ETH for instance  where you would still earn on the trading fees and have more of that market exposure if you want it ,12,
Does that work the same with losses   Asking for a friend,1,

WallStreet doesn t care for the bloodshed but people may  Think twice what your investments are so you don t have to be dripping blood while getting rich   And that s not about the war zone only by any means  There are places were kids and parents of newborn are getting killed everyday and nobody even notices  Seems like if there is no media coverage  it didn t happen  problem doesn t exist  Think where your money goes  where the product you support ends up  Peace and prosperity can coexist  It s truly up to you ,2,3
 I totally agree with what you are saying  There s no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull  but BTC is going nuclear  I started crypto in August 2017  and I bought in   I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85  during the ensuing 4 year bear market   I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do   I wish I had bought more  I have learned from youtubers and other expect traders  especially my mentor Max Witt  who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 23 to 54 btc  no one really knows what is going to happen and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past   It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research  ,5,7
Maybe the following is the solution  Ukraine should become a neutral country like Switzerland  Its neutrality would become part of its international appeal brand ,1,2
You bring some interesting perspectives and I understand your point  However  shouldn t Ukraine have the right to choose there own future  You suggest that they be more diplomatic but it seems clear Russia doesn t intend to allow Ukraine autonomy  So in your narrative how long do you play nice and bend to titranny  I don t see a diplomatic opportunity to get out from under Russia ,15,28

Russia s economy represents approximately 2  of the world s GDP  Why should we be concerned whether or not Russia ever rejoins SWIFT  Russians pouring money into BTC to preserve their money is futile at the moment since they re cut off from the world to be able to convert the BTC back into USD fiat circulation  They re stuck ,2,2
They are not cut off from Asia and Africa,2,

With the price of Bitcoin climbing again  it s not surprising that other cryptocurrencies are jumping too  As an investment vehicle and possible way around sanctions in Russia or elsewhere this could be very interesting  In times like this learning how to manage risk to minimize losses is vital  Yet  it s also necessary to master risk management in order to ensure maximum gains  After all  the more you re willing to risk  the greater the potential reward  I m not a pro trader but I was lucky enough to have made over 53  B T C from last month  following the instructions and signals from Cameron Chuang Crypto ,2,0

  I totally agree with what you are saying    The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 11 6 BTC in just three weeks  with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Dave Morrison    ,22,8
 Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list  in some months time you ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today  ,11,7

Nice content  well the price pump is amazing for very early investors or those who got in 7 days ago for the first time otherwise it s just bouncing back to normal price for the rest of us which is good btc truly is a class of its own  it has no competitors  All the other alts are competing with each other  they are more centralized  and the majority of them are not completed projects  I can t believe it when I hear people selling their btc for alts lol  that s why I trade with one of the best analysts since the last bear which I attain maximum success  With a capital of 6 I was able to make 17 btc from september till date after implementing trades with daily tips and info from Daryl Green a well renowned trader from Los Angeles  United States  I left his contacts in the comment below take care ,39,7

If Russia turn to crypto  nato countries will shut down   bring forward regulation of crypto exchanges to block  if exchanges shut down  liquidity is lost and price sinks   I m pro crypto but all of this constant push are early crypto investors trying to push their coins on retail  and where is retail btw  Where has the 2021 volume gone ,7,3

  As you can see we are already in march and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling  Tradlng went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 2 BTC when I started at 1 5 BTC  in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Luis Wyn would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about   You can reach Luis on  eI    m ProfLuis   ,5,6
