INVESTING IN CRYPTO NOW IS VERY COOL EXPECIALLY WITH THE CURRENT RISE IN THE MARKET  ACT NOW ,26,98
Great video Scott  The wisest thing that should be on everyone s mind currently should be to invest in different streams of income that doesn t depend on the govt  Especially with the current economic crisis around the world  This is still a good time to invest in BTC and digital currencies  BTC ETH        ,2,1
You made the fact  It doesn t matter  Who  What  Dislike and go on watching what gives you good feelings  Whuuha  speak like a roboter and add commercial content  Brainwash is not a source to upgrade your ego,1,1

Gotta make all the freedom haters cry lol    ,1,2
The market is very unstable and you can not tell If it s going bearish or bullish  I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses  When these reports are bullish take some off to the side lines  when news gets bearish start buying   Keep it simple simple  that bear  correction was the best thing that happened me But all thanks to Mark for his amazing skills for helping me  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 BTC when I started at 2 5 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from Mark Jean  I would advise you all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you aren t sure about You can reach Mark on  eI    m Markjean5050,8,6

 Fred Gallag Always backup your trading with a good strategy  else the bear market will hit you so hard  and you might wake up losing your savings ,2,
The long term investors like   Alexis Georgeanna Herman  do not worry about short term performance that s why i follow her trades  which made me get a profit of  17 300 from  2 740  Whilst there will be crashes and opportunities to buy the overall trend is a positive one ,3,
If you have the patience and discipline to buy and hold any asset or stock  you will be rewarded ,4,
I was banned from Twitter over a year ago  My account was always in suspended animation  So now I don t care what they do with it  I ve found more productive ways to waste time  Like here for example ,2,2
DISLIKE,1,2
A great conversation about the whole Musk Twitter thing  https   youtu be y49xMXKN9 4,1,1
Hmm  by no means  it is verified that  it will happen   but from one of the tweets after Elon made the purchase was to Opensource the algorithm  Which I assume  is the algorithm behind how information are circulated for users to manipulate how they perceive their information    Personally  from my point of view  paying 44 Billion to show ads on the platform is fine unless it diverges the whole point of this massive purchase and effects the opinions of the people   If Elon  does what he says  this is gonna be revolutionary  If this isn t done at some point in time  the future is gonna be dark     We are just a part of hivemind created by tech giants   What does this mean  we are being constantly manipulated with the information we perceive on the internet from the corps like GOOGLE  FACEBOOK oops   META  you name it ,2,2

Netflix also suffered because as the world opened people left the media streaming services after lockdown and started going out again  After a couple of years of been stuck in you home watching movies all day it got tiring  after the lockdown Netflix had nothing else to give  Also  a lot of there new movies are so woke that I deleted my account about 2 years ago  ,16,4
Even Anne with an E had a woke streak in it  very annoying ,1,
Developing from the Commons a superbe free speech and open source information platform with training facilities on how to operate gates to free abundantly available naturally sustained energy and information resources would be logical when you look at what Musk has comprehensively been collecting over the years ,2,1
My question to Techlead is what happened to your Million Token  You don t seem to promote it as much anymore ,1,1
Only GOD THE GENERATOR   CREATOR AND DO NOT FORGET THE DESTROYER    WILL CONTROL WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE THE POLARITY OF GOOD AND EVIL BELONGS TO HIM       ,1,1

Techlead I found your prediction in CoinRiders  of bitcoin go to 100k in 2022  Is it still relevant ,1,1
It means I can get my account back after being banned for saying let s go Brandon ,4,2
Finally a little common sense on this subject   I am in agreement  lots of possibilities here but people build Musk up to be something he is not  If you re a rational person  there is just no evidence that he has done anything nefarious  In agreement on Netflix as well  But I will add my belief  that the decline in Netflix and the appearant public desire for Musk to buy Twitter are connected  Nobody seems interested in supporting entertainment or professional sports after the woke movement  A take away might be  people don t like being told hiw to act by individuals they put in the position of  celebrity    Either 81 million people are having buyers remorse or that figure was hugely manipulated   ,2,1

elon musk bought twitter to shadowban bill gates,1,1
If I were Elon  I would make twitter more then tweets  He doesn t need to buy FB if he adds features to twitter that make it more like FB or instagram  The network is already there  he just needs to figure out a set of rules for everyone to abide by ,13,2
Love your Channel    Greatings from Norway  ,2,2
Your intro is flawed  You think he s doing it to be the cool kid  Elon is a Patriot  When platform s are restricting free speech that s a major issue  Just because people don t like what Trump has to say  he should be offered the same platforms as his opponents ,1,2
I think Elon wants Twitter to be the centre of the meta verse  also  Will ultimately link in to neuralink as well ,11,3
What s that wallpaper ,1,1
i think its ludicrous that anyone would buy twitter for that much  suddenly lost A LOT of respect for musk  complete waste of money  He could have started his own for 100k us and then just tried to make it popular  what a bizarre thing to do  he should have just given everyone on earth 1000 pound each lol ,1,4

it s going to be interesting to see if people like Trump are allowed back on Twitter  I am not sure what responsibilities Twitter will have if people start instigating riots through Twitter but will will find out soon  Similarly  you can t yell  fire  in a crowded theater just for fun so the same logic may apply to social media yet difficult to enforce ,1,3

so all the money   and he overlooked all the poor people who could use the help  he instead bought twitter ,1,2

I thought it was a big deal and I got excited for a moment  but then I realized I ve never had a Twitter account ,25,3
Incidents like this are not really about changing our personal lives  It s more about changing the direction of society in general which affects us all on a deep level whether we want it to or not ,1,2
Deactivated my account on twitter after these news  Not that i m a big dude there or anything  But Elon Musks version of free speech is not going to benefit the whole world ,1,2
Yes       ,1,2

  I would rather Elon control twitter than a bunch of board directors taking order fm the politicians who spin it to their gains and climate excuses  And btw did you not know that trees is also the causes of Co2 depending of how hot the sun shines on them   everything has a balance in the universe  I wonder what will happens if the oxygen level replaces Co2 formulations  boom  We will all be on fire  ,1,2
Elon has a long plan in place  I think crypto will be a big part of future social media   Maybe even a star kink connection,1,2

I always wonder how I always end up watching his Tab switching  comment reciting videos  he is phenomenal ,9,2
It remains to be seen ,1,2
 authenticating all humans  that sounds a lot like anonymity  not censorship  will be the first thing to go ,3,3
Yeah  something like my first thought on anonymity  Privacy is as important as free speech  Perhaps Twitter   I mean    Elon    would only verify whether a human executes commands only in order to kill off  automated flash mob   which is highly desirable  PCness and self censorship   oh  same thing haha   is truly deplorable  I find that more offensive than socio political restriction ,3,
I think because he knows AI so well  he probably understands the extent to which social media platforms are manipulated by fake accounts  bots  and algorithmic manipulation ,2,
I hope this guy gets fired right away  savage,1,2

Hey Techlead  any tips on how I can become a millionaire by creating shitty pro Russian videos on my channel ,1,2
Back in cali   Old setup,1,2
Lol twitter is the only thing i use  I know its hard to grasp for people who don t use it  Try and join community that you believe in  you twitter experience will never be the same ,1,3
Maybe Elon will hire you and you could be an x Twitter tech lead lol,1,2
Good for him buying twitter but I don t think society is going to improve because he owns it   Not because of him but because people are selfish and lack direction   They love to go on twitter to get distracted because its more painful to look at their own lives ,1,2
The masses will follow and invest  If twitter improves my dating life  I will bow to the king ,1,2
I d like to see you on twitter more TL,1,2
0 00 when you drank so much coffee  v,2,3
His move to purchase Twitter maybe one of the factors that might save America  To it her has been a left wing mouthpiece for a couple of years now and opening it up to you points that opposed the left is one of the greatest benefits to mankind  Twitter has influenced the last election heavily  Because it is unbalanced and favors leftist opinions ,1,2
If I dated I guarantee she d leave  we d be seated at a nice restaurant  after I spent the first 1 hour talking about Elon  she d check out after I started going over the Boring Company details  Sucks for her  this is real life ,7,2

Tesla I would say is totally an ecosystem  Tesla car  charged via their solar panels  or charged on their network  or charged by the powerwall  Then the batteries being used for storage for renewable technologies  Then you talk about the smaller companies which granted arent much but the whole robot thing they got going  neuralink  SpaceX  and Boring company pretty ecosystem oriented,2,5
What does it mean  Does it even mean anything    ,1,2
You forget to add as millionaire,1,2
he gonna be able to form public opinion on any subject  also if he make twitter open source  it does not mean what he gonna be using same version of twitter in his servers  maybe hes short of ideas  will make it open source and then gonna take best parts of its forks,1,2

This matters a lot to me  For all I know  Elon Musk is just a bunch of pixels  Maybe you are only pixels  Are either of you real  Only on screen  Do you impact my life  Both of you do  You have made me think  You have given good advice  You have also made me think twice  You have positively impacted my life whether a real person or not  Elon Musk is important because I want the future to still have options when my daughter is an adult  I actually invision in my mind a frightening  inevitable tech revolution of society  But  I would rather it be one with options and choice whether virtual and secluded or not  That s my two cents  I don t necessarily care about him on a personal level  Though  the idea of him as a motivated  successful  routine  logical  non emotional man is extremely attractive  He does like creating babies a bit too much  and that is not attractive  So  he is not real but an idea   No one is real unless I see them in person  Isn t that just a fact  Life is only created in reality by what our mind can render in front of us  Mythic Mode raiding was only real for those who could participate  Otherwise  it was not reality to those players  That never rendered in their MMORPG world   I m getting off track  I m slightly frustrated atm  I had to wake myself up from a pretty much a comatose state and it feels very  very not good  I had to get to a concert for my daughter for school  Now I m  awake    It s not always this bad  I m commenting as if I m talking to someone  Lol  Dear Diary  blah blah blah  I would go back and erase stuff  Brain on standby ,5,10

No offense but i think as an ex google  ex facebook drone  you are completely missing the point here  I guarantee Elon does not see this as a marketing tool or a place to push his agenda  That s how Google and Facebook think  That s not how Musk thinks  My Money is on him buying twitter to connect it with starlink and establish a global freespeech platform that brings humanity together and ultimately solves the specter of war  One can only really justify war against people that one doesn t know  If everybody has friends in every country  no more war  And since each of Elons companies tackle one existential threat to humanity  i think this makes sense  Might also at some point be used as a direct democracy platform ,1,2

 Sarbjot Singh You are wrong  Elon can easily use Twitter to market products from his other businesses  without scaring off other viechle companies   In fact  if a brand as prominent as Tesla starts using twitter as a primary promotional outlet  more similar companies will be attracted to Twitter because of the increase of potential customers   Elon can do mostly what he wants with Tesla to promote their products because he is by far the driving force of the organisation  and its most valuable asset   Twitter is struggling to make enough money considering their widespread brand recognition   Elon will be given free rein to generate more money for Twitter  no one else in the world has proven anywhere near to Elon in being a wealth generator based on personality  and business outlook   Twitter at present is stagnant  and without inspiration   Elon will change this  enabling it to satisfy ordinary users  whilst becoming attractive to businesses ,2,
 Sarbjot Singh I did not hear TL say Twitter will exclusively advertise for Tesla ,1,
 Twitter is not living up to its potential as a platform for  FreeSpeech   I m cautiously optimistic that Elon will make Twitter better than it has been for years       Democracy is Not possible without  FreeSpeech aka  Truthful  Journalism      CENSORSHIP is the Tool used when the LIE loses its power      Control the narrative  control the world      The greatest weapon is not a gun  nor is it nuclear    it s information control     Corporate owned MSM will Rot your zucking brain        People tend to overestimate the power of the US war machine  and underestimate the power of its propaganda machine     Social Media like Twitter   Facebook are the modern  Public Square    CENSORSHIP violates the Constitution s 1st Amendment on  FreeSpeech  These treasonous  Anti Democratic acts against  WeThePeople Must NOT be tolerated      The power of lies propaganda must never be underestimated      First  they took the journalists      we don t know what happened after that     Those who can make you believe absurdities  can make you commit atrocities   Voltaire     Propaganda is much less effective    when you Know it s propaganda,2,1

It s a social experiment  A flex  in the biggest way  And personally I agree with the privatisation of everything that involves what drives the world  what connects people as a whole and matters towards the future of humanity  So  as much as I think social media is detrimental to interpersonal communication  I still think Tesla owning Twitter should be an indicator to the future of finance  and the world  generally  as we know if ,8,1

I totally agree with what you are saying     The fact is  BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest  before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first  for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish  while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose  others are being patient  it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals  i would say trading has been going smoothly for me  i started with 2 5 BTC and i have accumulated over 12 6 BTC in just few months with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Josh Jhang  ,5,4
