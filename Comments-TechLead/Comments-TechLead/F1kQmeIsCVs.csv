I would truly thank you in person and offer you friendship if we ever meet  for these videos  You re one of a kind dude that is not afraid of showing the world who you are  I learn something new whenever I listen to you  and I would consider myself  relatively  experienced in life  Especially  money less life    I would give you one advice  Try finding a friend without him knowing your net worth  Present yourself as a penniless bum  not  that  literally  and see if you can meet someone who will value you as a person  as  who you are   not  what you are   You are bound to meet at least 1 worthy person in this world  Cheers ,1,

Last few years i put some money in crypto to make more money  I made huge gains but i never cashed out  Then everything was collapsing  And now i luckily didnt really lose much  i m kind of even with what i ve put in  And i know  right now financially is probably the worst time to sell some bitcoin  But i m going to do it  and with the money i m gonna travel for 2 months  And those two months will be an unforgettable experience that give my life so much more joy and happiness  And i realised you don t need that much money to get those experiences  I m not the luxury type anyway   I can travel through south america for about 1 800 euro s a month and have the time of my life ,1,1

What you haven t considered here is chronic illness  No one who is chronically ill desires dependency or wants to require subsidized aid  however  though it shames us  many do not have a choice  I graduated high school as a straight A student  with a profound desire to help others  I went for a service degree in psychology  however due to genetically inherited mental illness  a lifetime of physical and sexual abuse  in my second year of college I had a mental breakdown  Because the only was I could receive treatment was to apply for SSI I did so  Poor treatment led to a 6 year period of dissociation  It was after 2 years of therapy starting at age 26 I was able to leave my abusers  After 4 more years of therapy I was able to go out in public  talk to people  develop a relationship and believed I could go back to college  So I did so  In 4 months I had another breakdown and was forcibly hospitalized  To look at me you would never know  To talk to me you would never know  My doctors all agree that I should stop  stop trying to get a career  stop going for a formal education  But what money means is freedom from the forced poverty of SSI  it means not living in fear of losing my only access to medical treatment  It means seeking self betterment without the restrictions of government limitations  It means having a chance  Poverty is rarely a choice  sickness never is  to live in both is unbearable,1,0
I believe   that the inflation is already priced in crypto market since the end of last year  These manipulative rats are always 2 steps ahead of everybody because they are market makers  I hope I m wrong and they won t keep dumping it on retail investors as always  Those who hold the longest will profit the most  I trade and hold profits keep up the great work  and also Alexander Thomas has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio from 1 74BTC to 8 9 BTC lately,5,5

I love TechLead s content but I have to say I don t think a lot of this makes sense  obviously being a travel guide won t provide you the time and money to have the kind of vacations a retired millionaire would have  People do need money  which translates to worry free time  and not everyone wants a business  There s some other useful points here but it seems TechLead has a business perspective about life ,1,1

Alrighty then  I have finally found someone who s frame of mind is unique  and that s a shame   Your perspective is somewhat enlightening and depressing at the same time when you think of the many other types of people that borrow to invest and save to only pass it on to sometimes loved ones and sometimes not so loved ones  In either case  I thank you for this very eye opening and real truth of our false goals for happiness   Time is definitely the asset that we need to focus on  invest in  and cherish for what it means   God bless,1,0

Some golden nuggets of wisdom in this video  Hope you stay on YouTube to explore this topic further   I became antiquated with a young man on FB a few years ago  He is from an impoverished area in Pakistan  most of the country   He personally knew of 7 women who had lost their husbands to Covid   He had an idea   to provide them each with a sewing machine so they could do piece work and make some money to cover some basic living expenses for their families  He sent me a list of their names with pictures and told me where he would purchase the machines and how much they would cost  about 50 00 US each  I partnered with a friend and we sent the money in two payments  After he had sent pictures of the first two women with their machines along with pictures of the receipts we sent the money for the rest   I found this to be a very rewarding experience  It also makes the shinny material objects of this world look a little duller to me  We are know working on purchasing and installing a hand water pump for a family that has to walk two kilometers every day to get water  Thank you for letting me share about this and thank you for your insights  Looking forward to your next video ,1,1
Hahaha I relate a lot to this  For the last 2 years I ve felt like if making money  or working  is meaningless  What I ve come to realize is that money is a good way for you to measure  how well  you are doing  The key here is to do something you d do if money wasn t a thing   Hard to find out by the way ,26,5
 Money is a good way to measure how well you re doing         This is 1000000000  wrong way of thinking  Not even close to true   IMO you should strongly rethink your metrics ,2,
I love it how he talks about not knowing what to do with his money    The thing that makes you truely happy is socialisiation  Experiancing emotion and sharing experiences   Find someone you truely care about  you share hobbies with and spend money not on goods but on things you do togather   That will make you happy   I love it how he himself  devorced  friendless and with no child  cannot find an answer to his own question   Get a hobby  find like minded people who share the hobby  Thats the first part of socialisiation   A rich medical doctor will be far more content with his life than a techlead with no human interaction    because he had so much human interaction and increaced the value of life for others    So again spend your money on socializing activities and if you are not able to do that from a psychological stand point  go see a mental doctor  to sort out your psychological trauma  He is at a point where money does not make him happy anymore ,1,

He s so close  Money has way less value than your abilities and strengths  What are you using those for  To make money  To make the world a better place  To make your home a better home  Your community better  We are so caught up on Money that we forgot to live our lives in a way that benefited everyone around us ,1,0

As a person just getting into youtube with the goal of owning my own property and home while learning and sharing gardening and growing self sufficiency  i feel what you are saying  Finding others that have actual goals and at the same time are interesting enough to be worth time os difficult  I am splitting time trying to make money for my interests doing DD and GH deliveries and learning to work with YT and editing ect  so mini investors which is what i consider the folks who watch us are  Ultimately I am working towards owning my own and building it to share and learn  Anyway  thank you for reaffirming my belief that time is money and while this may be the hard way  I think I am on the right path ,6,2

Hi  I really liked your videos until the last two  Feels like you burned out from this world   I can t even imagine how hard your life can be  Not having friends to connect with  Did you tried mentoring others or your goal is to have fun and travel  You talk real life problems so easily  I know in 20 years I ll have a life what I want but not everybody is a genious so it s weird ,1,0
Your example with the friend who takes advantage of you only works if you keep abusers around as your  friend   The reality is that lending out money to people puts a risk on your relationship if they re unable to pay you back  That s why it s better to assume you re giving the money away or don t gift it at all ,1,0
For those who still don t get it  the hard truth  1 51 focus on money is toxic and terribly boring  6 21 bitcoin is totally useless in today s society  4 23 you don t really want a lamborghini because the car owns you rather than you own the lambo  And some good advices  10 16 what people really need is a business idea  a self funded lifestyle that lets you do what you like doing because it creates value  11 06 don t invest on markets like you are a shell company  invest on yourself  treat you like you are the startup ,2,0

When I was young  I remember being told that  time is money   Which made me realise that must also mean  money is time   That is  the two are interchangeable  So  instead of using money to buy things  I used it to buy time  In other words  I retired when I was 42  giving me time to focus on my hobbies and just enjoying life in general  I think it is money well spent ,110,16

If you read this  The first rule of money is to never tell people you have money  You seem to have this problem where you hide behind as a status symbol for validation  this is why your relationships have all been shallow and materialistic   This is what is attracts    You also have a snarky  patronising personality that repels people   Success is a relative term  there are people living great lives with very little financial success who I see as  successful  this seems to be the epiphany you have reached    I m only saying this to help you  as I found some of your videos very helpful and could see the underlying motive was in good nature  Ironically nothing to do with your money  this is how genuine relationships and respect are formed btw ,1,1

Patrick  you should make Technological Art  What if you could create art with your wealth and digital knowledge  These artifacts small or large can be interactive  physicalised embodiments of your technical  financial knowledge  These artifacts could be placed in great Galleries of the world or be purchased through auction by people and placed in their homes   Technological art blending advanced metallurgy  electronics  beauty  light  sound  A I  holograms  and prehaps mind bending codes puzzles   I think that when people have overcome the struggles or problems of growing up  getting an education  money issues  working jobs etc and their time is freed up  I believe the deeper aspects of life have a place to emerge  leading to spiritual and creative  revival of the art of life  which at its higher form of expression  is prehaps the creation and interaction of advanced technology that interfaces with consciousness and the Universe,1,0

Techlead is so right about the car,1,0
Always a great video mr  techlead  I hope you find yourself well and content  Thank you for helping us realize what really matters through it all  Hmm I m no billionaire but il take the time billionaire  I personally think the best investment is the investment in ourselves as a person  or on a bigger scale  the evolution of our soul as time passes by  Which is possibly hardest to acquire most over looked asset we have in this world  The universe we live in has an interesting mechanic where those who choose to invest in their hearts  and give unto themselves  over everything else with the notion of evolution in mind  bettering oneself   secrets of the world we live in start to unravel in how it operates in the form of chance or randomness phenomena as we take the ascent into our multidimensional aspects of our soul  We know that the soul isn t anything physical at all  All it takes is the surrendering to the problems given by the universe  and in a way  applying reverse psychology and receiving the wisdom on why the problem at hand has manifest  always linking back to a corrupt aspect of our psyche   as within so without   striving to have that focus on bettering our mental state and emotional body every waking day  As one rises in personal overall human frequency the reality we wake up to everyday begins to morph and change and rid all the old cyclic problems we were stuck to and presents new forms of problems that are our initiations to our next state of our personal enlightenment and souls happiness  The government in power knows this knowledge about our soul and does everything to dumb us down so they can squeeze our soul liquid and keep us enslaved into our ego using our energy to manifest more money and power for them  To be disturbed distorted our whole life  When we are really trying to shed the ego for each and every single last one of us here on the planet on a bigger scale away from the physical world  So we stay in one low mental state of perception all life long  and instead of ascending the frequency over time  it is taking a descent and becoming more demonic overtime  I love the wisdom questions  Keep them coming mr techlead    You are vastly appreciated  Happy to give my small two cents on the matter  I am much like you and prefer to live a lifestyle alone as others come with karma or personality traits that are distorted due to their failure of being honest with themselves and grow as a overall person ,5,1

Totally agree with you   Asset wise  I may be a millionaire  2 rental properties  total 12 apartments  worth C 3M  with  1M mortgage   My new goal is to help 1 person family to be financially independent  each year  who will be wealthy  self sufficient  enough so that in his her lifetime  as pay it forward  will be able to help 1  or 2  person s  family to help to get out of poverty  And the cycle continue  This year  I am helping a Ukrainian family  a very old friend  to resettle in Canada  Money itself will not give you happiness  what will bring happiness is  how you use your money to help others to be happy ,2,1

I know exactly how much money I need and exactly what I will do with it  It will make me free to live the life I want  nothing fancy  But just enough to allow me to put all my time into fun experiences and people things I love rather than working until I m 60  That s how it should be  but people are just too greedy ,1,0

Please don t quit doing your youtube channel  I m a new sub  and every time I listen to you   I learn  What you say is very valuable  I appreciate your perspective  and absorb every thing you say  My hope is that you continue to bless us w your knowledge wisdom  Not everyone has someone like you to learn from    I m glad I ve had the opportunity  THANK YOU ,14,2
Your knowledge is great is advice  Some people have opportunities and some do not  I personally work 40hrs a week and take additional overtime if available yet always find myself myself behind due to poor choices from my family growing up not explaining the proper use of money  If youtube was around when I had opportunity to make my choices before I had a family of my own things would have been different  Availability now is to grow with knowledge before the money is an issue as I explain to my children that youtube isn t a useless tool yet a door way for opportunities to endless choices   Yet you offer anyone money in your statements but yet determine that is is not what one needs  Easy to say for one that has these options but others that work hard and disciplined to watch their direction to be positive in this life  Money is a way out of stress for paying utilities rent  essentially all the daily supplies to maintain the basics for a family  One thing money will never replace is knowledge and love for family  I would rather be poor and have my family in my arms everyday with high hopes for better days then wealthy and look for things to do to waste time spending money being apart from family  It is a win lose problem that will continue till the end of our days and for evermore  Till the day we all rest as say wow we could have done it differently but will be to late   Be well and wise with your choices and the water Tiger show you the path of least resistance in your direction ,1,0

I was thinking about you said in the video  How much do I need to get off my feet  I need like 3000 USD and i could literally start over and get ahead  This life is miserable atm  Everytime I make a small amount of money it s gone instantly  which indirectly makes it so I cant catch up  I eat for 40 USD per week now  I have literally just enough to get by with rent and food  been living like this for over a year  Time to change  Imma wake up early tommorow  gotta do smth else ,1,1

This guy has been rich to long  I don t do all my investing for me I do it for my kids grandkids  To give them a head start at a better life  Maybe they do right by it maybe they don t but at least I gave them a better chance than they would have had without it and some financial literacy to boot  I ve been down and I ve been up  and I tell ya up is WAAAY better ,2,2
im of a similar mindset as you brother  i view the money that i have invested as my future childrens money  i simply view myself as a custodian of it for the time being ,1,
so many people just want enough money not to feel like they re drowning or behind  the issue with that is if you don t have a specific goal  you ll never attain that dream  it ll never be enough  self awareness has to be key  great video,4,1
it s also that if you have a lot of money  you can use a little money for non necessary things  If you don t have a lot of money  you should be less spendy  It s as simple as being able to go on vacation when you want  where you want  Buy a ps5 when it came out  without having to save or compromise  It s not about the big things  Other than getting a nice car and house  it s about being able to spend smaller amounts often  Not living paycheck to paycheck ,1,1

This smells of classic midlife crises    Part of the issue here is that money is not the goal  bjt a means to an end  Why are the ends most ppl strive for  Consumption  Paying taxes  living in a nice house in a hood school district  eating good food  building great relationships and memories with your friends and family all take money    As you say  capital allocators  are making money to leave a legacy  The modern equipment of building a great building  Exiting your life having made something to be proud of ,1,0
There s no way that TechLead will quit YT ,2,0
Please don t stop making videos  ,2,2
thanks you   ,1,0
Dont leave  man,1,1
Actually I think you should not stop making videos as there are many different topics that you included in your films in a completely different view that all other reviews  And the way you look   different aspects you include  make your videos very interesting and valuable  Moreover you use the logic  not emotions in your analysis and that makes is at least twice as valuable for me as I am INTP and believe me   there aren t many valuable resources for INTP people  So you closing your channel would be a great loss   ,1,1

Well i pursue money to buy homes and travel  At the end of the day money saves time  Can travel with ease  enjoy beautiful parts of the country without having to worry about how much the trip is or how much cost of goods will be  But if you aren t allocating any of the money you are passively making  than i get what your saying  But it seems like you are projecting your own views since you live such a boring life,1,1
Yes this is another good video,1,1
I thought I came here for a savant TechLead but I realised I m enjoying the Life Coaching more   What I get from your piece is its about realising what is real value to us  not what we think it is or brought up to think it is  You re right  of course  time  health  and happiness are far more valuable than any amount of money  We think money will give us these things  But the truth is we don t need money to have good health and therefore more time or be happy  Thank you for this ,20,1

Are you guys dull    He is talking about himself  That s how he met his wife basically  She just a friend  or acquaintance he would probably say  next thing he knew he was getting cuffed for a domestic violence order  Yeah  If what that true from his videos that s what he is talking about  And for the brains on this guy all this shows is anyone  ANYYYONE CAN GET PLAYED BY A FEMALE anyone  Tech lead said he is paying  5000 in child support  My guy  women are treacherous  She got him  Smfh ,3,

What he is discribing is not a friend  but a gold digger  Don t spend your money on status symbols for others  that s just dumb  The answer he cannot give  because he hasn t found it yet is socialization   Having a group of people you share values and principles of life with  share hobbies with and spending money on hobbies and experiencing great things as a group will give you far more satisfaction than seeing a now rise on your screen ,7,

Money means I won t have to spend my precious time working a shitty job I dont like  Money brings status which attracts beautiful women which means I can now attract beautiful women   Money means freedom meaning that I wouldn t have to stay in a city I don t like a stick with people I hate  I could travel to anywhere I d wish to go and meet great people there   So yeah I need money ,2,1

By your definition I am a time billionaire by a hairs length  I went back to school as a single parent in my late 40s  because the time spent working at a steel mill has ended in a loss of pension  Therefore   when I m as you stated  wasting my investment on elder care  I can live the best end of my life as I am physically able  be it caring for grandchildren or watching tv as opposed to starving to death  walk a mile ,11,2

Time billionaire thing hit me hard  Thank you tech lead for giving this insight  I  agree what you said  but you are saying this because you seem to have given up on all your family responsibilities or have completed all of  them   Thing is  societal or family responsibility may be stopping a person from doing what they really want  If we do exactly what you say  then also our mind will not be satisfied  we will think despite being a time billionaire you couldn t even help your family to achieve some degree of happiness  And when we become real money millionaire we would have  lost our time youth  childhood  carelessness and would have become time broke ,40,2

We re also watching your channel in Eastern Europe  if you re giving away money  put it to a greater purpose like children  med research  refugees  the most valuable thing you can buy with money is the time with the loved ones  that makes you rich if you can afford to spent time with your children as they grow up or your grandparents as long as they are here with us  I like your channel  keep it going     ,7,1
