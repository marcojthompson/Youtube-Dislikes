 Jay Quite the opposite    you end up wanting to gamble less after you lose enough lol    better odds with crypto and nfts that have solid fundamentals imho,1,
Very good video   I completely agree with these sentiments   It s good to see some people with money out there like you who are making a conscious effort to spend it wisely and valuing the opportunity of having such freedom  Also  I have to say  consider giving some back to people or animals in the ways you find most valuable    I also live in Las Vegas and it s a pretty decent place to live  especially if you can travel regularly  Wishing much to love to you man  and it s good to see someone in your position not just going after material goods or social media accolades ,2,

I follow your channel I have a question  you mention you want to do travel   Wouldn t that be also overrated    Like why go somewhere be a turist and view things but you are not really sharing these experiences with anyone but yourself   Do you ever stay up at night thinking about the past and think about past experiences or travel you did in the past   I think at most might be like 10 minutes but other than that we tend to live in the present   You can do a virtual reality travel and get the same experience just to view random places  cities   you are not really sharing anything with anyone and you are just spending money to travel to another country to do turist things   It seem boring too ,2,

I enjoy createing a space worth living in  in fact its a very important part of my life  A place to call home  There is absolutly nothing wrong with creating a space of beauty  or making it a home    If you do not have taste  appreciation of asethetics  appreciation of human ingenuity  or the craftmanship of timber or any capacity to create a space that relfects the depth and breadth of your soul  passions  tastes and interests  that is between you and yourself   You will feel differently about your lust for  experiences  in 4 years or less  When you realise the human need to have a secure base  to know as home is absolute priority     Experiences  are not the signal of a  good life   Just pointless hedonstic foolishness   I know many people with a lot of  experiences  and they moved through each  snapping selfies like midges skipping over the surface of a waters lake  There was no depth  no appreciation  They were simply seeking to  tick  it off their bucket list and later brag about it to others via social media platforms  Meaningful   These are people running from themselves  Rather  then having the courage to face their existential void  and in your case bucket loads of unresolved anger  they believe  experiences  are the answer  Travel  holidays pleasure  they are not      Where ever you go  there you are   A person could argue are wasting time being an exceedingly joyless individual and you are here on social media  Youtubing  YOUR life away   while judging others and all around demonstrating a brooding misanthropy  Perhaps  you have a  mattress in middle of empty room  as it relfects something about yourself   I flat out disagree with you and reject the contempt you are throwing out at the world ,1,1

Being single and alone may be appealing for  a while  but a life without family  a wife and children  will be a life of regret at some point in the future  You will die alone without anyone who truly loves you  No amount of money  fine dining  travel or worldly success can compensate for a loving family relationship  Of course  it s not easy  but it s worth it ,1,1

What many out there in entrepreneurship don t understand  Being a millionaire is not primarily about showing the world how great you are  It s about the hard way to get there  The many mistakes and getting up again  the experiences  the memories  the positive as well as negative emotions  the sweat  the people who helped you along the way  etc     There are people who are into that kind of thing  And if you have found your own  Genius Zone   you have a unique opportunity to experience yourself in a new way in our modern times    In entrepreneurship  the journey is the goal ,6,1

Well said  I ve been around for decades and I have seen my share of stock market contractions  Saw the birth of video gaming  and the birth of the internet  to name a few  Now  I get to witness the birth of blockchain and Crypto  and I can personally attest that Crypto is a completely different beast from the US stock market  100  agree that there should be a guarded approach to crypto investing  You may not win hearts and minds of everyone  but you have and are earning respect for telling the truth and trying to help others to look out for themselves  I m super picky who I listen too for crypto analysis   I have made over 8 5 btc from day tradng with Pro trader Jordan Meyers Signals in few weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish For crypto related issues  You can reach Jordan on  eI    m Jordmeyers ,44,9

So I stumbled over your videos on YouTube last night wanting to learn about defi etc  however I am learning more than this as your insights provide perspective  hope and very good advice on the essential and necessities of life vs consumerism and materialism that is plainly a waste of time  money and energy   Very inspired by you to hear more of what you have to share   Cheers,1,0

This is pretty interesting tho  Wonder what happens to this plan when there s a certain set of pheromones that finally challenge your entire perspective on life  As in someone else that has the same exact perspective  Life is interesting  the more you execute your nomadic life  the greater exposure to various personalities and so on you will come across  Question is  will you be able to challenge yourself to actually try engaging or will you run away in fear       ,1,1
Traders should avoid attempting to predict trend reversals  or even worse  I believe there is more to this market than we currently understand  When people are losing  they don t endeavor to increase their average  Using expert Randy Philip s assistance  I ve made almost 19 5 btc on a 4 btc Trade capital over the last 8 months  Things could get worse  so make the wise decision  Markets fluctuate in cycles that might span anywhere from a few days to several years  In the case of B  TC  it s difficult to make a bullish case merely by glancing at the chart  It s a lot more complicated than some people want you to believe   dothefivedothefive You can reach Randy on  eI    m  Randy philip,1,1

As a millionaire    you could buy the Oceanside property and rent the lower floors and it would be a solid investment    as a millionaire    The irony that you describe yourself in your videos  by being that which you criticize  You re a salesman trying to make money by saying you re better than the  losers  watching your videos  I respect the sale and the product  but you and others have to also respect the irony that you are in fact that which you criticize ,1,2
I also agree with the advice that over analyzing long term investments is a big waste of time   and mentally and emotionally taxing,1,

My kid had her mattress directly on the floor and I discovered a significant amount of mold formed on the underside   I threw out the mattress and got a new one along with a basic bedframe to allow for proper airflow    Since you ll be using a humidifier  I recommend you make sure you raise your bed up off the floor for better airflow   Good luck out there in the desert ,5,1

Damn bro that really hit me deep down  Since I graduated from high school I didn t wanna go to college  but my parents forced me to study medicine and I hated my life  Because I don t imagine myself as a doctor I don t wanna waste my entire life living another people dream  And I started investing so I can make enough money to live a free life to be able to do what I want to do the things I want and whenever I want  So I hope that I can achieve my goal and live a free life  BTW please never stop making these videos,68,10

Thanks for this video  one of your best    2 weeks ago I stumbled across your channel for the first time and yes I was thinking  this guy is stupid    Don t worry   half way through the content I was laughing out loud from your dry witty humour and realized that no  I was the stupid one  this guy is a genius   Since then I ve seen hours of your videos and have found some pure gold   Thank you for the inspiration and I look forward to the day I ll shake your hand and call you friend ,2,1
There s something downright nihilistic about the way you talk about life  Perhaps your wondering why after being so successful your still struggling to enjoy it   I think  there isn t just one way to enjoy your life  Some would say that not working after you ve made enough money to live your life out on the beach is simply not fulfilling  I think we all earn for something bigger than the things we can find on earth  And everything we use as  purpose  here will ultimately fail us  I think the only way to find true purpose and meaning is to live for God and be a part of his purpose  It might sound crazy to the demographic of this channel but I m just like you  I m a incoming software engineer at Microsoft and I believe that science and faith complement each other not contradict,1,0
Dear Tech lead  Never stop making videos ,17,1
Chapter 1   Happiest memories for me always involved traveling   hiking in some cold ungodly lonely place  be it the top of the Norwegian Fiords or at the outskirts of an old Roman outpost near a small village against the Black Sea in Bulgaria etc    Oddly getting to these lonely places involve traveling through not so lonely places   In the not so lonely places one keeps bumping in to the same travelers going the same direction and sometimes a romance would bloom   Those romances are also some of the happiest memories mainly because that is where I found my wife   Chapter 2   The wife always wants the materialistic knick knacks like bedframes  but purrs and is happy with a complete nest so I make the bedframe in my shop   She is happy because her nest is simply the best nest  I am happy because I make it instead of buying some piece of crapola   Chapter 3   With all the money printing I simply at a loss why you don t buy a vacation rental that you can rent out and also live in   The small perk being your tax deductible inflation hedge that generates income happens to also be the free place to throw your frameless mattress in BUT the big perk is you get to install a whole house 7 stage reverse osmotic water membrane filter in your plumbing system  It brings Las Vegas hard water dissolved undesirables from over a thousand parts per million down to seven  I own one and have measured the results   It works that good   Then you run the drinking water through a second refrigerated copper mineral bath that only reintroduces the optimal stuff and brings the PH up to 9 5   You simply can t do that in a rental  Finally growing up in San Francisco and having a lot of roommates  that owned no bedframes  there is a lot to be said about good Fung Shway in the home  the restaurants one buys their food from  in their city etc       Sadly that s probably why I finally had to leave San Fran   Sorry to report  bedframes do make even the loneliest traveler happier ,1,0

I love his dark humour and have to agree with a lot of what he s saying  We all think we ll live until we re 90 and the reality is that s probably not going to happen  Do what makes you happy and stop worrying about what others think  We get one life so live it how you want to  I think it s sad how people devote there whole lives to work  unless you truly do love what you do ,2,0

Techlead  to be honest  your hatred towards materialism and consumerism is based on the fact that you have alr obtained financial freedom  whereas a lot of other people in the world are struggling to get their next meal  so they have no time to care about these controversies you said   Also  talking about elon musk  for these kind of upper class people  they are not just pursuing money if that is all you meant  their company are money driven for sure  but they are also thinking a bigger picture     common goods of human being  whereas your value system focus on cherish youself and your time as an individual viewpoint  Both value systems I believe can bring happiness  the only point I disagree with you in the point about being stuoid  there is no stupid  there is just difference in how we perceive the world   Anyway  respect to your generous sharing of your value systems,4,1
Man            You on to something GREAT and i feel you 100   I been on that level since i put all my belongings in a storage and live in the SEMI TRUCK  I dont have all the unnecessary worries in life  no rent  no car note  no child support  i been to every state in the USA  I been to 75  of all casinos in the USA too  Life is so simplier now ,6,1

Enjoyed the video  I d predict he s back in CA within a year  Hard to leave a situation where you are around your family and pets  That said  Las Vegas has a lot going on and is a good place if you have the money to enjoy what s offered  Idk though  If you do go out  you ll be surrounded by people who are visiting with friends or family  Seems like an odd place to live alone  Quite a surprise really after the previous video which highlighted the hard water ,1,0
Enjoyed it ,1,3

OK  so playing Devil s advocate here  What if these things that make you happy and these things others do  that you see as  stupid   are just the same in the end  Isn t it just about doing what you need to for the end result  But personally  I agree 100  and funny enough  have been planning on Vegas as my  Central Ops   How do you like it so far ,3,1

I haven t been lucky enough to make it to a spot where I can do what I actually want to do but I m definitely taking notes from what you re doing  Thanks to knowing what I want I know that I don t actually need to make as much money as I thought I did and I ve managed to get a job where I can work wherever I like and even whenever I like to an extent  I m down for a drink if you re ever over in Australia ,3,1
I personally agree with your philosophy 100   But I think some people just really enjoy decorating per se  some people enjoy being in the spotlight all the time  etc  I don t think elon musk even cares about money at this point  It s not always that they re stupid  or haven t thought of what we have  but some really do find personal fullfilment in   enter worthless activity     As they say  it takes all sorts to make this world   Love your new place ,1,1

People have different interests  different life styles and goals  Just because your interests are different than others doesnt necessarily mean that  others are not good enough  lame or odd  Perhaps those guys who did nothing but investing over and over again and eventually died with millions of dolars in their accounts were happy with what they d d with their lifes  You never know  I suggest you to be more modest because it seems you are out of your mind and at the same time being rude especially when you said  everybody else is stupid  ,1,1
Im the stupid one noOooO   I am not worthy TechLead  You are right  Who was ex top shot caller at google  Not me  YOU   ,1,1
No YOU RE stupid  I M the smart one   ,1,1
For all his talk and self justification  I think he is just lonely  Even with all the travelling he plans  he will never get away from that loneliness  I m beginning to suspect it s just his depression talking  Until he deals with that loneliness he will forever be unsatisfied  Remember  no man is an island  We live in a society ,25,8
hes lonely because he knows of no one who is like him  i can relate,3,
He reminds me of Kanye  but he s a little less transparent about his mental health  Ever sinceKanue  he lost his mom and now with his divorce his mental health has been terrible  Money doesn t seem to fix that ,2,
It s too late he s arrogant and blind trying to speak away his loneliness  All the trash talking  hustling  has finally caught up to him  He doesn t even look young anymore anymore  Just look at him now and 4 years ago  He looks ally older man  YouTube fame isn t worth it and flexing on people  It took him long enough to find this out ,2,
Let s talk soon,1,
I don t disagree with anything you ve said      but I do think you would benifit from friendship  maybe just different people than you ve met so far  I think you should do shrooms  10 10 recommend ,1,1

Best thing I ever did  Packed a backpack  flew to Bangkok  traveled from there for some time only with a rough plan and direction  staying flexible and spontaneous  enjoying the adventure and not having to justify anything for anyone ,63,6
 EUGINIUM Actually  its cheap because you have to stay in hostels  I did this even at the old age of 35  It is only  5 10 a night  and cheaper as you go to cheaper countries than Thailand  Hostels are also best to meet people  a must if you are traveling single   It is very cheap as a 2 week trip I have planned to vegas is going to cost me like  130 a day  vs around  10 a day in South east Asia ,4,
 EUGINIUM Those countries are super cheap  Just save several thousand  The people are great there ,6,
 Fighter4Street Where do you even get that sort of money to begin ,3,
Yes  that is what I did also  I flew to Bangkok without any kind of planning at all  Just the intent that I would jump to the next country when my 30 day visa ran out  so I jumped to Cambodia then to Vietnam  met a lot of people on the way  Was a great part of my life and plan to do it again soon ,5,

At bottom  these life philosophies you are talking about like  health  wealth  time  and youth  and  die with zero  have a purpose that ultimately revolves around YOU and what you want out of life  The most fulfilling lives are those lived for a purpose BEYOND YOURSELF  Find one and devote your life to it and you will be better for it ,1,0
Success is what you define it to be  You just need to meet the right girl ,2,1

I moved to Arizona from California   I did not bring leftist politics to Arizona for a simpler life  I wanted a base as well that wasn t a high cost of living area  I was sick of the traffic  taxes  insane woke   liberalism there  And now with work from home  I have no reason to live anymore in California  I m close enough that I can visit whenever I need to  and with work from home can travel on weekends  Enjoy the journey  you need to make enough money but you also want to enjoy some of what you make along the way  Just don t get caught up in the rat race you forget about living your own life    California is toxic for those reasons  It s a great place to get a start but you don t want to finish there,2,0

You are a deep guy  I get your depression  Just know that this thing you are feeling is just being  a smart  human  We all have it  Some more  some less  In time you will realize that life is only worth living  because  of other humans  Even if you don t see them face to face  So you should be thankful to them  and even consider giving something back to humanity  Heck maybe this is what Elon is doing after all  Peace TL ,1,0

 TechLead   always Dropping KNOWLEDGE   ,1,1
I agree  TechLead  I do watch a few YouTubers  but try to keep my social media to a minimum  I also don t watch the mainstream news  as it is designed to depress us and keep us fighting amongst outselves  One of the best things I ever did for myself was ditch my 3 bedroom house   and all the STUFF in it  and become a minimalist  You don t realize how much energy you put into curating your  stuff  until you re not doing it anymore  I have lots of extra money   if for no other reason  I don t do any  retail therapy  and don t buy anything that I don t really need  and I have lots of time now  I d much rather have a real conversation with a real person  THAT is way more important to me  I fully support your choice  TechLead  I do hope that you continue to make some videos  though  I would miss you if you left the space completely  Good luck ,56,3

Good on you  I made the move to a simpler lifestyle a few years back    moved from the Bay Area to the mountains of Northern Nevada and love it  You should consider Northern Nevada  Tech Lead  Reno is up and coming     a more welcoming friendly city than Vegas IMO  less than a 4 hour drive from the Bay Area  with flights available as well   and 45 minutes from Tahoe  Still dry  but better climate than Vegas  Almost all the benefits you cited about Vegas  but IMO a better quality of life ,2,1

Been doing what you did for about 2 decades now  Felt the way you have for 3 decades   Get a mansion for what  Get a fancy car for what  Do what truly fulfills you and close the book   By now you ve learned most who said you couldn t were wrong  most who said you shouldn t were jealous and most who said you wouldn t doubted your mettle to do so  So what good were they  Their range of feelings and desires by and large saw you as a placeholder for THEIR plans so even that calls into question their so called love for you  Your actual needs were largely ignored in spite of your struggles  risk or pain  That s why you like the desert  you see exactly what you re working with without everyone else s emotional and social clutter ,178,9

The thing is  to some people building a business s is the sole thing that makes them feel alive  To them  traveling might sound like a waste of time  or even something that s too say and therefore not challenging enough because traveling is something anyone can do  To some people building a house  decorating it and making it cozy and homey is more fun than traveling because they are more artistic and they enjoy taking something plain and leave a mark on it  They get a kick at making things better just for heck of it  We are all different  no one is stupid  Some of the comforts you enjoy in life can only exist because of people who are living a  mundane  life  Know what I mean ,1,1

I m no psychologist but I d say this guy has some issues  I doubt he travels much or does much besides staying in his apt  In front of his computer  How s his daughter   Does he care since everyone is so stupid  Perhaps getting out more would be good for him but there seems to be a deep fear to do that as well  Dark dingy computer rooms might make you a lot of money  but do they make you happy ,1,0

honest question  how many people are signing in your programs  ,2,1
Good to have you back  I miss your intelligent topics to discuss and reflect upon ,2,1
 totally agree with what you are saying   I started in crypto in August 2017  and I bought in   I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85  during the ensuing 4 year bear market   I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do   I wish I had bought more   I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Michael Wei I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor Michael Wei who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market   ,4,6
