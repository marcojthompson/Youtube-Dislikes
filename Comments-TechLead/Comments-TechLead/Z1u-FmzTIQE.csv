 Karl Lentz yes  one can leave  child support hell   No men should go there in the first place  But some men are too dumb or just unwilling to avoid it  Instead they try to solve it  by just working harder  wich makes things even worse  I really struggle to understand this male behavior ,1,

 Griffy DZ Yes  I hope we will change laws  not just in the US  It s about time  I just had to  wake up  another guy  real life friend  as he got separated by his wife TODAY  He was totally unaware and unexperienced to his new  challenges   Ordenary men are so illusional and unrealistic  when it comes to marriage  children and divorce reality  So  nobody cares  until he gets affected  That needs to change  along with the laws ,3,
Sending u my thoughts and some  good vibes  my friend   you  point out one of the MAJOR and  although widely known  yet  unfortunately persisting  flaw in this  system   RE  the paradox  that an abducter or witholder of the child  i e  the party acting in bad faith and or with the intentions of keeping a child away from the other party  infact BENEFITS by their bad faith and ill intent  due to the fact that courts defer  or at the very least  grant greater  scores  to the party that the child 1  is CURRENTLY WITH  and 2  WAS WITH THE LONGEST from the start of the period of separation   regardless of the circumstances that lead to the resulting product to those calculations      btw  you are LUCKY none of those  business  considerations were allowed or deemed legit etc  If they were  it would have only meant  more  monetarily and additional aspects of your life that is now in the  tarnished  silo and under the scope of the  arrangement   Regardless of the current impact and the other party s supposed disinterest  that can change from potential to  kinetic anytime in the future   ,1,

Once I got good at trading  women were throwing themselves at me  Fellow traders I know are now paying huge child support  Kids need to be taken care of of course  but be careful out there  There are all kinds of traps out there ,3,
wow the system sucks so bad and here in the UK is the same tbh   sad really,1,
Change your nationality   Example BUY a citizenship from another country like Dominica   St Lucia   Vanuatu   etc  and then   that would mean you don t have to pay  child support under American laws   Just give your son whatever amount you want like  2000 month,5,

Hello Techlead  I feel for you and respect the struggle  you intelligence make you KNOW FOR A FACT that things are going to be BETTER  I aslo feel for you because I know what Child Support did to other men  such as the men in this very intriguing video about a criminal described in a video called  The Disturbing Case of the House of Horrors Killer   Documentary   finnaly  in my religion  unliving  is PROHIBITED  meaning  inliving  HELL  so that s a shame for some  But i Believe in you  keep it up  Maybe even make a movement about child support  you have a voice and maybe can get your cause and all other men together and change the US laws  Cheers,4,
I m Brazilian  single mother  3 weeks ago a woman came up and said I was going to make a lot of money  i am new to cryptocurrencies  i believed in it and lost my savings  it was a thousand dollars  everything I had  I m sick and if I don t pay for school and rent I m going to take my 9 year old daughter  I am very sad  I don t trust anyone else  People are bad ,3,
Spiritually you have to accept it and try to put all pride aside and find your son  Don t get revenge  Get him to love you and meet you  Forgive his mother she will have to see the consequences in time ,9,

dark joke warning   so if you abduct the child  the other party ends up supporting you until they abduct the child back ,1,1
I am a proud father and believe it s my obligation to take care of my daughter   But the laws in this country are still very much weighted towards the mother and not seeing that it takes two people to make a child and raise them   I have been financially crushed for about 15 years   Living in a one bedroom apartment while the mom lives in a brand new home with cars  ponds in the backyard  etc   While claiming she is living in poverty to have child support maximize her benefits  Most of which do not go to my child   The system does not recognize the fathers trying to do good   This video really resonated with me   I am still hopeful that crypto maybe will help me one day in getting ahead while I continue to advocate for real changes to family law ,1,2

You have my sympathies  man  I myself have never gone through this situation  but everyone says it will financially kill you if you have to pay child support  Unfortunately  it seems to be that the only way to escaping this is having no children and never cohabitating  Sad world to live in ,3,1
 TechLead  you are just saying my story  you are very valid  when they know your weakness mostly knowing how so much attached you are to your son  they will take advantage of that just to get at you  But the real thing is that they are been selfish not to consider the feeling and welfare of the boy    But don t worry my friend  in the end  you will win  patience is the weapon and game here ,1,1

Obviously  she s trying to rob you  You did contribute a child support in a different way but she was greedy and asking for more  In this case you have to use asset protection  Good luck ,1,1
Sorry to hear about this  Lawyers and courts are something I despise and would never want to get back into ,1,1

Hi TechLead  I ve watch several of your videos and this one struck me the most cuz I m in the beginning of a divorce   Not be able to see my children daily one is nearly 1 year old and the other one is 2 5 year   is devastating and sure takes something away inside you as a man and a provider   Stay strong brother and awesome that your doing your videos  as the internet is so traceble and your kid will grow and able to see his father in the end  I m going to take your course to earn more for my living and my kids as well  hope not to go similar path and ending that they be abducted as well   Regards,1,2
I will never get married in this freemason satanic western world are you crazy     ,2,2

Women end 75  82  of marriages  win 92 94  of custody cases and men have to pay the child support  Around 50  of marriages in the US end within 5 years  Men are more prone to suicide after divorce  These are just a few of many other terrible statistics affecting men due to divorce ,1,1
Moral of the story  don t be a cheapskate in life like this guy   Had he afforded more than a  25 gift card for his wife on his 6 figure salary  he probably would have still had 2x his net worth now  his son by his side and some semblance of dignity from his viewers ,1,1

Wow  I am sorry to hear this  Subscribed  liked  and following your content  I have seen your videos before but now I want to support you more man  As a dating coach  I often see terrible situations come out of divorce for men such as this lack of rights for child visitation child support etc  It is really harsh treatement based on outdated civil law ,2,2

The child support system is   abused by spiteful women  My husband is paying child support on a kid that doesn t even live with his ex wife  The kid lives with the grandparents  We aren t even able to see her  We have kids together that try to call and his ex wife blocked them from having a sister  I just hope and pray these children still want a relationship later  I hope his daughter doesn t end up brainwashed  The money aspect is God awful  There are so many laws my husband gave up and pays this woman more than he can even afford  Even though the kid doesn t live there ,2,2
I m sorry for you and the other men that go through this BS  Not all women would do this  but most would  SO    men reading this  do NOT have a child with these women in the US  The courts will rip you to shreds  and you ll end up paying for your child  whom you will probably never see  despite  shared custody    These Feminists aren t worth it  Use a condom  pull out  refrain from shallow sexual urges    whatever you gotta do to avoid the Jewish founded Feminist movement  and its associated consequences   Damn  No condom  No lube  Just a straight  hard fucking when you get the state involved in your relationships ,1,2
Tryna til these youngins  All woman r the same ,1,2
Sure  So why did she leave such a kind and loving man such as yourself  I would have thought it would never have entered her mind  Abducted  So    Its not her child either  Evidently not yours since the idea of paying child support just ruined your life ,1,2
Men  book mark this video  download it and refer to it when you feel the urge to marry and have kids ,1,2
I m a woman    I search for this kind of info because it doesn t get talked in the media  I think its important to put yourself in the other gender s shoes  It creates a well  rounded person     Didn t think the system was this bad  didn t think the common woman would exploit it  I m a conspiracy theorist kinda girl and im sure there is a reason why single  mother households are being incentivized  This world hates anything pure ,1,2
Bro do a video on the dreaded A word   Alimony,1,2
The old system of assuming women are always the victim and always the one who needs financial support is very outdated and needs to be change  Many women nowadays are heartless  greedy  and cunning  They just want to abuse the system and make use of marriage and children to satisfy their own material greed  Many women nowadays are working and earning quite a huge income ,1,1

Good ol  Patrick went from blue pill to red pill in the most brutal way possible  The bigger you are  the harder you fall  That s why I advise guys to learn exactly how this cesspool of a society works before you get rich and successful  If it catches you on the wrong foot while you are at the top  the consequences can be devastating  Never marry or cohabitate in the west  And I would also advise you install cameras in your house and hold a concealable recording device on you  Fake sexual assault allegations are a dime a dozen these days ,2,1

Getting married in the west is dumb go out of the country if you want success know the rules before you play the game,1,2
Children  their quality of life  and wellbeing are the LAST THING CHILD SUPPORT COURTS AND A LOT OF WOMEN CARE ABOUT  Women breakup homes families waaaaaaay more than men and for vain and other unnecessary reasons at that  Any woman that s willing to keep  or even just try to keep  their children away from their father for some bitter reason s  are the WORST child bearers and shouldn t even be called a mother  And ANY woman that tries to justify it are the worst  An absolute poor excuse  You do NOT and cannot honestly love your children if you re willing to unnecessarily take keep away literally one of  if not  the most vital  important  and necessary part of their life  their father  solely because of spite  How can you be or even call yourself a mother  let alone a good one  if your bitter anger and making him mad is more important to you than the quality of your children s life and doing  being  and having the best for your child  The fact that you re willing to put your own children through extremely unnecessary  and possibly lifelong  trauma  and do it PROUDLY at that  just proves why the child ren  should never be automatically given to the child bearer because anyone willing to purposely cause trauma  unnecessary trauma  to their own children to make someone else mad is NOT fit to have children  let alone full or even just majority custody ,1,1

 Joseph Demchalkson That s a risk  but they re a lot less common than divorce  Maybe 1 in 50  or even 1 in 30  but definitely not 1 in 2 like in the case of divorce   Also men can win against false rape allegations a lot easier than child support alimony custody hearings   I know because I ve been falsely accused before  hired a lawyer  and won without ever having to even talk to a cop or go to court ,2,

Bro  Getting laid and not getting rinsed out by family court aren t mutually exclusive ,1,
This is why I don t get married  Dumex is more expensive than Durex  and both of those supply for life is just 1 4 of child support  As I know it  no US legal way to get you out of this  I don t know what will happen if you move  say to India  and leave your US citizenship  Maybe in that case you won t be charged anymore because US don t have jurisdiction over India   no more US tax  Could be easy if you really decide to retire  Instead of paying for child support  you d be paying for food poisoning medication instead ,1,2
Nah  just needs his money ,1,
of course I see a complete absence of women in the comments   this wont stop happening until they agree its unfair and evil,1,2

I beat the child support system  There are ways to lower the amount  Your first mistake was getting a lawyer  But you can lower the support my friend  if you can t fight for visitation  You can fight to lower your support  Accept the fact that you ll never see your son anytime soon  That s the hardest pill to swallow  Get therapy  Once you get over the emotional aspect  which many of us fathers have to go through  you ll be in the happiest point of your life ,1,3
Being alienated from your child and being obligated to pay child support can ruin a man and you are right about that  Things like this no surprising why men are  going their own way  as the system is rigged against men  Yet feminists keep saying men are  privileged  and women are  oppressed  ,1,2

Your ex spouse is going to be living large  But  you know that after three years   your ex wife can drag you back into court and demand an increase in Child support   The case comes under review every three years  to see if your earnings have increased   If so  you re going to be made to pay more  Maybe you should pack up and move to Japan  to be closer to your child   Because  otherwise   you ll probably never see the baby   With you having a YouTube business   you should be geographically mobile  Think about it  Don t lose more time with your baby ,1,0

When this situation happended to me  i left my wife   she said that she will take from me every   she can   She asked 6500k  us  month and all fees paid for the child   So I chose to start med school at 30 for 100k us year paid upfront for 8 years and not woking anymore for this as good reason in court   Taking care of my son study   Then i asked my sister  Lawyer  to just talk to the Lawyer of my ex for 5 10h  week at 400k  h and send insane huge files   The mother did bankruptcy very quickly  made to me appologies and swears to never ask a     Now our deal is very clear  every bill for the kid is 50  and There is no problem at all since 8 years and i finished my medschool in march   My advise is   prepare having a credible way to not work and drain your money as a project that no one can contest or see as a Strategy   Use it as a shotgun   For example for me it was going to China and or going to medschool   I never refused to pay anything needed to my son  But i refused to give to her mom money because of her ego ,2,1
Honestly  first you are a great guy  that is what I feel  Second  I truly feel that your former partner was not fully committed to you  she was more with you possibly because you were financially successful  And that is the problem when you are successful financially  it is always very hard to find a woman who is genuine  not focused mainly on your money and instead focused on building a family long term and the word long term is what is important  I hate to say it but your previous partner was probably another gold digger  You certainly did not deserve all the pain that you went through with this former partner  All the best to you  TechLead ,1,2

I m not sure how this works in the UK vs USA  but paying a percentage is just ridiculous and i suspect unfairly impacts men  No women s equality there right   Surely it should based on proven reasonable needs of the child  Maybe if your paying more you should be entitled to care for your son full time other than your ex  But again i m sure in that regard it disproportionately favours mothers  Again where s the equality     How much oversight will you get on how this money is spent  The legal industry is just awful and they re making money out of everybody and perpetuating the actual issues for gain  No comment on your ex s criminal actions       i m lost for words     I commend the way you re handling it,1,0

My ex cheated and still got full custody  I was paying  1000 mo   medical insurance which came up to another  350 mo  After everything was deducted from my paycheck taxes  child support and medical insurance I was clearing maybe  200 a week  That s working full time making damn near  20 an hour   I was forced to be homeless for YEARS living in a car and sometimes camping at the local campground in a tent  taking showers at the local YMCA and washing my clothes at the laundry mat  On top of that she has completely cut me out of my daughters life  She moved to Massachusetts  got remarried and the courts will do nothing to help   It sucks and depressing  I understand why a lot of guys put in the situation commit suicide every year   I have had a lot of people tell me they would not pay the child support  The problem with that is if you stop paying child support the first thing they do is suspend your drivers license  then they drag you in a court  and force you to pay child support or go to jail for 30 days then when you get out you have 30 days to come up with the money or they send you back to jail for another 30 days and it becomes an endless downward spiral to oblivion that you will not escape  You can t get a job because you ve been in jail for the last 30 days and you can t catch up because back child support keeps piling up higher and higher  Even after your child turns 18 you still owe the money  it never goes away  You re just fcked spending the rest of your life in and out of jail every other month  I used to be a court officer and have seen this firsthand ,551,54

Please continue the comment  I am from Egypt  a Muslim country and the laws are much worse  where you have to pay a sum of money before marriage with an average price of 30 000 dollars  After divorce  you pay alimony according to the years you spent with her  the minimum amount you pay for 2 years  even if you sit with her one day  If you sit 3 years  you pay for 3 years  If you sit 4 years  you pay only 4 years  Thus  endlessly  the expense of the pleasure can reach 50 000 dollars if your income is average  pay alimony to the child more than half of your salary  and take your home unless the male reaches the age of 15 years and the female until you get married and pay a late after divorce  the average price is  30 000 ,1,

The only reason I said anything is because people need to know how broken the system is and what could happen if you make the wrong decisions   like refusing to pay child support  if you re put in the same position  If I didn t see first hand what happens I may have made the same mistake  Hopefully one day maybe we can change this broken biased system that s responsible for destroying families   lives  You should always support your children but if it destroys you in the process   that doesn t benefit the child at all ,17,

I ve seen this before  Child support payments causing father s to be homeless   Disgusting,78,
I apologize for your loss   ,1,0
Well  Sh t the bed  I learned something today  So THIS is the reason why a high percentage of mothers  70  of divorces requested by women  stop the father from seeing the kid    Notice how common it is near the end of the relationship they start acting up  making every single thing you do seem like the WORST thing on earth and that despite you know you have been a loving loyal partner and father you are suddenly a  monster   Just like that   Well here s your reason guys  The longer the father doesn t see the child  the MORE they will get from a financial outcome   The level of manipulation  CONSCIOUSLY destroying the family  And then putting out restraining orders even at a sniff if if you make contact with her to see your own child    Why isn t this classed as human cruelty   What makes me sick is the projecting of all women as a victim class group when the abduction of children  whether purposely breaking down a relationship knowing the father is innocent  preventing visitation  or actually abducting a child with no communication  It makes me sick when this is so common   What is worse than losing your own child    Again  Why is this not classed as human cruelty ,1,0
I m very sorry to hear about this  I only found your channel today but I relate quite a bit to your views on things  and also as a father in the same situation  Albeit shuffling around smaller figures  but the same situation more or less  Only a father who cannot see his son can understand a father who cannot see his son  This is an atrocity in today s society  And while all us fathers suffer  our children suffer an even greater loss  If only there was some way to change the way this system works  Stay strong my friend  I know       ,1,1
Guys  your money NEEDS to be hidden  Perhaps you can do something with crypto today  But back in my day  it was offshore banking  I had stashed away pretty much everything in offshore banking   When the ex booted me  to bail a guy out of jail and marry him    she figured I had next to nothing except the clothes on my back   She was thrilled at the thought she was getting the  modest  house and that I d be on the street with only a few clothes   I endured close to this image for a few years   and eventually brought back several hundred thousand dollars to up my lifestyle again  A much later disclosure of finances through a child support modification had her furious when she saw it all in my investment statements   She wasted a ton of her time and money trying to get at it but was told it was too late at this point   Hide your money folks   No matter how  perfect  that woman seems   They turn nasty and down right evil with the thought of easy money ,2,1

Omg  my instincts saved me  This happened to me 2 5yrs ago  my ex wife abducted my then 2 yr old daughter  luckily she was in same city and I was able to convince her we do equal time with my daughter for daughers own well being  and that really helped me in divorce settlement and child support  techlead is spot on  never give up time with your child the child needs father   and of course stops from your spouse abusing in family courts    I am a tech lead  i have amassed huge sums from crypto AFTER our divorce  it still scares me to live a decent life due to the fear of my ex wife coming after more child support although we still spend equal time with the child    As a man  u are fookd  I spend around 30k too with lawyers so far  and wasted hundreds of hours of my valuable time which i could use to make bread for my daughter    I have come back stronger and making multi 7 figures income now  D   Stay safe men  Always sign prenup before marriage and have a plan for worst case  I would look into Monero  XMR   ,1,0

The laws are intended to discourage marriage and to discourage keeping marriages intact because these tend to result in a higher birth rate which exacerbates the effects of things like climate change  If the powers that be wanted people to get married  and have kids  which is what married people tend to do   the laws would be different  They  and the scientists who work for them  are not stupid ,4,0

That s normal  They are running a business  not a charity  Every service provided is accounted for and charged  That said  there was a time when physical charges like fax and photocopies were NOT charged  since it was included in the hourly rate  This is similar to mechanics  There was a time when they did not charge  shop  fees ,2,

Honestly tho just my opinion any one who would choose to take their child away from the parent and then egregiously take them to court to drain them financially is evil  I really hope she gets the bad karma ,1,1
Very informative and thanks for the insight into all this  It really makes getting in a relationship and having kids a huge gamble on your life  I know everyone has different standards of living  but even a 6 figure salary being taxed with child support is criminal ,10,1

There is a deeper reason than just money as incentivizing the breakup of families and the destruction of a societal nuclear family provides greater control and enslaves the populous  Single mothers dependent on the state  Fathers unable to properly raise children left poor and unable to properly participate in the future  children becoming lost and easily indoctrinated to the whim of the system ,1,1
They got me  and I was far from a millionaire  Similar story  but I could not afford a lawyer then  I had to pay double  because I did not keep receipts for everything I bought  or money I gave  which was half my money every month at the time   Still recovering from it   I was 20  It was many years ago  Hard lesson  for doing nothing wrong   ,2,1
This sounds like an issue with California family law  which might be undermining your overall income  Alternatively  you can probably move to Japan and work with you former spouse regarding spending more time with your son  When you re in Japan  renegotiate your child support payments according to Japanese family law  Good luck buddy  WAGMI,2,1
Your summary of family law is spot on   I had the EXACT same experience   Once the lawyers know how much you make  if you re a high earner  they will make sure to take as much as they can from you    The laws require that you file a financial affidavit so there s no way to prevent the lawyers from knowing how much you make   I spent over 80K on attorneys  fees in my divorce and over 90K paying for my X s attorney s fees   Meanwhile the X was making over 130K per year     The lawyers make the laws that gives them the advantage   The judges and lawyers know each other   They collaborate knowing how much you make and they intentionally suck you dry   On my final judgement for dissolution of marriage  I owed money   And I had to pay child support  ransom  ,6,2
It makes me think twice about ever having a child or marrying,1,1
i honestly don t understand how you could lose this case  its almost like the justice system is an abhorrent joke,1,0

My childhood was watching all this unfold between my parents  every nasty trick in the book and the divorce process lasted 3 years due to simply falling out of love  ultimately financially dad got 25   mum got 50  the lawyers got 25   for some strange reason men have to pay for everyones legal fees and they end up losing a quarter of everything to the lawyers who are meant to solve the problem in the first place  but they always bleed out the men becoz men put up less of a fight  so I ve been MGTOW for 20 years now and its absolutely wonderful  I don t have to answer to anyone and don t let anyone live with me ,346,17
 Yorgen Ibn Strangle Although she never took any responsibility and was happy the way she dragged us innocent sons into all the legal chaos and years of torture during school and university  faking all sorts of horrific things for financial gain  I decided later  after 15 years of resentment to go to her in person and forgive her for all the suffering she caused  i have one brother who is an alcoholic now  the other developed bipolar and is addicted to prescription benzos  and I developed severe OCD and anxiety disorder from the extreme stress  i even told her that i apologised for judging her because i began to hate her  i believe you become like what you hate and i needed to move on by doing the hardest thing which was to forgive her in person and remove her spirit from my life as a result of choosing not to hate  since i did that i barely ever see or talk to her as i didnt even think about her much anymore and i was able to quit smoking  drinking  junk food  and i lost weight got fit and the OCD is gone and anxiety disorder is now manageable just with exercise and relaxation techniques  She will never change or see the error of her ways  but ultimately moving on with my life is a responsibility i have to myself  one day i may be healed enough to have a family of my own and be able to trust again  Until then i really enjoy the peace and ease of living and working for myself doing whatever i want  i never get lonely either and have some great friends and my relationship with my father is now better then ever ,1,
 IWantMyVisionBack I don t give advice  I give  comments   another fabrication of yours  but you read into it however you want mate  if you want to go through life thinking people insinuate this or that you will end up insane  Fact if you never asked me what I think becoz you cannot communicate properly  so let me do it for both of us   You  what can men do if things are this bad  Me  do everything you can to build a trusting and loving relationship with shared values   See that s how men communicate  it s easy bro  ,5,
 Personal Freedom It doesn t matter if I use the word  sound  or insinuating    Your post is insinuating that men shouldn t bother signing a prenup because it can get thrown out anyway because a woman can say she signed it under duress    That s terrible advice  If a man decides to get legally married  he SHOULD form a prenuptial agreement with his partner ,1,
 IWantMyVisionBack I don t want anyone to do anything  If you don t like the way  I sound  then don t respond  Only women have ever told me they don t like the way I sound  or they don t like my  tone   That s a subtle way to gaslight someone by ascribing motivations to them that they never stated  nor did you bother to clarify first before ascribing them  Tsk tsk  End rant   Anyhow if you have to go to those legal lengths then it s a moot point as you found the wrong woman anyhow  Ultimately  lawyers can t build a trusting relationship for us with their paperwork ,5,
 Personal Freedom there are clear ways to prove that she was not under duress or coerced into signing any prenups   You sound like you are telling men not to even bother signing a prenup with that level of thinking   You can have her sign it in front of a lawyer  You don t even have to be there  Go over the prenup with your lawyer and her lawyer present  Agree to the prenup and she can sign it whenever she wants with a lawyer present ,2,
 Personal Freedom Amen ,2,
You can sign a prenup that can state that each party has to pay for their own lawyer fees   Urge every man to either not get married or get a prenup and postnuptial agreement ,4,
 manictiger yep  the whole idea of  passing on your legacy  is all pure ego  who cares if you replicated   it is so expensive to go down that route  and these days most marriages are just very slow burglaries    i mean look at techlead  she literally stole his son and there was nothing he could do   When you get married you are signing a legal contract that can only hurt you and gives her the permission to take all your stuff and kids for no reason at any time  in the state i live  judges can overrule and dismiss your pre nup agreements at their discretion  and if she lives with you unmarried for 2 years then she is legally considered to be married to you as defacto  so never do the whole live in thing is my advice  my friends who are married always have to check in with their wifes and get permission for everything  even if they can use the bathroom during dinner time   i run my own business and buy whatever i want  like recently i wanted a new pricey fender guitar amp to add to my collection  so i just got 3 of the same to put in each room so i can blast music wherever and whenever i want  you think  she  would allow this  I think not ,37,
Dude I sometimes think of you as a kinda unemotional cynical person that s somehow funny yeah but also purely rational  This video must be something that s really hard for you   I highly appreciate the work and transparency you put into your content   I changed my mind bout you   ,6,2
Your content older was great however  despite your constant reassurance that your blatant insults targeting your ex wife aren t personal  are simply a lie  Almost every second video has an a very obvious remark demeaning her and your argument that the reason you call your son  the kid  doesn t even sound sincere  Using words like  abduction  for a mother trying to raise her child without his bitter and certainty unpleasant father in her home country sounds some what reasonable   Millionaire or not  you seem to have made your self the victim because you  wanted to give them a good life  with your money  Chances are you ll never realize that a Man has a duty further than just being the financial provider and will forever lie to yourself that you were the perfect partner in your relationship  Your mentality and expression towards these matters  reminds me of someone i m related to and all i or anyone related to them can think of them is how unpleasant they are as human beings and how they have no depth in their character or personality and the only thing that they seem to care about is how much their money means to them ,1,1
Chicks that are a bit egoistic can be appealing  just double check before really getting into it   invested in them ,1,1
Somebody needs to save these videos before his ex wife forces him to delete them fearing  The Kid  would watch them and make her the villian when he s older ,1,1

This is crazy how the system works like this I have a few friends going threw the same thing idk why is not good enough to take care of your kid you could even be willing to pay for everything your kid needs but nooo   They won t even let you see your kid or let you see your kid like once a year just to get more money people who do this are going straight to H  lll idc what anybody says having a kid is a blessing and for you to love your kid to the fullest and not be able to see him spend time with and having to pay the mother so she can live good it s just inhuman,1,1

This is why you get a prenuptial agreement before you get married personally I say do not get married at all there s no benefit for men it only works out for the woman that just guarantee that she gets half of your money for the rest of her life remember prenuptial agreement if you really have to get married I think just don t get married at all,1,1

I was married too a austriain and we had 3 Son s after every son Was born she would literally get violent with me   After the 3rd son was born as he was 10 months old she flieder out again on me so i moved out for a few weeks hoping it would change her or make her understand that if you Mistreat someone or something you lose them  Instead she just had another man move in with her 3 weeks later still beleaveing that i wasn t good enough for her  We got devorst   I got too see the kids on the weekends and of course payed until they were 18 years old and had their own income  The austriains almost kicked me out of the country due too me being American and me haveing my visa taken away because i wasn t married to a austriain anymore but i got lucky as i fought it   Anyways 8 years later my EX got devorst again because like with me she got violent with him until she was taken too the Psychologie ward and they found she suffered for years from Depression that triggerd her violent outbursts  I hang out with my sons too this day and we have a great conection   I regret nothing    Life just live it bro,1,1
Thanks Techlead for the advices  You re really saving me from getting married and having a child ,1,1
Man  Having had a similar experience although not in an international case  I have a lot of sympathy for you  And if I had the opportunity to monday morning quarterback I d say you shoulda hired a Japanese lawyer and filed for emergency custody as soon as she left the country  Now the baby has established residency overseas yeah it is a clear cut case of how much do you owe ,1,1
I went through Child Custody in April 2001  Everything you are saying is exactly true  I am praying for you   and your son ,2,1

mothers around the world  they disgust me ,1,1
Sorry bro  I ve gone through the same thing  twice  You have the money  so the government will join in to extort you  You know this  And nothing will cure the pain you will feel over this  But your son will see it through his own eyes one day  and it ll all be ok  Stay strong  we all got nothing but love for you  Your a good dude  straight up  F the courts  the cops  and the government  But that s just my opinion  Keep your head up and do just 2 things,11,1
As a law student I worked in family court and this video makes ZERO sense  First it s very rare that one parent don t have any visitation right unless something really bad happened like constant family violence  not towards spouse but towards child   Judges are very reluctant to give single custody no visitations unless in extreme situations  since kids are better off if they have the chance to meet both parents physical distance does not mean no legal visitation m  kid can still come visit during holidays   Second  child support fees have been criticized long for being too low   you entered  70k monthly income and need to pay about 5k  How would that be too much for a parent who truly care for their child  Most cases i did rendered too little support ,1,1
honestly is insane what Western society does to young men these days    ,1,1
I didn t watch the video yet but didn t your wife stole your son and ran to Japan w o your permission   Isn t that kidnapping and how are you still responsible for child support ,1,1
Some foul stuff you went through,1,1
Well  as a MGTOW monk  i welcome you to MGTOW ,1,1

take 300 000 usdt put it in a 20   yield platform      the same 300 000  will pay your chilld support until he is 18  and afterward you will be able to have that 300 000  back   ,1,2
This is why MGTOW is a thing   the only winners in family court are the lawyers and usually the woman  Sorry for your situation though ,3,2
that s what you clowns get for getting married  they ll use your child against you and make you seem like a bad father  you will never win in family court ,2,2
Dont get married its a trap if your gonna have a child there should be legal paperwork were both parents are responsible for the child ,2,2
Poor guy never marry bois its to dangerous  ,1,2
Dam  Watching you experience all this is like witnessing my favorite anime character being in a situation that you don t want to see them in    It s sad seeing a brother in this predicament,8,1
It s crazy to get married or have children in this day and age ,1,1
People suck ,2,0
Sorry to say  but that wh re really doesn t deserve you one bit and you need to file a criminal lawsuit against her for just stealing your son without even telling you about it  You are his father you have equal rights over him too  And just because she is a nut job  you shouldn t be wasting your hard earned money on her  Get your life together man ,1,1
Don t get married in America  Don t have a child in America       Get married and have children in an Islamic country  Islam protects the rights of men and women in marriage and divorce   ,1,2

   stay strong brother ,1,2
I m aware of your situation  I m sorry about the outcome  I m a Nanny and most of the time the mothers don t even spend half the money on the child or children  They fund their own lifestyles and the child just lives with them  I think you might need to put your foot down and make some house rules for all  3  of you guys ,2,2
Sorry to hear it   Going through a similar thing myself   It sucks   Thanks for talking about it ,1,2
Thanks for sharing,1,2
Still doing good work through out all that trauma   Stay  Hard   stay strong Stay giving value to young men around the world,1,2
I have been  still am  in the exact same situation  kids taken away and used as pawns for retaliation  crazy legal bills  disproportionate child support  etc    Keep your Stoic approach my friend  Marcus Aurelius type  and I hope you will get to spend some good father son time with your kid one day  He will also probably see those videos one day  and therefore  it s important not to blame his mum  like you are doing  it s very noble   even if it is tempting and could be justified   because it would only damage his mental wellbeing ,1,1
As fast as I can afford it I m supporting every venture of yours I can afford  Hearts heal slowly  Thank you for everything you ve brought us,3,1
Just pay it  Your kid will understand how much you love him in few more years   I do feel you are lucky enough to get rid of your ex  Seems she love   better than you ,4,1
Governments have turned family conflict into business  Worse  they politicize it  demonizing one group and giving special protections to others  Can government get any more disgusting and oppressive  I m sorry about the sitrep  friend  and hope you continue finding peace ,1,1
I m sorry she divorce grape you  TechLead  I had a feeling that was coming  she seem like a typical American woman  But to be honest I m surprised men are still getting married these days  It s a terrible idea ,5,2
You can t trash her  She is already trash ,1,1
I m sorry for your loss  I hope this experience doesn t break you and you grow stronger  Nobody without a son knows the pain in your heart  God bless you and your son x,1,1
Why even get married ,2,1
Alhamdulillah for Sharia law  And I am saying this as a woman  The injustice in the described  justice  system is beyond my imagination  I am really sorry for what you and your son have to go through  None of us can know how things were between you and your wife  but this actually does not matter when it comes to you and your son being able to be part of each other s life  And then the financial aspect of all of this   ,52,6
Stop the bs  you re talking about Abbasid  law  that ain t even set in stone neither  so stop that nonsense damnit ,3,
 60k x 12 years   child is now 6 yrs old     720K    saving you  280K,1,1
Coming back in to say she s nasty  Blocking you  I almost thought you simply didn t spent time with your child  but Of course i was wrong  If you can appeal the case and have corroboration for her blocking access to your child  you may lower the monthly costs ,2,1
Lol 5k to raise a kid  and here I am getting by on 1k per month  ,1,1
Welcome back  ,1,1
This video was very personal   Thanks for sharing  Be well ,1,1
leave youtube and take your bots,1,1
Praying for you  Stay strong,1,1
You are screwed  But  now that she has your pay   see your child  Spend time with your kid  She has to allow you the right to be with your child  Secondly  hide your money  she will get reminders to ask for more  Lastly  continue moving forward  And yes she is programming your child to tell her everything about you  Half of your kid is you ,1,1
Going through the same problem   It s refreshing and actually comforting knowing it makes complete sense to others and your not going mad       System is wrong in more than one way  in most every day lives,6,1
At this point i can no longer tell if this is satire ,1,1
if your only problem is money then you dont have a problem  well the problem is i dont have money ,1,1
We love you bro  Stay strong  You will be millionaire forever    ,13,1
Child support ruined me too my XWife abducted my daughter and alienated me  The judge immediately sided with her because she s  the mother   I know the pain you feel  I wish I could say time will make it better but it didn t for me  Now my daughter is grown  It s like being in prison with no visitation  I will say though  one day your son will find out the truth about how his mother alienated you and he will resent her for that  I hope my daughter finds out the truth too while I m still alive ,377,31
 Matsimurf   another reason is that men criminal rate is way higher than women children may not be at safe hands if  they live with a dad ,2,
 Hahaha T difficulty of birthing has no bearing on the courts decision ,1,
 Afro Shinobi sure I am not saying  the mother can take away her child but it is harder for a dad to take away a child from a mom ,2,
 Lats Niebling if it is easy to give birth why women win most of times from child custody cases ,2,
 Hahaha T If its so hard how come billions of women alive manage to do it    How many men play professional sport    Way less than women who give birth right  ,1,
 Hahaha T what does that matter ,2,
 Hahaha T what  That doesn t give you the right to just take the child from their father ,1,
 Hahaha T No it s not  Stop the cap ,3,
too be fair  she gave birth to that child that s a hard process ,3,
 Ocean Wave He has these videos at least to discover his Dad and his side of it,3,
Same man   same   its the worst ,7,
Man that s though  unfortunately  I guess there is also a danger that the child will not believe the truth and just side with the mother if he s not a strong independent critical thinker who doesn t just go off hearsay and actually requires first hand proof or otherwise admits that he doesn t really know   It reminds me of the end of breaking bad when the handicapped son sides with the mother after she attacked Walt with a knife  the son goes on to lie to the police telling them the opposite of the truth  that it was his dad who attacked his mom with a knife   ,3,
I m 35  my mom is separated from my dad  used to tell me the nasty things abt my dad  Hence there was some animosity during my teenage hood  My dad did try his best to make amends with me  not my mom   When I got married myself  raise my kid  working full time  I realised it s tough sometimes  So my relationship with dad got better  even when my mom threw tantrums at me  I ranted it to dad   Some of My friends around me are divorced  usually show little interest in kids and got bf outside marriage  In the women circle  it s a known thing to use kids to trap husbands and get money  Even in our 20s it s a known thing to also use kid to get bf to marry  Some women are boggled why bfs they dated for 5 10yrs havent pop the proposal  so that tactic is used   Silver lining  there are some genuinely good mothers who devote their life to their kids and work full time  draining them fully   There are but few  Cos their exs are not contributing to child support  so they tried make ends meet  Some ex hub declare bankrupt  Work as self employed but claims company is not earning money at all   Some married women in their 40s still living in fairy tales  Although I m a woman  I never spoke outright in disdain  cos those women will never get it  they talk abt love and sex how good lover their current  bf is  and retorted  my hub is dating too  why can t I    But I do find it dumb and ridicule amongst other gfs  Aka gossip  If u r not willing to support nurture and love a child till 18  dun have one  My gf was abused by her mom s bf since she was a kid  Her mom  out of desperation  needed to keep her man  let him molest my fren  When I spoke up to her mom and told her my fren her daughter  is being abused  she accused her of lying  Well all I can say is   There are all kinds of parents ,14,
Just out of curiosity  how was she  Is she the kind to party  what other traits  Genuinely curious  I am about to meet a woman who is  conservative  supposedly being a woman that I can trust when I am absent etc  Even more important  what caused the separation btw  Don t answer if dont want to  i am simply curious  i will probably read your answer and go do something else  again dont answer if you dont want to  or maybe answer partially ,9,
The same for me  I undestand you unfortunately,13,

Child support violated my life today  Took 5k out of my account after I d been paying monthly as it s not enough and she lied about arrears  Not to mention I just lost my job not that they care  FML  not even close to a millionaire ,53,8
I hope you get better soon bro there s always a light over the other tunnel stay safe and happy,2,

Send a msg ,1,
I hope my message reaches you  you have money and you have options  Between your divorce child support and taxes your income is getting reamed  I know  but moving forward I would say you can put all future businesses under trusted family members aka your parents and just handle the paperwork  Law doesn t care for morality  so you have an obligation to play within the rules as well  next up you also have the option of changing citizenship to say  French Guyana  where taxes are low and you will no longer be subject to legalities of US family law  which is woman dominated in the US ,27,3
 Master Yoda not everyone has the ability to be a nomad unfortunately,4,
Wow is that really an option  Why dont more fathers do it ,6,
That situation sux  but now I m looking forwards to more videos from you  IMO  it s best to wait for your wife to cheat on you and then divorce her  In Japan  in that situation and with the evidence  you wouldn t need to pay child support  Also  child support isn t enforced in Japan as far as I m aware   I am currently living in Japan ,2,3
He gets the worst of both worlds  The child support is enforced in California  and any custody order he gets will NOT be enforced in Japan ,2,
so many life lessons to be learned from you  amazing content ,1,1
TechLead  thank you for revealing to us all of these details of your life,3,1
You said you offered  1 million vs  5000 per month for 15 years is only  900k   You saved  100k didn t you ,2,0
Thank you for sharing Patrick  Very informative ,1,1
Sorry for anyone who has to go through this    Change in circumstances can trigger a re calc every 2 years in California   Visitation in the parenting plan is important because she can t play keep away   The best investment I ever made was a cell phone   100  controlled by me      Also  I got summers which is good enough to build the relationship   Just wait until the child hits puberty and things go crazy    Watch for language in the plan for  Secondary Education  support  This is a BS timebomb ploy to keep you paying after 18     Happiness is the best revenge  Exposing of their greediness  backstabbing and childish behavior to loved ones is a close 2nd,2,1
Man  you  and most of us  live in feminofashists state s   No wonder that things went this way ,1,1

This man i so on it  so trutfull in what he says   Very very few women are mature enough to cast out bitterness  and reconcile with their kids fathers  and set   boundaries  on their atourneys   Our young men are disengauging from dating and marriage at an alarming rate these days  and practicing safer sex   and  Getting vasectomy at younger ages from eroded examples set by the previous generation and the times    or circumstances of the times  Sad  Baby boomer age is long gone  and every generation since   more inactive ,8,1

I became a millionaire two months ago and found out my now ex girlfriend was trying desperately to get herself pregnant so she could leave me and file for CS but I secretly slipped a plan b in her food and thankfully avoided all that mess ,4,1
A legal victory leads to getting to see your child  At this point it s your personal well being at stake  and not money as you said  Good luck ,8,2
I m disgusted for you dude    ,2,1
As always the only person who suffers is the  child  they grow up with a bad taste in their mouth about both parents  it s very sad  that his life is worth more than any amount of money  Not having a go at you  but humans always base everything on what they can get  not on what is good for this child  Sorry for your pain  and I do think sometimes men get a bad wrap  No one should have the right to take your relationship with your child off you  that should be the child right ,1,1
Really doesn t surprise me  Women eh,1,1
Child Support is NOT about the child  Child support is the state making a profit from Social Security Title IV D  Incentive Payments to States   It is also a punishment where the judge orders dad to pay mom for the failed relationship  Nothing more ,32,8
 yuzhong huang no  mom is not taxed for child support  She gets it tax free ,1,
 yuzhong huang yes the man paid the tax when he earned it  Cs is not earned income  but she can use it as income to qualify for a loan or mtg  whether she is actually getting the money or not  And no judge will foreclose or evict a single mom so if she gets in somewheres and don t pay  she is again protected from the consequences of her actions by big daddy gov,1,
 Jory Oliver Texas  where I reside  gets much more than that  Texas collectes 76  more child support dollars than California even though we have 26  fewer residents  Child support is jot for children at all  it is a money making scheme for the state and the family law section of the state bar ,6,
This is true    The states get  1 of Fed money for every  1 they  collect  whether the participant is willing to pay or not ,2,
If a woman leaves the country with your child  file a Missing Persons report with the FBI  Next  contact the US Embassy in that country  if there is one  and have them refer you to an immigration attorney  Have them file to deport your child as the child will be in violation of that countries immigration laws  The ex will be facing criminal charges herself  That is how I have seen fathers get their child back and mom placed into custody if she tries to come back to the US ,1,3
 Orlando Marquez Definitely worth a try   ,1,
 GearZNet    the US Embassy there may have other options  they certainly have connections with government and do what they can to protect US citizens which your child is  Just an option ,1,
Japan is notorious for ignoring such attempts from what I hear ,1,
I m sorry to hear this awful story where a young child has no access to a great dad who he can learn so much from   Karma will deliver   The day when you are reunited will come  You are very fortunate that you can provide a substantial amount for your child   Hang in there ,3,1
Lol so you get your kid taken from you and then YOU have to pay for it   seems fair ,3,1
The reason men are walking away from dating and marrige     Lots of bitter women now days cant get boyfriends or  husbands   Dont do it men   Women today  way to imature on these subjects  way to oportunistic  I learned along time ago  the political world disengauged from family matters    and domestic world followed  and the   legal world turned it all into a finacial money market     All stemming from disenfranchising the creator  Or exchanging truth for lies ,1,0
A surrogate mother and a top grade nanny would have been a better use of money  I hate what they did to this world but the time of emotions is over  now is the time of cold blooded rationality ,1,1

Hey tech lead  My son going through same sh t now  No matter what he does they don t care   No lawyer s involvement yet   He is trying to settle custody times  The   part agreed   The whole thing is a mess  The legal system is built for the womans advantage  The man is considered the bad guy ,62,6
The man is the bad guy  until it comes time for armed forces    then it s his DUTY   Total BS ,3,
 Robert Herrera sorry  I got side tracked  yes it makes it 20x worse ,2,
 Frank Xavier Galindo  What makes it worse is when the father is doing the right thing  Putting up with all the BS regardless  Jumping through the hoops  Its like torture   Be safe ,4,
Yes indeed  I have seen this happen to my dad as well  He wasn t perfect by any means  but that still doesn t mean the legal system isn t biased ,4,
After hearing your story  I think I ll just stay single and never get married or have children  It sounds like nightmare  At least your a millionaire  and can afford to pay CS  I read some fathers go broke and homeless  Anyway  good luck with the family     ,134,17

 hannesRSA LOOOL     Sure buddy ,5,
 hannesRSA You re ignorant in thinking that if I just change that ll prevent someone else from leaving  This is why divorce happens  50  of the time divorce and 70  of the time she files  You can do everything right and still end up through that court system  If you think you can beat it  good luck  but you ve been warned ,6,

Sure he is financially secure but having your heart and trust broken based on not keeping the spouse happy is messed up  Child gone  she is manipulative  I would never trust a woman again they have too many options,5,
 hannesRSA  that requires you having to control the world  The reason is that a woman can leave for any reason ,15,
And they get sent to jail in US ,3,
 hannesRSA I m pretty sure you could populate a black hole before you could satiate a woman s greed ,43,

Not only that but some are driven to suicide  That s how bad they want to escape this painful world ,27,

Yeah bro   child support sucks  the system doesn t give a sh t about the fathers  I dealt with it having 2 kids by 2 different moms    but I made thru   you can too     It s just very painful on all levels ,6,1
As a millionaire  money isn t that important for me 11 25   Techlead,1,0
the reason why they USA authorities cant do anything is because he gave permission for her to go to japan  she just never came back  he got taken for a ride  I guess real intelligence has different levels  I m single and will never get married  fun on the weekends DiCaprio style baby ,1,0
If she can t afford to take care of the child why doesn t she just give the child to the father   ,1,0
i had that problem before   it s very very difficult   i m sorry for you bro   if you paid child support you have the right to see you son   i heard that by law your spouse can t take your son out of state or out of country    the best is just agree on each other   hopefully you get to see your son soon,11,1
First  a man shouldn t HAVE to pay money to see his own child  that s called kidnapping and ransom  Second  laws don t matter in a court room  They have a monopoly on violence and control of the propaganda machine  Laws apply to YOU not them ,3,
Boys needs their fathers  I hope things works out for you and your kid  Keep making great videos     ,3,1
these are my thoughts    why dont men learn   why   why   look at you  all destroyed and saying ok to any abuse your ex wife is willing to give you     why   why do men keep thinking  it ll be different for me  because we love each other     why      look  I am not technically as wise as you  but i aqm clearly much wiser than you in reality  i make slightly under 400K a year  so no great  no terrible  but it is all for me      i dont pay child support  i never will  i have a girlfriend and she know i will never under any circumstances marry her  and i refuse to have kids and be taking my manhood away  as you have had    look at how you sound     defeated    destroyed     all your tech inteligence served you for nothing    a simple woman destoryed you 1 and let you thinking that you should be ok  just drinking coffe and playing games  and that money is not important  so she can have it all     that is what you want your intelligence for   ad all the rest of men out there     jesus crist men  wake up for god s sakes,1,0

Straight facts,3,
 Dominik Chmielewski are sure you know the whole story  Were you grown enough to understand what happened between your parents that would cause your dad to run away    I am not trying to appologize for him  But as someone who is facing this situation  I can tell you that sometimes fathers want to do wonders but toxic moms won t allow them just to write the story their way   So sorry to know you had to live without your father but  make sure you understand what really happened ,9,
It s good that it s Mother s court cause mom s usually care about their kids more than dads  Too many  dead beat  dads that don t want to contribute to their kids  I m a man now  but when I grew up my dad disappeared from my life and tried to not pay   but courts forced him to an extent so that s good ,1,
textbook example of orwellian double speak   double think,3,
 K C I agree   Thank you,2,
In western or most of so called developed countries everyone is just divorced or at least married twice or thrice  having multiple children with different wives   throwing their parents in old age homes or hospitals      is this they call high class or to be rich     Or developed   In this matter my country INDIA  is nice    here we have SANSKAAR and do not throw parents outside of homes when they are old but live with them till death and take care of them  and do not divorce easily   as india has one of the lowest divorce rates   because in INDIA  at least for most people divorce is not the answer people try to adjust and try to talk  donot betray the trust    ,1,1
I think sometime you have to adjust and make sacrifices  This man is EX GOOGLE TECH LEAD  EX FACEBOOK TECH LEAD  EX HUSBAND  EX DAD ETC I THINK I HAVE heard your side of story and not you wife as why she ran with your 3 year s old child if she was living happily       I think    something is wrong in your attitude   arrogance etc because i don t know your personal life nor I want too  maybe   you didn t focused on your family for money    and business  Just tell me one thing when his wife left 3   4 years ago  taking his 3 year s old child   his most important thing in life     why didn t he followed them to Japan   but he didn t go or have any contact with them  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY BEFORE DECIDING    ,1,0

I have had the same experience with the system  The way it is set up is not fair  I had tried leaving my former career as a trucker to become a software engineer like I had always wanted  Quit my job  got enrolled into college  and found a nice entry level job in a tech company that would hire me as an engineer when I finished school  Then my son s mother left and filed for support right away  They told me that because I had the  ability to earn   they based my support off of my highest income I had ever earned  in which happened to be 3 times what I was currently making  This made me unable to pay my bills  while she technically lived for free while making the same income as I was   and not to mention I have 40  custody   I literally had no choice but to drop out of college  quit my new job that I loved and go back to my old line of work  Except when I went back  I decided to start my own small trucking company and I just hope that if I continuously roll over my money by the end of each tax year into expenses  I can keep my income at  or below that threshold for the remainder of this court order   at least I hope  If not  I m going to lose everything I have worked for up to this point and my own retirement I have been building  Anyways  I watch your videos quite often and just saw this video pop up  figured I would share my experience as well  I hope all gets better for you in the near future my friend  Stay strong,118,11
I will never get married ,1,
 S Hossain the funny thing is that we weren t even married  Lol  But after this experience  I will never marry  That s for sure  And if I do for some reason  I m signing a prenuptial agreement and definitely no more kids lol,1,
 Resilient Endeavor good luck to you  I m from Romania and here if the custody is 50 50  nobody pays the other parent  It s pretty fair  If you lose custody you pay 25  of your income ,2,
I just wonder why bother marry after all these shitty laws just destroying a man mentally  economically   ,3,
 Ciprian Yeah  she basically said that she just started college and was working less so she needed more money  I told them the same and they hit me with the  ability to earn  lol  Plus she also filed for daycare expenses and I now pay 86  of our daycare costs and don t even use the babysitter because she isn t open when I need her  Which forces me to stay home with my son and have even less income because I can t afford to pay two full time sitters lol  It s a mess man  But I m building a case against it  I just need a full year in business with my new company and I m hiring a corporate family lawyer and going to fight it once more  Not going down without a fight ,8,
 Hansley Pluviose me too man    it s definitely a corrupt system the way it s set up  Maybe some day something will change but I don t have my hopes up tbh ,2,
Brutal,4,
it s sickening honestly  my son s mother is the same way  I wish we could fix the family court system to stop women from making children commodities ,10,
Jesus man  You have 40  custody and you are supposed to pay 25  of your highest ever income  That calculation is not fair ,11,
I ve been watching TechLead ever since he was fired from Facebook and this must be the most heartbreaking video I ve seen  I m really sorry man and thanks for educating us on this issue ,100,2
He s making a PILE of   from YT  best to learn from this and find a good lady next time ,2,
Well look at the bright side at least you re not a virgin  It will be tough if you are a 40 year old virgin ,1,0
First let me offer my heartfelt apologies  I know what immense pain these situations can bring  I m VERY glad I didn t hire an attorney and represented myself in my child custody   support cases    even when it was me vs the State of Colorado  I spent the better part of 5 years in the Court system but I never lost a single hearing  Went from a Court order restricting me from having any contact  to having sole physical custody   decision making  reversing all child support  then relocating 1600 miles from bio mom  then terminating her parental rights and finally step parent adoption  I know everyone will tell people in family court  You HAVE TO GET AN ATTORNEY    why  So you can spend all your money and still lose  Study up on your states rules   procedures  study case law and decimate your opposition with facts   evidence ,166,9
 Levi Beers So you adopted your step daughter  Nice  ,3,
I m in California can you give me some advice or tips  I want to be prepared  Where can I go study and inform myself on case laws  court procedures  and guidelines without having to take college courses ,1,
  Matt C see that s the difference  I wasn t trying to use the law to my advantage  I was saving my son from an awful situation and was able to articulate that with evidence to the Courts  They simply agreed with me    both male and female judges  Judge Jolene Grubb Kopriva of Blair County PA finally terminated parental rights to my son s biological mother and my  former step  daughter s biological father  in separate cases  weeks apart  and immediately followed with step parent adoptions  At one point during the whole process I even motioned to get specific CPS records under seal because they showed a clear   convincing history of child abuse  Won that too  to my own surprise ,15,
 Shafer Hart It didn t cost me anything monetary to self represent  If anything  I saved 50 60 thousand dollars  As far as time though  you re right  I spent countless hours upon countless days doing research  documenting and putting my case together   Was that worth 50k  To me  yeah ,26,
you think everyone has time and money to effectively get a second career as a lawyer  Not to mention that judges more often than not they look down on people representing themselves and punish them since judges used to be attorneys and part of the racket themselves  It s rare that people representing themselves win these cases  to the point that I doubt your tale but let s take you at face value for the sake of argument ,24,
two things I d never do  get married under any government law or have children if which I have zero interest  so of all the issues I may face in life neither of these two issues will ever affect me ,2,0
Sometimes you win the game by simply not playing  Sadly  nowadays getting married and having children as a man in a Western country is one game you will never win ,4,1
There s also nothing to win even if you play   It s a stupid game with only stupid prizes ,1,
Thank you for sharing this bitter reality   I m so sorry you went through this and God willing it wont get worse as time goes on   I appreciate you sharing the info on what really happens   Russ,13,0
5k a month wow  your child is going to have a nice  financial  life  the child support my mom got for me was between 400 and 500 bucks  My father stopped paying when I was in university  I now don t have a degree and am unemployed and eventhough my grades in my matura were good  minimum wage slave jobs     I was a doge millionaire but the exchange went broke and I didn t have a wallet back then  And looking at my portfolio I think 5 month to two years and I m a millionaire again  Maybe even one month   I get it that child support in USA and the legal system is a pain in the a     But as you said not being able to spend time with your child  that breaks your heart  I d recommend getting another child with another wife  though you might end up like Elon Musk  How many children does he have now  12  He s still a trillionair ,2,4
You think the child is going to be getting that money      ,1,
Maybe the volitility in your life is due to being from a broken family  Single mothers are the worst family situation to raise a child in  Your mother could have done a better job in choosing a father for her children  not just an atm,1,
Or the mom is going to squander it on a lavish apartment  fancy clothes and eating out    somehow women seem to think they are entitled to the money and not primarily the kid ,1,
Getting another child with another wife  Are you serious   If he even considers it he needs to do it outside the US and make sure he has 100  custody of the child ,4,
My daughter mother has done this to me for many years  As a father this hurts so much alot of father s can relate to this and it s really unfair how the court system treats us ,65,2
Time to take things into your own hands,4,
I have no idea how someone can get away with grabbing child support from another country   That s a whole new level of WTF in the legal system ,151,7
Will the child still needs to survive   it s not like he she is dead,1,
He could go to Japan and file for visitation  Japanese law would give the father custody if the mother doesn t comply ,6,
Somehow it is very popular in Japanese American marriages   I heard a lot of cases   The Japanese laws protects the Japanese women ,12,
The child was a citizen of the USA ,2,
Woman right  Man wrong ,50,
Well   I m not getting married  at least in the United States or the western world  and no kids in the west either ,1,0
You married a waiter from Japan  gave her a good life with all the luxuries  and this is how she repays you  The feminized west has guaranteed women all rights and no responsibilities ,2,0
Welcome to mgtow,2,0
1  Child support should be capped at enough to reimburse the custody parent half of basic expenses for the child such that both parents pay half the child s expenses 2  If child was abducted  then TechLead should pay nothing and full custody  or at least 50 50  3  Women should not be given special privileges  men demonized and abused by the system 4  This one is more controversial   I think the system is backwards   Whoever has custody should pay the child s expenses   If you can t afford it then the other parent should get custody ,80,4
Or women can be equal to men and go to jail if they are not able to financial support their children  Seems fair,22,
My brother got slaughter in the court lol   you should have listened and live the free agent lifestyle by coach greg adams ,1,0
RE  12 04    If your only problem is money  then you don t have a problem    That s what I told my wife about my gambling addiction ,1,0
his reaction is always so calm and smoothly transitioning to sponsors LOL,2,0
 Flem utter Exactly  Even if you don t want to do these things  having a cleaner and cook is still cheaper than  5k a month to pay an ex wife who doesn t provide you anything ,2,
He didn t say he makes millions a year  Being a millionaire and making a million a year are two different things  You can make  200k a year and be a millionaire after a few years  time ,1,
This is why we have walked away  The empathy free and predatory attitude towards men   We can live without you and kids in fact am getting used to it  7 years in  No wife  no strife  I can cook  clean  my homeboys provide company  I enjoy my hobbies  If hormones get to crazy I can rub one out,4,
through your sarcasm    this is the very truth about taking away that which you love the most     I too have my son taken and turned against me   much love bro ,1,0
Women know exactly what they are doing and they don t care  They d rather do bad by themselves than be with a man even if it benefits the child  They know EXACTLY what they re doing ,2,
Man    if you are not seething with rage    are you human ,1,0
I neeeeeeded to hear this  Writing a book right now on it ,1,0

not letting you see your son is a CRIME ,1,0
 I m never going to financially recover from this     Joe Exotic,5,0
I ll be your friend,1,0
you re the 4th person I ve heard of this happening to  Why don t you make something that reaches out to half Japanese 18  kids who don t know their parents and reconnect them later on in life ,5,1
What a simp    Yakuzaaaaa       hire them      ,2,0
feel your pain bro  it s so wrong ,4,0
I wonder why the marriage rate keeps on falling,2,0
Now I understand why these seemingly affluent white dad s either kill themselves or kill their entire family and bury their kids 10 miles outside the city borders  There is no more concentrated form of evil than child support,1,0
It sounds extremely painful  Maybe men should just start hiring surrogate mothers  Why deal with such extreme emotional and financial risk ,2,18
 Peter Nikolov You re very logical Peter  I appreciate the honesty and perspective  I agree having a child is very much like a project  Although you consider it a cop out I still blame society at large for filling the common mans head with idea of love instead of choosing a partner in life like a partner in business    Some solutions  1  Marry a woman who makes as much as you do or more and agree on a prenup in front of proper legal council and a judge so she can t claim coercion   2  Have a surrogate child children and hire nurses to help raise them   3  Marry a foreign woman who comes from a society that promotes traditional family values and remain in said country ,1,
 GearZNet    As for why things are so bad  I think the root cause may be men not embracing equality   splitting childcare and work equally with their partners as opposed to embracing gender roles which is what Tech Lead did ,1,
 GearZNet     Society  sounds like it is someone else s fault  though  My dilemma is what to tell my kids and what to tell myself  I am not too concerned about society  Smart people should pick the best option ,1,
Because society has fed men the narrative of   Love   In the pursuit of a woman that   loves me for who I am  men will sacrifice peace of mind  parental rights  and sometimes their lives ,1,
Dude  just don t pay it  She s in Japan  File charges for kidnapping against her ,1,0
I always wanted to marry a japanese woman   After watching this not anymore    ,7,0
Your ex wife must be a vile  unsufferable b ,2,0
Till he is 21  here in Canada  You have an obligation to pay for him  Regardless of the situation   Been through this myself well over  170 000 in child support  and you have no say in how the money is spent   Keep your chin up  and try to live your best life  My son is now an adult  and has no desire to get married after seeing what I have been through   The system is designed to keep men indebted  My ex restricted access even though  we had 50 50 custody   Try your best to keep contact with your son  Once my son became old enough he came to understand what has transpired  I have a fantastic relationship with my adult son  Stay strong for your son ,191,11
I hope that your calls out his mother for her evil actions  Disgusting state of so many of these Western women now ,1,
In most US states it is until age 18 or until college is finished  which you are obligated to pay for too  ,1,
 Made By Taylor Or end the judge and lawyers for allowing it to happen  If there is no justice on their end  there will be justice on my end ,7,
I d just fake my death at that point and move to Brazil or something,12,
HOLY WHAT THE FRACK      ,1,
Im paying  500  I feel you not really as a Non Millionaire,1,0
Its not  family  court  its a women s court designed to extract wealthy from men and destroy them ,1,0
This video makes me seriously consider getting a vasectomy ,5,1
  maaaaan Family Court is ruthless man and some of these women are straight EVIL  creatures  Karma will get your ex wife In the end Tech lead  mark my words  Stay strong my brotha  the manosphere and red pill community gots your back ,1,0
We need more women like you who are willing to comment  It really drives the point home that marriage and kids are a bad deal in the west ,3,
TechLead s breakdown of attorneys is so ruthless and brutal  Family court has got to be one of the most corrupt entities on the face of the earth  The documentary Divorce Corp should be pushed hard on all college age men  https   youtu be th0R2nxva2w,1,0
No one is pointing out the fact WHAT a child needs 5000 dollar for  500 dollar would have been totally sufficient to cover ALL his needs  This is just another indicator that it is not about the child but about f  ing the dad over and serving irresponsible women ONLY ,2,0
That s quite shocking  So the law incentivises women to divorce and then deprive their child of their fathers to maximize their income ,4,1
Redpill   ,2,0
Sounds mgtow is the best way    Welcome   ,2,0
Man that is so messed up  I didn t realize that in terms of child support it seems like an automatic guilty verdict to the father in these situations ,113,20
 Vaquera Soto of course you shift the goalpost to  but men do this   You say he s blaming women and then you turn around and start blaming men lmao,1,
Why does the court assume the mother will be a goof parent to the child do women ever have to prove themselves ,1,
 Vaquera Soto that s how ik ur a woman yall never take accountability,7,
 Vaquera Soto so it s the courts job to punish men and reward women for immoral bahvior right ,12,
 Vaquera Soto wait you didn t address anything I just said  You just keep saying it s mens fault  So are you saying that the woman abducting this man s son and forcing him to pay full child support while keeping his son from him is fair  And he should blame men for what happened to him instead of his ex wife ,14,
 General Ivan because that s where the problem originated  Instead of blaming women for these issues in court   put the blame at the real cause for these issues  men  If they would have taken responsibility and not have abandoned their wives and children  most men wouldn t be experiencing this in the court system today ,1,
Most women are to blame as a matter of fact  The law allows them to have this behaviour  therefore it is only natural that some would exploit the system in that way  That is not an excuse to blame men because you re just a mad feminist tho  No need to deny obvious things tho ,12,
 Vaquera Soto why should men now be blamed for what some men did in the past  Should the courts not be doing their jobs  What s the use of the court system if they are just going to let women take all the benefits no matter what ,18,
 Vaquera Soto True but the law has to adapt to individual cases  If not  whats it really for then ,10,
 Matt C you blaming women  sadly  I did some research on this years ago and if it wasn t for men walking out on their wives and children and abandoning them for their secretaries or younger women we wouldn t be seeing what we have in family law  Family law didn t even exist then and it had to be created to handle these cases  So  if you want to blame anyone for how the system is  blame the men and also no fault states ,1,
 Vaquera Soto they need to get rid of No Fault divorce  Except for adultery or real abuse  if you leave the marriage  you get nothing ,24,
OR the mother IF she makes more than he does  I ve seen it go both ways  I knew a woman who paid alimony to the ex husband ,5,
I m going through the experience myself  The courts automatically default to the mother and you really have to fight it out to be equal ,15,
i can literally felt his pain in his calm speech ,4,1
      ,1,
I went through  Child support twice  It mostly depends on where you live  Both States where I ve been automatically Gave the parental rights to the mother  Because I did not marry them  I had no rights  As  the father    I truly believe that the system is made to  Incentivize  Single  Mother households  They are allowed to receive Welfare  housing  Medicaid etc  But if I try to receive any type of government assistance I get denied    F    this world   But luckily I m like you all I need is coffee And gaming and I ll be OK ,67,1
Get a dog dude  Man s best friend ,1,0
I love hearing your stories Techlead and I m always heartbroken about you and your son  I m so sad to hear that your retirement didn t go as planned  I have no idea what is wrong with your ex wife    she is trying to ruin your life   ,33,1
As a law student  I can confirm that lawyers  not all  but many  do charge you to the roof when they see that you are wealthy  It s one of the ethics issues we are taught in law school    something that most lawyers disregard or self rationalize ,250,21
So basically act like a peasant when you meet any lawyer,1,
Business comes first  Every lawyer has a family to take care of too  It s dog eat dog  You family or theirs  You kids go hungry while their kids eat  Welcome to capitalism  Welcome to every thing you cared about have a dollar tag on it  Welcome to love that is mostly rented  but the landlord can keep jacking up the rent  Welcome to lost causes and stolen dreams  Sorry for all your losses  but you still won the lottery of life ,1,
 DaggerSecurity It seems to me that if ones thinks the judiciary system is actual justice then one s perception is corrupt  on the other hand if one sees it is not real justice and goes on to become a lawyer anyways then one is corrupt  either way whether one is doing it fully aware or fully deceived one is corrupt in one way or another   But also it generally seems to me that as far as I know  nobody walking this earth is a perfect saint   What else can we do but do our best to be righteous and bold against our sins   Lord have mercy on us ,5,
With all due respect the legal profession  lawyers specifically  is the profession with the least ethics and integrity   They get paid regardless of performance and there is no objective way for a client to verify if his lawyer is putting in the effort or not   I estimate that over 90  of lawyers are psychopaths or sociopaths   Is it any wonder why most politicians are lawyers before they become politicians ,22,
 io idt the US is run by lawyers China is run by engineer scientists etc  Watch the technicians win,7,
any discussion to change that practice  some law to protect the  consumers  ,6,
 Chief Enumclaw lmao,12,
That was a good comment  Peter  Please be sure to send Techlead an invoice for it ,46,
in a country founded by lawyers you know lawyers were always going to grant to themselves all kinds of ethical breaks for a quid or two ,31,
Women  What do you expect  We ve granted them same rights as men but never took into account they have minds of children ,1,0
Don t get married in the USA  Don t bring your wife to the USA  Don t have kids in the USA  I broke these rules and I paid for it  Heed my words fellas ,593,42
 George Gatusio thank you,1,
I came to the UK  to find out that I can t this big risks and to have a family  so man s live is pretty misarable there  but you can stay lonely there  I checked many countries and in EU they are almost all are the same in this way   taking your assets before marriage and split it   very wrong robbery  So for a man  to be on safe side  is better to move to other country where you property is your property and child support is not rediculuous ,3,
 TK Foo smart man ,1,
Agree  One of the top three things I didnt do it was I didnt get married with her  Otherwise I d be miserable like hell ,1,
 alexeymezenin Nothing works against child support  except obtaining half or full custody ,3,
100  correct  I learned my lesson  now im just like everyone else  Me me me me mine ,4,
Anywhere in the English speaking West  do not settle and marry anyone   I went through exactly the same predicament  it is fascinating that it was against the law to record or film the unjust proceedings   Maybe it should be allowed for analysis and evaluation ,4,
Child support is voluntary in every state  No such thing as court ordered child support  You got scammed ,1,
Japan doesnt have child support ,1,
 Ahmed Amer America is great for business and employment opportunity  maybe the best in the world  Education I m not so sure  Mating  One of the worst ,20,
Amen,1,
Use a surrogate,3,
 Ashhar Kausar hmm that is interesting  Sucks that you have to leave the biggest economy and market in the world  I tell you the USA really is the land of opportunity   but yeah can t have everything I guess,4,
This also happens in most countries of South America ,8,
Wise words ,2,
Wats your story,1,
I did it too   ,2,
A angel been watching over me have no kids 26yrs old came close to 1 but found out it was not mine thank God,18,
Same here in the UK  Is a worst country in the world to start a family if you are a millionaire ,25,
 Ahmed Amer You pretty much have to leave the US ,45,
sounds like naughty by nature,5,
Then do you live in USA but have kids and a wife in a different country  what kind of life would that be  Living in other countries have their other cons as well ,6,
You can never win  its only the lawyers who win in their bank accounts ,1,0
The system really is no joke  They really had one of my brothers paying child support to a woman for a child that was 100  in his custody  i e  she wasn t raising the child at all   I think he d still be paying to this day if our uncle wasn t a lawyer and represented him for free,279,13
System even has men paying for children that are not theirs,2,
 Life s A Beach The very same system in China is exactly opposite   She leaves with what she came in,9,
The system is a joke ,10,
Wtf   That is so dumb ,11,
That happens all the time  People have no idea,15,
That actually sounds like a friggin  joke,31,
Thank you for sharing this  wishing the best for your son ,1,1
That s why I ll never marry or have children  Wish you lots of strength brother  I went through that for 20 years ,49,5
 Mo naz   go pay for it  it s cheaper,2,
The Western feminist legal system needs to be changed ,5,0
Not to mention none of the money is gonna go to the kids  just straight to Prada  Gucci and Louis ,3,0
If I was you  I d move  You should probably  as a millionaire  have multiple passports and bank accounts  You could retire in the Phillipines and continue making millions in defi online  Especially if your an 8 figure earner  Jeeez man why stay in the US ,1,0
My biggest regret is wasting a single minute on the opposite sex  every girl I ve ever known  is no longer in my life and I wastefully sunk time into people I ll never see or talk to again  I gained nothing ,58,6
Nature  nurture and laws don t mix together well when things break apart ,2,
So true ,3,
Me to bro just spent over 10k on a girl because I thought it was my child just got out of my situation never again and I mean that,6,
NEVER  GET  MARRIED ,2,0
Make sure to leave negative Google and Yelp reviews on that law firm to warn others  Absolutely disgusting ,77,3
 Independence City Motoring Artificial is subjective to someone who doesn t understand the divorce machine   He married someone vindictive  petty  and entitled who will battle for trivial amounts  racking up the legal fees in responses   Probably misdirected hostility as he acknowledged she wasn t taking his  great offer ,2,
 Call of Duty Legend I m talking about the law firm artifically drumming up billable hours ,6,
that s all firms   lawyers bill out for hundreds per hour   My billable rate is around  650 an hour   If you got weak pockets  this isn t a game you want to play ,3,
I pay  1000 in CS every month  still living with my parents because of it  It sucks,48,3
Damn bro  hopefully you can recoup  these chicks be taking our pockets in court man ,1,
Sheesh   Head up brother  ,1,
That sucks man,14,
 5k a month is  60k a year  It does not cost ANYWHERE near  60k a year to raise a child  on average  in America  More anti male sexism from the sexist American court system ,1,0
The title should have been  How getting married ruined my life ,1,0
Hats what happens when you marry a western woman in California ,1,1
This sounds very similar to what has happened in my life and many others that I knew as well ,6,1
This is a very important message to every person  I recommend that everyone watch the movie  Divorce Corp  it will open your eyes and educate you on the divorce craziness  I went through a divorce that lasted over three years  my attorney which just starting her career as a divorce lawyer was horrified by the system and told me  this is insane and I will never get married   after over twenty years my retirement account is still frozen and will cost tens of thousands of dollars in attorney fees to get released  Only a moron would get married or someone who had something to financially to gain ,75,7
 tTommy Japan has a strict immigration law  He can t live there,2,
 Life s A Beach   Ironically he could have avoided all of this by moving to Japan since theirs s no child support laws in Japan domestically   She s using the California legal system even though she lives in Japan ,2,
Avoid lawyers they are not your friends,3,
The only winner in family court are the lawyers and usually the woman  Guys  please do not get married or get caught under de facto relationship laws ,4,
she told you that to assuage you as a client  It s very much in her interest to get married and  she will  find some sucker to get married to ,1,
Ya the whole thing is just huge racket ,6,
Your ex is harming your son by denying you in his life   She thinks  the boy will be fine    But she is blind and stupid   The boy will be bitter later in life   Don t be surprised if he decides to live with you later in his life   He will eventually probably want to live in the US   I do not understand how your wife could take your son to Japan   Usually you have to have a signed letter from the parent not traveling to take a kid out of the country ,29,2
She probably did so while they were still married and before Family Court entered the picture  Pretty clever of her  I ve experienced similar manipulations by my ex ,1,
Yep I see plain stupidity  Japan is so doomed 240  debt to GDP and their fed own 40  of their entire stock market ,2,
I am never going to have children  I am happy by myself  I dont care what people say  there is enough people in the world  I dont see the need to bring more ,36,9
 Black Jedi   No I do not  and honestly  my life has been nothing more than a panful hell that I don t talk about so yes  I would be better off not being here ,1,
 Black Jedi you speaking to the wrong generation bro   most of our responses would probably be yes ,3,
 Black Jedi   your a cog in the machine  There s other ways to leave a legacy  Children is women problem ,9,
I see your point and it is valid  But you were given life  and you have a moral obligation to pay it forward ,1,
Even is there weren t enough people  Why bring people into this suffering  Or increase the probability of your suffering into old age ,10,
Idk know about the laws out west but in Michigan  if your kid goes to college then you d still be obligated to pay child support until they either drop out or graduate up to the age of 21  So its crazy for real   ,6,0
The judicial system in the US really should be illegal the way it is  There s even a whole cartel of these bloodsuckers that specialize in finding women married to high earners and planting the seed of divorce to eventually suck as much money out of it as they can ,1,0
Spot on with your assessment brother  I was in Afghanistan before I even knew I had a child so I went home on mid tour leave and took care of all of the court stuff  The court system used all of my temporary pay that I got for being in an active combat zone and just fisted me   In my opinion you have the right mentality though  life goes on ,88,6
 Recep Yildiz I did the DNA test  she is mine,10,
Have you requested a DNA test  It could be somebody else s child too   ,9,
Did you get a court ordered paternity test  You should know your rights as a soldier in AR 608 9 ,13,
She dragged you through the dirt to get this far I know  but now anytime she slips you must repay the same respect she dragged you through ,2,1
I ve been down this road for 18 years    1  If you re paying child support you are 100  allowed to see you children  You now have a legal visitation right order in your hand stamped by a judge  and if she ever fails to abide by that court order all you have to do is call the police  they will issue a warrant for arrest and subpoena back to court for failure to abide by court ruling    In the long run you have the upper hand  If she doesn t show up with the kids as obligated by the courts  call the police    2  It s always best to represent yourself in family court  In regards to child support ,5,5
 HygroHybrid On paper yes  not in reality  The system will usually not punish women for that  Maybe yes in some cases but it will cost you a lot of time  energy and money  I have seen this around me  Few friends are fighting the system now  One of them didn t see his kid for 2 3 years ,1,
Not true   most places child support and legal visitation is two seperate things ,1,
doesn t work when she lives in Japan  police are going to show up there ,1,
 Legally you can win whatever you want  but if it leaves everyone just bitter and angry   I wouldn t consider that a victory necessarily   I love this part  All the best to you TechLead    I remember watching the video where you visit your son  it was touching  Hope you get to be with him again in the future ,312,8
 no further west we just wish him the best  I hope he achieves victory to be with his son ,1,
It s not a victory if you can t see your son  I would never accept that as an outcome  No way the mom can abduct my son and I have pay her  That s crazy ,1,
I ll tell you  what I d consider a victory   A victory is  when you get back to live with your child  with no restrictions   Either with or without the mother  She doesn t matter  If she is present  you must completely gain control of the relationship  otherwise things repeat  If she s not in the game  but children with you  then you should replace her by a better  more reliable  more feminine woman  This  and just this  would be a real victory ,1,
it is cheaper to renounce US citizenship get the Stonian one   then US child support wont be able to sue you and move to canarias island or another fiscal Paradise,1,0
The biggest reason why I choose to live a sexless life  as a 32 years old virgin  is because I don t want to deal with the consequences to sex  If you do the math  TechLead having to pay  5 000 per month for 15 years is  900 000  I would rather die a virgin than to have my life ruined by child support ,1,0
I feel for you   Father s get screwed in court   It is truly unfair ,22,2

God bless you man   we men need to do something about this  It s her fault not yours  Men make better parents per given the chance statistically  Women can t make it so difficult or impossible to be the father you would be havent it been for them wanting your money  They choose money over what is best for the children and that is the flaw of the corrupt court system along with them getting paid dollar for dollar what they order you to pay  We have to do something about this like seriously ,17,1
Damn TL nobody deserves this I hope you get through this man,10,0
This is pretty hard to hear  Don t get me wrong because children do need to be provided for  but 5k is pretty excessive  On top of that   that full amount doesn t even go to the other parent  The government takes a nice chunk out of it  There is a way to get out of it  but you have to dig deep to get the answers ,1,0
5k net cash is basically a job grossing 9 200 a month  Techland is 100  right  The court system is a mess  Your ex wife is a bucket of garbage  Stay strong ,2,0
This was a good wife for sure  She did her job well to steal from you  as more and more women do to be honest ,17,3
 tutu Ji well i ve some horror stories of mine  so no ,3,
Edited  TechLead earns  70 000 per month          5 000 is chump change   I pay  2500 of spousal support 16 years after the divorce   I have no income  it all comes out of rapidly declining savings    The courts are very broken ,3,0
She will never be appeased    Just walk away and live your life  Don t give the courts and her  a dime of your money and emotional capital ,2,1
5k a month is more than my paycheck  before paying rent  ,1,0
My man  little bit of advice  This is not going to destroy you  This is not going to hurt you  You can make money anytime you want you are a money making machine  Think of it this way you re blessed  that you re able to pay that and you live such a simple life that  you re young enough and wise enough and more than capable of handling this  One love ,2,2
A loss of a child will always affect you   i went through this and never fully recovered   regardless of the money ,2,

wow  no crypto BS just like the good ol days,1,0
The system is not rigged against anyone  If you are in the right  you can win    The way you could have won  1  Don t hire a lawyer  Lawyers are for the incompetent   You re smart enough to do pro se court filings   2  Undo the kidnapping   If you are supporting the child yourself  then there is no controversy  Without a controversy  there can be nothing to bring to a court ,2,2
 Boudica Slade The only reason the court has any jurisdiction  to do the opposite  as you say   is because he  as a millionaire  let the court have jurisdiction over the matter ,1,
Bro  set up what amounts to an annuity be it buying enough municipal bonds to pay the support  or a truly solid dividend paying stock that kicks off enough free cash to cover the support and the tax generated by the income needed   And forget about the hassle   Unfortunately  in your case  it looks like it is going to be like sequestering  2M to meet this obligation  but you ll get the principal back when the young man turns 18   Sorry this happened to you ,1,0
Earning  70k per month   Lucky child support is only  5k per month  then,2,3

He earns  70 k a month        wow  I missed that part   You are right on ,1,
And we wonder why dads aren t in the house    There are two sides to a story  Paying that much RUINS a man  So he gives up because lots of times  he goes homeless ,161,11
No lie  the women and courts be brutal ,3,
 Spenser I was being sarcastic ,1,
 Boudica Slade I agree with you that s it s just a few dollars for him but it s immoral the same way  He s not an ATM and the kid is not a product ,14,
no way he makes 70k a month lmao  u dont add in that he has alot of stuff to pay and 5k is a lot,7,
I definitely won t have kids under this family court system  Hopefully  for the younger men  the technology will advance and will invent how to have kids without needing a woman for that  Even if you pay  20k to have a kid without a woman and then you pay nannies you will be much better off than dealing with the corrupted court system  And nobody will be able to take the kid away from you ,14,
 Boudica Slade but it ruined his retirement plans  He s going to have to work till age 50 now instead of 48  That s 2 years of his life ,23,
TechLead seems to earn  70 000 per month  If that is correct then the  5k is chump change ,8,
Just don t pay    Fight  for  your kid  Sur her for  leaving her  some do this in porpuse and go do this to other men  ,1,0
No offense but if your make 70k a month  you can afford 5k a month of it on childsupport  But what they need to do is make sure that the money actually gets spent on your kid,1,1
Obviously it does not cost  5 000 a month to raise a child   I am surprised she did not get the money sooner   I am surprised he got off so cheap ,3,
I can resonate to  how do I know that what you offer is the fair amount   So for anyone outthere going on a date thinking about being generous buying one thing or the other    add x1 000 or x10 000 to that and imagine paying that on a 6 months or yearly basis forever  That s the amount you re looking at to commit when you go on date  Still thinking you re good    Guess what  you ll get the response   that s not the fair amount I m owed for the trouble you ve caused in my life   Now enjoy dating ,1,1
When I was going through my divorce  I offered to give my ex literally all our assets  about 30k   She wanted alimony too  so I had to hire a lawyer  then she had to hire a lawyer  then combined we paid the lawyers about 50k  She got a little alimony but not nearly enough to pay her half of the legal bills  lol,2,
The worst mistake of my life was getting married  Now a divorced father of two and homeless ,1,0
The best video in a long time  really enjoyed it  I am also divorced and have a daughter who grow up in another country  its tough life man  Getting a relation with your son is vital for you to have a life worth living  no matter the price  A weekly video call every Sunday can be a way to build up something  and later you can go to Japan to see him   Be generous on his birthday  and the holidays  as he grows up it will always be a warm memory about dad  I hope your ex wife unblock you  and the anger turns into working together   ,63,3
 97LORn He mention that his son was the most important in his life when they lived together  Then its obvious having a relation with him is very important ,7,
When we have a prejudiced mind  we can say  Getting a relation with your son is vital for you to have a life worth living  no matter the price   When we have a mind without any kind of preconceptions we can say   life worth living  no matter our circumstances  ,3,

Just because you make  70k month  you have to pay  5k per month for child support  Wow  So your being rich means you have to feed your child  your ex wife  and two of her new boyfriends  America is great ,14,4
 Amy Umm no  I personally don t plan on giving my son a lavish lifestyle  because they won t have any sense of urgency if you spoil them  And women are statistically and biologically incapable of disciplining their children at an older age  so giving her 5k will only make matters worse  Men need to learn how to be leaders  study psychology so you can strategically influence your family towards the right direction  Nowadays  a lot of men are emotional and woman are incapable of respecting emotional men,4,

Two Questions  1  Did you have to pay for your ex wife s attorney fees  2  Why did the child support case take place now  if your son was taken around 3 years ago ,12,5
It took her 3 yes cuz the court system is slow when it wants to be  Don t worry  hell have to pay the last three years as a lump sum or they ll add it to his monthly a little at a time  She ll get that money come hell or high water,1,
2  Sounds like his ex wife just now decided to pursue child support  Don t know why she wouldn t have before ,3,
If he s a millionaire he absolutely would have to pay for ex wife s attorney so she has no incentive to reduce the costs    The child support case is taking place now because TechLead didn t do anything about it and she was building a case for sole custody as he wasn t involved in the child s life ,6,
