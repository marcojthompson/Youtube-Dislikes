I am sort of new to the crypto space and I was wondering if day trading crypto is a viable option for passive income in the crypto space  I find the concept of leverage in crypto fascinating  125x leverage is quite tempting     Are there any consistent strategies out there  Can anyone share any consistent startegy with me if any ,25,8
I can confirm that day trading crypto doesn t work at least not in my case  I conducted an experiment with  1000 and lost almost 50  of my margin and the price wasn t even going down  Maybe it s just me being stupid and not figuring out how it works but I would say it s essentially gambling ,1,

Bitcoin recent price action shows evidence that a bottom may be forming   denying bears any further movement lower  Ethereum price has developed a ridiculously extended hidden bullish divergence condition on its weekly chart  warning of an imminent bullish reversal  XRP price hammered with two major short setups  but sellers failed to push XRP lower  At this point Diamond hands are showing cracks as people start to panic  if you are losing in the current dip or you look forward to start the best way to go is trading with the guidance of an expert  Ray F Johnson has been one step ahead of other analysis  with her strategy I have made over 23 btc in 3weeks   ,4,5

Haven t even watched the video  not even gonna watch it  Just wanted to mention that you make yourself look like a fool with these thumbnails and  urgent  titles  Everyone wants to make money in this life  I guess some are just more desperate than others  I don  t think anyone serious about crypto investments takes lessons from youtube influencers  If you wanna invest in something  go take some time and learn what you are going to do and where you are going to put your hard work money  It s not rocketscience  You can do it  Slow and steady wins the race  No one wants you to make it more than you do  All others are  just here to see their own benefit ,1,2

 Great info and insight as always It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC  A lot has changed and that s on everything but the truth is I don t even care much about bullish or bearish market anymore because David Roland  got me covered as I have made over 22btc from nov till date  His trading skills are exceptional   ,3,4

This aged like milk  Please make more investment predictions  I will try to inverse it   Shorting million token would also be a good idea ,2,2
last video was to buy wth mate  ,1,1
Ok  I ll start selling my Million Token now  As for all my crypto port  Million Token seems to have lowest number of developer working on it   The point he made is actually a good one  but note his bias  Check how crypto projects do compare to his idea  He s just a guy  He makes mistake  He has terrible judgement on something  and reliable skill on some  If you re holding crypto for value  I m sure you d know the risk of investing on Ethereum alternatives  Like  there re gonna be big one and failed one  If you re in there to trade  you know you gonna be quick on your feet and number of devs aren t gonna cut it for you   If anything  I think the devs aren t that familiar with traders  and investors  Why do you think the likes of Blizzard  EA  and those game devs literally destroy their IPs  Investors demand yield and returns and they can be toxic  It s not exceptionally toxic on web3 space  as far as I see it  It s normal trading floor  Jackarse walk the floor  what do you expect  They re there to capitalize on people s sentiment and want to be the winner on the debt body of their peers  This is trading world  buddy devs  This is why you dev and let the CEO deal with investors  You think your CEO is crazy  Well  we deal with these gitz all the time  So  better do what you do best and don t take them too seriously ,3,0
Great video really  Also i agree with your opinion  For the newbie if you are actually trading in the crypto space and you don t have a sound mentor  Then you are certainly going to get liquidated in 90  of your trades   Yeah that s the sad truth  For a start you need a good and experienced hand to guide you  Trust me  trading isn t difficult as we see it  With the right Signals and guide  you can earn hugely monthly ,192,9
So based on your last 5 crypto videos and how much they completely contradict each other I think it s safe to say that your opinions can be completely disregarded ,2,0
I HAVE INCURRED SOME MUCH LOSSES TRADING ON MY OWN   I TRADE WELL ON DEMO BUT I THINK THE REAL MARKET IS MANIPULATED    CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT I M DOING WRONG  ,3,1

Then what is the point of investing if you never see a return   You re just giving your money up for other people s profit   I thought the whole idea was to get rich not get poor    ,1,
Buying Cryptocurrency doesn t make you a winner  but the ability to make profit daily out of your capital is what makes you a winner  Stop depending on market price to make profit  choose trading over holding ,83,28

According to me or historical data BTC falls heavily after every halving s year  So this year will be bearish for btc  Next thing is to understand that s crypto market runs by whales  institutions and governments and if btc goes to  100k from around  50k that s will be only 2x but if btc falls to  20k and go to  100k that will be around 5x  So this year will be full of dip so keep usdt in hand to buy in dip  My journey as a trader was not funny at the beginning simply because I was so inexperienced and clueless till I got introduced to a very great trader THE NAME ABOVE  And ever since my journey so far as been the smoothest ,8,0

Good job mate lately when asked for predictions about bitcoin and cryptos generally  most experts on youtube and other media  predictions are mostly generic with no specifics on the direction  Everyone seems to be guessing and getting even more confused about the future  The only constant thing I can say for sure is that the traders are actually earning good returns while holders are always concerned about what the future holds for bitcoin or if there is even a future at all  With the insight  skills and experience of a trader like Jason Noah the sky is the limit despite the unstableness of btc  all thanks to Jason Noah who taught me how to make trade and increased my portfolio  from 3 to 17BTC now  No one really knows what is going to happen in the market  and I know people only say what they think will happen based on the past  It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own Investment choices based on their own research Say hello to Jason Noah  for a fix on  eI    m   JASONCOIN01 ,32,3

As we are in the month of March and I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in race in general or probably just naive  the sphere have  seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  i d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding   Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 2 BTC when I started at 1 5 BTC in just a few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from David Mayor I would advise y all to trade your asset rather than hold for a  future you aren t sure about or hold it and risk losing all     ,5,7

I don t have any fantom  just to say  But this morning it is down 24 8  24hr  which doesn t distinguish it from a lot of other tokens  People who get into crypto soon learn not to be quick to pop open the champagne when things are up or run around like their hair s on fire when things are down  There are good tokens that are a lot more down this morning   e g  Magic  which is 36 2   I don t  hold that  either  by the way  tho am watching it  and some good ones that are up  Butterfly  I hold a small bit of this  up 51 8   ImmutableX  don t hold but like  43 3    So it looks rather like business as usual in this volatile world  Speaking of which  I don t know about the other people out there but where are the safe havens for our crypto money to go to at the moment  Most people are going to just keep a bit of money in crypto  maybe a bit in precious metals  maybe a bit in cash in case everything goes down  Governments around the world are teetering on the brink  not even government bonds look reliable  anything could happen  So some might see this and sell their crypto but I think most of us will think  and do what         That said  thanks for the info about Fantom  first I d heard of it  I ve noticed how hot headed crypto people are on e g  the discords  I think a lot of a them are young and or desperate for money and or half mad from playing violent computer games  Can t be fun to be on the wrong side of their tantrums and there s a distinct lack of appreciation for what these dedicated teams of devs  often small and without much funding  are doing to build their crypto projects  They do not owe us a living and we need to appreciate them more and thank our lucky stars when things do go right ,1,0

Seems like a well thought post  and I see where you are coming from  It s a shame when people invest in projects mainly based on the influence a dev may have  That whole Wonderland and associated projects drama was simply built on the charisma and populist rhetoric of one man  Even as the project imploded  and it was clear manipulation took place  people ignored the deception in favor of blind optimism which in the end saw many users lose most of their assets  It s akin to a cult mentality  and virtual nation building   Andre was a great asset to the FTM community  a true innovator  but just as you saw when reading his posts  the guy seemed tortured and took things very personal  but not for nothing  it s not like he didn t fan a few flames via social media now and again   The one thing we are missing a bit is the value of a chain like FTM as a whole  When folks began to panic sell congestion on the chain soared  I watched in real time as the chain was  stress tested  Seeing roughly 1024 txns coming in per second  and the chain processing and validating about 65 transactions per second  and that s with only 22 operating nodes  Currently to run your own node validator it costs 500 000 ftm  that s a number that will drastically change soon as the network grows  and I can see a node explosion  That aline is  incredible and it s only scratching the surface of what s under the hood  In comparison  fully chugging away BTC can handle about 7 transactions per second  Ethereum about 15 per second  it s no wonder BTC is though of as not friendly to the environment  in early December a town near me in NY actually lost power as a mining operation sucked up so much energy  the grid couldn t handle it   In the end BTC can be looked at as just a coin  like a digital golden nugget  Chains like FTM though are flourishing with innovative project sets fueling the rise in De Fi and incredible protocols providing users with financial tools never seen before and accessible to anyone willing to learn the ins and outs of this defi world fueling a financial revolution   Yikes  got a little wordy here  thanks for your unbiased videos  and balanced approach  In the end defi  or Fantom is better represented by the technology it offers  not by  one person that used the underlying chain to code  innovate  and create De Fi projects  There s plenty of talent in the dev space  so many innovators  most choose to not take combative stances against the community they serve,3,0

Hi  Every 4 years the Litecoin mining reward is cut in half for miners  This reduces the the amount of new Litecoin being introduced onto the market which tends to increase price   In the run up to the 2015 and 2019 reward halvings the Litecoin price rose 5 6 X before people took profits  I would expect that to happen again in the 9 months or so leading up to the 2023 Litecoin halving   Bitcoin halving follows 2024 ,2,

Question  How can a cryptocurrency survive a zero day exploit of a hash function crack   Though mathematically improbable  it is still theoretically POSSIBLE to crack Bitcoin   Can anyone tell me how a potential crack of a hashing function could be identified and patched in a manner that it does not permanently debase the currency ,1,14
 Idrissa Thiam The miners would have to reach consensus  which I think is 95  and that would take some amount of time  but all they would have to do is agree to roll the chain back to that block  and I m not an expert but yes there would probably be unprocessed transactions in the affected block on the old chain   ,1,
 Idrissa Thiam that is impossible to say as it would depend on a number of factors  1  how soon the hack is discovered  the sooner the less transactions affected   2  how long does it take to reach consensus to fork the network after the patch  sometimes it can take a long time for miners to agree  but for something that isn t controversial and as urgent as this  I imagine it would happen pretty fast   3  how is the resolution implemented  do they revert all blocks after the hack and restart from there  do they keep the blocks but only revert certain transactions  very hard to say as it would depend on the type of hack    In any case it wouldn t be the best situation to be in  price would probably tank short term from the speculation   but it would be recoverable ,1,
By  debase  I guess you mean somehow create more bitcoins either by double spending or steal them by beating miners to the block reward or some other magic  It would be treated the same way upgrades and bugs have been addressed in the past  by miners forking or rolling back the chain and applying the patch  For example  lets say you figured out how to double spend on block 0004  this would not go unnoticed  The miners could simply fork the network with consensus from block 0003  and keep mining that patched chain  and let the old one  with the invalid transactions  die ,1,

I m new to crypto but one thing I noticed is no matter what projects tokens have going they seem to follow bitcoin  So if bitcoin is down or up then 95  of the other cryptos are doing the same thing  So even if there s news going on with crypto projects it doesn t seem to matter because they just follow bitcoin anyways  I know I m a newbie and don t know what I m talking about but that s my observation ,2,2
The struggles that befall crypto today are the struggles that every revolution has in the beginning  Continuing to push forward our ideals on decentralization  uncensorship and in general digital money  not all centralized exchanges are all bad  WILL lead to positive results as more and more young people start to incorporate its uses in their daily lives ,67,6

Andre Cronje just sounds like a typical software dev who s good at coding but terrible dealing with people or PR  Probably also goes on twitter a little too much lol  He has this idea of how people should behave and use his product  but it ll never work out especially when it comes to a huge project like this ,12,1

Have the  top developers  been forced out   They are leaving     Interpretation 1   believe them  there is no future in the crypto space   Interpretation 2   they were bringing bad energy to the space and got found out and forced out       AND    human problem solving is what will bring down tech projects   Tech problems are easy to solve in comparison ,3,0

I ve noticed the hostility  greed  and dishonesty in crypto  However  Andre s description is very similar to most financial industry jobs   businesses  That s the nature of money  I m sure he s made millions to compensate for such a intense environment  He needs to get a copy of Wallstreet or Boiler Room ,2,0

Quitting crypto in this case means retiring in filth rich style,5,0
So as ex tech lead in google  when you quit  did that mean google is bad ,61,7
Exactly  Awesome question,1,
This is not the nuanced question you think it is  Yes  Google IS bad ,2,

Seriously Tech Lead    I get your frustration but really   I have followed you for a while  mostly good but to think that 1 unpredictable Developer downing tools has got you in the abandon ship mode is BAD as many on Fantom are locked in Immutable smart contracts with a whole  loyal  team  40   to service and increase business   support them 1st,15,1
And you haven t found out that he likes to short crypto  It s great drama  And it keeps the downwards pressure    ,2,
Lesson One  Make sure there are enough monetary incentives for you too as the developer  Lesson Two  Don t deploy on Ethereum as it is ridiculously expensive  Lesson Three   Don t soil your diaper  especially in a public and profane way   It is a bad look ,34,6
Love your work Tech Lead but just to enlighten you  ALL those projects are going to be maintained by their developers are immutable smart contracts that don t require direct involvement with the exception of Solidly which has been claimed and will be taken over by Solidex  Now is probably a very good time to BUY  especially FTM  provided macroeconomic uncertainty is cleared up ,16,0

I think you re in a weird place in your life right now TechLead   You re all over the place with information  You re like that guy that has the 1 minute candle chart up and as soon as you see a red candle you sell your position because you don t have the knowledge of drawdown before gains  I don t know  you just seem off man ,9,4

This is very bullish for btc   eth  there will be many protocols that come and go this is not surprising  a lot of projects don t solve real problems and are community based that s why you need to look at real projects like luna  crv  btc  eth  dot ,4,1
You re very boring these days  and repetitive,1,1
Your double standards are something that even the democrats can t grasp ,4,1
How you are simultaneously pushing people away from crypto and defi and selling a course on crypto and defi is beyond me,49,8

Crypto is in a major buy zone but if you feel like you need to completely get out then do what you feel is right I guess,5,2
Kind of proves that sooo many of these coins were useless to begin with   not all but most ,1,1
 I respect your work mate    TA Is all well and good but i find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as It seems  It s kinda Irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC  We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps  narrowly avoiding a long term bear market  This is the worst possible time in history to Invest as so many don t back up their crypto assets   More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it Is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market  I have made over 11 btc from day tradng with Wim Steven  Insights and signals in less than 2 weeks  this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish  ,44,9

 Blake George  My first investment with Mr Michael Williams gave me the assurance that has made me invest without the fear of losing  I got four of my friends involved with him already,1,
 hendrick brown Thank you so much I just contacted him,1,
Last week s was the shittiest advice in the history of Techlead ,1,
Hhhhhhhhhhh he is totally protected hhhhhhhhhhh,1,
Seriously well said ,1,
Bro the titles are click bait  then he voices his opinion based on the facts that he represents to us  What you do with another person s opinion based on their so called facts  Without yourself doing research  Then you are to blame if you loose money not him  He is literally just being him ,3,
He said buy Bitcoin  Sell crypto  Pay attention,3,
He s trading the weekly chart guys  It s quite lucrative and he s timing the tops ,1,
To be fair to him  for traders  last week buy this week sell is pretty much the usual  isn t it  I don t trade myself but they re making money on margins so getting out and back in again at the right times is pretty much the job  as I understand it  Just saying   let s not jump on TechLead in precisely the way the crypto project guys are saying is so hard for them to handle  He might quit  too  and we don t want that ,3,
You missed  As a millionaire         Bro no one knows where the hell the Bitcoin is gonna be  He is just giving and advice you are free of taking it or not ,1,
OMG U R BLIND  LAST WEEK BUY BITCOIN  THIS WEEK SELL SHTCOINS,3,
Nothing is certain right now in any market   Only listen to yourself and update and trust your strategy and stick to it ,2,
Yeah  don t listen to this guy  Crypto is the future regardless of what is happening  The stock market is down  so crypto is down  Blame the war ,3,
buy high sell low strategy i suppose,2,
Lmao this comment is exposing the exact type of people being talked about in the video   the entitled  bratty community making the crypto and defi space hard for developers to deal with,5,
As a millionaire,2,
This is what all these YouTubers do so what ever happens market goes up market goes down they are right and we SHOULD OF LISTEN TO THEM  LOL,3,
    ,1,
He said in the previous video to buy bitcoin  and gave legitemate reasons why it s value may increase drastically in the future  And in this video he never said bitcoin was declining  On the contrary  he said that bitcoin was the only crypto which was safe  Did you even watch this ,13,
You act like the market doesn t change  rapidly ,1,
That s what they all do  Mr whale,1,
BTC  only buy  never sell ,7,
He did both in this video alone  He pushes his crypto class while telling us to sell all      lol,4,
 Jaden uhl i agree,1,
And now you discovered DYOR   DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ,5,
Dude you are totally contradicting yourself,5,
Pretty sure he said  Buy BTC  last week  Now he s saying  sell Crypto     know the difference,13,
Yep always right  but never advise  ,2,
    ,1,
Well  I assume you should have bought last week and should sell it now  Crypto can change a lot in one day,10,
Agree  in 1 week ,4,
