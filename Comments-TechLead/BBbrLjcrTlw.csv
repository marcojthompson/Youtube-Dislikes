I think people including me do read newspapers or learn new things for fun  preventing dementia  and stress relief not for productivity  I don t like seeing people being obsessed with business  money  From my experience  money is worth but not so much ,1,0

Videos like this show why TechLead is my favorite comedian  There is the  what s the deal with peanuts  comics  the vulgar and sex comics  the  you might be a redneck  comics  the political comics  why is orange man so orange etc   and then there s TechLead who is teaching you and then you think back on it later in the day he was actually trolling you  Bravo  TechLead      as someone who   well  I got nothing done today ,1,0

The secret to productivity is to walk a standard job and invest in stocks in this way you are both getting a regular salary and you are an owner of many companies the best of both worlds,1,1
well said brother,1,1
What I like from TechLead is he tells you the reality without giving af  bout your feelings ,1,0
You see the productivity only from money point of view  but for other people productivity means feeling  experience and other type of stuff that you didn t spoke about  Have your productivity as you want  Please  be less abstract to push value in other young people ,1,0

But then when you start becoming over confident and calling your followers and viewers  unproductive slobs  aka  consumers  for    watching you and ensuring you re monetized and rewarded as the   producer  then it s high time we abandon your channel  This is disrespectful without regulating utterance guage     adios amigos ,1,0

Learning more does not change our life  It s knowing what we want  taking immediate massive consistent action  notice what we re getting from our actions  and keep changing our approach until we do get what we want ,7,1

Wow you ve got some great observations  It s so true that learning for learning itself leads to no success  Learning is more than required  but ONLY as part of means that lead you towards your goal vision  Analysis paralysis is real and it s crucial to wake up from it asap ,19,0

Love the old tech lead feel to this,1,1
comes off condescending  productivity doesn t always  happiness  i can have peak experiences reading fiction that out performs you coding some bs crypto you think is so great  PS isnt not and you just the same as everyone else sure you might have a high iq and some fancy resume but you dont seem happy to me,1,0
I feel like you were speaking to me through this video  Thank you Tech Lead  Enough reading  execution time now ,4,0
Couldn t agree more  Stop reading about people and start executing people ,1,0
Nailed it  Honestly though   Be a producer  not a consumer ,7,0
TechLead is probably preaching to someone toxic who thinks they are productive by just acquiring random information   But this is the truth  Acquiring information to do nothing is really not productive  But doing something and then acquiring information in an unrelated field can give you more ideas  So  overdoing the acquiring of information is not good ,1,0

I advise y all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses The market is very unstable and you can t tell if it s going bearish or bullish While myself and others are trad n without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket  It all depends on the pattern you follow  I was able to make 13 BTC from 2 1 BTC in just July from implementing trades with tips and info from Elizabeth Rhodes,18,12
I am really grateful to Elizabeth Rhodes  I invested a capital of  2000 and I got a profit of  8000 because of her  She really helped me gain financial stability and I have gotten profit of over  20 000 through  Elizabeth Rhodes ,2,
Bitcoin is the safest crypto for investors right now  Couldn t agree more about tradng the asset too ,1,
Lizafort,1,
Elizabeth Rhodes  really knows her way around trading  its evident from her deep knowledge of how the market works  reading signals to perfection  i feel very safe trading with her ,1,
Simple step by step process  excellent communication and response times  The service was extremely streamlined and friendly throughout  Would recommend them to anyone give Elizabeth Rhodes a try ,1,
You ve mastered the art of dry humor,1,1
I like your life talks just about topics on relationships and things that are important in life ,4,1
What you say is mostly true and very practical   executing tasks leading to goal is the most valuable activity    But there is a hidden benefit of learning something new  you are training your mind  you will be able to learn new things  new concepts faster   ,2,1
Exploration vs Exploitation,1,1
Thanks for sharing the viewpoint on bugs in code  There s a tiny bit of shortcoming  OK  maybe someone is wasting their time by fixing a bug  However  please advise  why would the company pay monthly salary for someone working on fixes  Second question  in some industries like finance  bugs can be there in essencial reports and actually a report may not be generated in the first place due to bugs  So I can only agree with you  sometimes there s a bug and management may not allow you to fix it  Sometimes quite the opposite happens  something annoying can be considered a bug  And if nobody wants to teach and learn about linked list  it would be a good idea to reinvent the wheel ,1,2
I want robots  computers  time and money working for me  I call it taking action from a state of being ,1,1
This whole video killed my productivity  TDLR  Don t read for pleasure  its meaningless   nevermind that people actually enjoy reading for leisure  Techlead use to have great content  now he just goes on rants instead of constructing anything worthwhile  Humans aren t robots man  if we used logic instead of emotion  we wouldn t be buying your bs crypto meme shill coin ,2,1
Can someone explain how does the MM staking works  Because isn t the token caped so where is the 20  return coming from ,1,1
In all seriousness  I always get confused by the  start your own business because jobs are BS that society deceives you into believing  argument  Isnt a business really still just a job  And even if its entirely different somehow  arent you still just contributing to the same  lying society  when you give employment to others ,2,2
Work is work  but presumably when you start your own business you ll do work that you love because you chose that  Also because this work is of your own creation you ll feel a sense of fulfillment and pride you can t get squashing bugs for the  man   It s your baby and we tend to love what we create  As for employing others  it s not your role to provide them with a fulfilling life  That can only come through self realisation  and who is to judge who is further along that path ,2,

I m now a millionaire and then some via being very productive and investing in an agile fashion    Also made plenty of sacrifices   Now I have passive income which is the absolute zenith    I never wanted to own the world like most narcissistic sociopaths   The key is to be CONTENT    Let the other sheep tread on each other for their pieces of silver   Most prole fools buy  hit they don t need with money they haven t got to impress people they don t know   Fail  However if UN2030 does come about you may as well not even bother because your  and my  future is entirely fkd ,1,1
Thank you for this video  TechLead  I often feel guilty for not reading many books a year  now I know to feel guilty for nerdy posturing as learned instead  My Dad was an old school engineer and he would have loved this ,4,1
To be fair  watching your videos is highly productive,1,1
This is peak INTJ mindset  Get a goal  learn what you need  discard the rest  accomplish goal  continue   INTPs on the other hand like to learn for the sake of learning   or we are just procrastinating lol   But yeah  solid points  Liked ,7,2
lolol you actually believe in that rubbish ,1,
This actually a great damn video  If I disagree with something is books  I believe that books are really good  you just got to put what you learn into practice ,1,1
Look at tech lead getting into real estate  he s going to put his house in his parents back yard AND earn passive income on the affiliate link  as a millionaire  what a genius ,1,1

You hilarious TechLead   Youre right though about productivity  they cant laugh at you man youre living good ,14,4
The pursuit of money is not everyone s goal  The question  What is success   has many different answers depending upon who you are asking  We live in an age of hysteria when it comes to money and success  For some  success is reading a book they ve always wanted to read  Maybe 10 books  For others it might be learning a new craft  or perhaps learning to play piano  For others it is purely financial  I think what we need to focus on is to pursue what is meaningful  and to pursue happiness  The pursuit of money alone is more often than not  meaningless  and is no guarantee of happiness ,42,9
Money let s you do whatever you want whenever you want,1,
 Tertioptus You can read books and learn to play piano without obsessive desire to make money  These are not  spoils   Obviously we all need to do something with our lives to sustain our general cost of living  but the pursuit of money is not a measure of productivity or of success  Pursue what is meaningful,1,
reading 10 books  learning piano  etc   is not sustainable without someone s  marketable  productivity   Those things are the spoils of success   No need to bring up those who are obsessed with money  when general societal responsibility should be considered ,2,
I d say someone who has 87 kids is pretty successful at  something  ,1,
True that but that does not negate his point  Trying to be productive and to prioritize the things that get you to a point where you re happier with your life is applicable on all sorts of things,7,

Good Content you just earned my SUB  As a broke person ,1,1
Ok  this is solid advice  Even when you create new things as a software developer  if you do as part of a day job at a company  20  of the time is spent writing 80  of the code  the architectural design and building classes  data models  the fun stuff  and 80  of the time is spent fixing bugs in a small number of lines  or adding meaningless features that anyone could make   How do we avoid the 80  meaningless phase  stay in the 20  productive phase  and be able to apply your knowledge in more practical ways while still writing code and getting a paycheck  I enjoy writing code  so I don t want to become a people manager  at least not yet  Is the answer consulting  Contracting  What is the name of this and how do you find it and get into it if you re good at creating solutions  not just code  I want to be able to use what I ve learned and use my critical thinking abilities to solve new and unique problems  even ones I don t know about  while I m still young and my brain is still working well,2,1
Thanks for the wakeup call TechLead ,1,1
Blind leading the blind        Google is always going to know more    ,1,1
Lmaooo this video is a gem,1,1
I always looked up to you  Always take your advice and managed to accomplished plenty at this point  However you seem so lonely  It saddens me  Reminds me i ve been so blind about chasing success  I cut off relationships with people  Maybe need to backtrack a bit and fix any damage I may have caused to my social life  Anyways  keep it up dude  Always here  always watching ,19,5
Behind all the sarcasm maybe he s not that funny nor happy  I respect him but he is playing with fire here on youtube,4,
It s lonely at the top,5,
Interesting perspective   Behind the sarcasm there are always good takeaways from your videos ,55,1
I was so crushed by the reality of my inferiority to TechLead that cried like a baby in front of my loving wife and kids  They don t respect me anymore and only watch TechLead videos now  They ve gone and abandoned me on their routes to success making 100x my current wage slave salary  Thanks  TechLead ,234,4

Exactly  I am tired of seeing all these YouTube videos on  how to be productive    how to read 10 books a week   etc ,8,1
Productivity is a measure of how much output one can produce  nothing about how meaningful the output is  The correct definition would be   how much of meaningful output one can produce in a given time period ,1,1
Respect the tech lead because he deserves respect,4,1
Thank you for the wise words and everything you do for the MM community,25,1

Be 100  more productive by  1  Cut your to do list in half  2  Take more breaks  3  Follow the 80 20 rule  4  Use your morning to focus on yourself  5  Tackle your challenging tasks before lunch  6  Improve your email etiquette  7  Create a system  8  Stop confusing productivity with laziness  9  Stop multi tasking  10  Cut your to do list in half  Do less  not more ,78,5
I completely disagree  It literally took me 5 minutes max to type those bullet points so it didn t take any time away from my productivity  I was watching a Youtube video which means that I was not being productive at that time anyway  And I purposely repeated the same point twice emphasizing that we should focus on doing less and getting things done instead of keep on adding and staying behind with tasks  Those points have totally helped my case as a Senior Software Engineer and have made me much more productive than I used to be ,3,
its unproductive to write 10 bullet points and 2 of them are the same  I guess you want them to be 10   but that it is not an efficient use of your time   P S      4 and 5 contradict each other  8 makes no sense as no one thinks productivity means being lazy  10 is a literal copy of 1   Yes i literally copy and paste this from another comment becasue i thought if you read it twice you ll understand you are wrong ,3,
First 4 points are game changers  Especially the 80 20 rule ,1,
Writing a long list is not productive nor my attempt to answer you     Definitely not productive     ,5,
Techlead  I will not live in a pod  Or eat bugs   ,1,1
