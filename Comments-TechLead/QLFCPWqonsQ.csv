If I was Tim Cook  I would so fucking hire you ,1,0
TBH  I really want TechLead to stay  unemployed  self employed as long as possible  It is a gift seeing how free he  as a millionaire  can share his honest opinion which would obviously not be able if he was still working for facebook or microsoft  or even apple  ,2,0

  The crypt0 market is in a fierce debate  is the top of the B tcoin bull market in  Bears salivating for cheaper coins  Even if you aren t a pro at technical analysis and couldn t read a chart if your life depended on it  it is pretty clear that tops and bottoms come to a sharp point most of the time signaling a rebound is ahead and the violence left behind  Rounded bottoms do commonly appear but are a slow grind of a process and tend to stretch across a long timeframe  The shape and pattern of the recent BTC  top  have many tr ders and analysts confused  Where is the blow off phase  Where is the bearish retest  What type of pattern even is this  All of these questions are used as firepower to make an argument that this isn t a top  BTC is clearly suffering prlce manipulation but the top ain t in yet  now s a very good time to accumulate more coins in your portfolio while waiting for the price to run up  I tr de daily with tr de signals from Edward James and I have been able to increase my portfolio from 3 btc to slightly over 12  With his tr de signals being copied in my trades and exchange  my tr des have gotten better and I urge lnvestors to find suitable tr de guides and do the same  I can attest to the accuracy of his tr de signals and he can be reached on               M      Edwardjames022     for more inquiries into his services ,1,0

Personally I thought it was a bigger attack on zoom,22,3
 Sokrates297 literally Apple said it s cross platform available on Android and Windows   It was also mentioned in that video ,1,
Well  this is an Apple only solution  so no cross platform video meetings  So zoom is still relevant ,2,
I agree but I ll rephrase it  it is something Apple supposed to offer  ten years ago   ,2,

 Te h Helip  n H nd  Adm n  seems legit   Pined  by techlead  ,2,
Apples biggest weakness is not having Picture in Picture features  calculator app on their iPads   multitasking features  and complete partial user interface customization  It s so frustrating to want to like a company who s sole purpose was to innovate but instead became more focused on marketing  I don t have any faith that apple will take out Facebook anytime soon,1,1
 Te h Helip  n H nd  Adm n  awesome I definitely will  ,1,
As much as it pains me to say it  as Facebook royally screwed my beloved TechLead  all is not lost for Facebook   They could align with Google and lead the way for advancements in Progressive Web App technology which mimic native functionalities ,1,0

He s an Expert in trading and mining cryptos and I trade with his intelligent strategies,1,
Crypto is the future   My advice to anyone right now is to secure a good investment in digital assets like cryptocurrencies,2,
I invested in both stocks and crypto but my crypto Investment is more profitable,1,
That s correct  Investing in Crypto now is very wise especially with the current DIP in the market now  I bought the dip  ,6,
I want to wake up one morning and find out that my portfolio is  80 000   I know it s possible,14,13

  ,1,
I dislike Facebook and Apple  but I dislike Facebook more  ,2,0
Facebook really put themselves in this position  Their data collection  shitty practices  never ending engagement spam has instead had the effect to cause everyone to just utterly mute them  I m not a big apple fan though they re tempting me over on the mobile side ,1,0
oh noooo   ,1,0
Next he will sell all his dollars   ,1,0
Every time Apple stock goes down I look at the balance sheet and feel 10x better,6,0
Apple has the advantage of not needing advertising dollars ,14,5
 Andre Revenue is how much money is earned  not how much is spent  So yes  Apple spends a good amount of on ads  but that s money  spent   They  make  their money off of iPhone sales  Facebook makes money off of hosting advertisments on their platforms  Fb  Ig  etc   And they need somewhere to host those platforms  Somewhere like iOS devices  Apple doesn t need an external host  They sell directly to consumers  So I think Peter s comment was highlighting Apple s strategic advantage here ,1,
What do you mean not needing advertising dollars  Bruh  they literally spend millions of dollars of ads   EDIT  Out of curiosity  I looked it up  they spent 1 8 billion usd last 2018 on advertising alone ,1,

i sold cardano at 1 83 recently bought spy calls on dips and 8 3 clov lol,3,0
Naked short like the hedgies,1,
I know tech stocks are in a dangerous precarious spot but that s mostly because hedge funds are positioning themselves to see an increase in interest rates which is very bad for growth stocks but hedge funds are not the largest holder of tech stocks it s the General Public so they will be oversold buy a lot if the Federal Reserve does raise interest rates and that s when hedge funds will come in and buy them Pennies on the dollar that s when I would buy too,1,0
If you really think about it  what he is saying is all backed up by reputable sources and even company print  He is no financial consultant  but just calling it how he sees it  Aside form panic selling  which is never good  the information is justifiable  Maybe not his panic sell  if he actually sold the jokester techlead,1,0
Also Apple was successfully able to kowtow    coff I mean penetrate into the Chinese market  Facebook no ,1,0

Can it be that a lie often repeated even sarcastically becomes a person s reality  even if it isn t real    He jumps from sarcasm to irony to jadedness that he sometimes gets too caught up in it  and becomes real to him  it seems ,2,
I tried to stop watching him    but after a few other videos someplace else  I came back ,1,
tbh i don t know whether TechLead knows himself when he trolls and when he doesn t  I assume he has a mild form of bipolarity disorder,1,
When i first saw this guy i thought he was just a pompous git  Then i got to watch a few other of his vids and realised he actually is a pompous git  I love this guy,2,
did you know he is a millionaire ,4,
Its satire and self irony  with a mix of real life issues  wife leaving him etc ,8,
yo same here  I keep binging his videos  his humor is just perfect  D,2,
One man  One Voice  One Million Sub   surely he is captivating   ,3,
Welcome to the party,2,
Because of the shift from coding to leading  some tech lead dev s like running and they end up doing ultra marathons  some bike and end up racing professionally  I think he s one of those but for Youtube programming channels,3,

Apple and Fecesbook were overhyped by corporate media lies since day 1  Any techy knows this    especially security techies  They only used billions in ads to gain popularity with youth by using celebrity advertising and super bowl ads to get noticed  Apple and facebook are the Kardashians of tech    paid for attention in media ,1,0
People can say what they want about Techlead  but this guy knows what his talking about    gives much better info than most other Youtubers ,89,3
Indeed bro,1,

The guy found a glitch in the YouTube algorithm  as a millionaire  to be precise ,33,
So  It s a smart play that pays are you just jealous ,4,
no thats graham stephan,10,
 Ayush Mehre I think he means that he s flipping words to use to his advantage  Hence altering algorithms,8,
 Arnaud DSM plus the adsense is probably 2x because of how competitive the niche is for advertising,20,
 Ayush Mehre Cryptocurrency and stock market BS just multiplied his monthly views by 2    YouTube darwinism at its best    The algorithm chooses what s best for us,65,
