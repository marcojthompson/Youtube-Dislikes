I realized that the secret to making a million is making better investment   I always tell myself you don t need that new Car or that vacation just yet and that mindset helps me make more money invest   ng   For example last year I invested 70k in blue chip stocks and crypt0 s   with the help of my advisor of course   and made about 380k   but guess what   I put it back and traded with her again and now I m rounding up close to a million   Delayed gratification always pays off,60,19

I view Bitcoin as the more democratic version of money and value transfer because no one controls it    I expect the Internet to be around longer than any nation state  so a nation state backed currency is actually less safe than an Internet currency in my mind ,189,4

I love this video because he gives real strategies for growth of your holdings during unstable market times or even downward market periods   However his explanation for why crypto is staked is let s say imperfect   Staking is a replacement and upgrade to traditional mining and less energy intensive   It returns value similar to mining   Without having a server GPU farm   Proof of stake is the next generation of coin creation and value creation  Bur before then  I ve been trading with  Moneyhaveninvestment ORG  and it s very profitable,245,0

Interesting consideration  have to consider digital land probably won t function like physical land obviously  but I see application  The issue right now is no one can foresee where this space is heading  Metaverse is an obvious choice in purchasing land as it s backed by FB but when I bought my VR headset a lot of people didn t want to have any association with FB like having to create an account to access their VR profile  I think if fears of future pandemics persist people will be more willing to stay home and interact on VR for shopping and social events  not to mention viewing events in other countries without the costs of flying  etc  There s a lot of potential and opportunity to integrate with cryptocurrency when you deal with the right source like  Moneyhaveninvestment ORG  but there s probably a long way until a platform exists for it ,1,0

The regular lending rates on FTX are quite good compared to most banks  but they fluctuate by the hour  and also intra hour  but you re generally not paid for that   Meanwhile staking is a set yearly amount that seldom changes  but then you have to find a good entry and bare the risk that entails  On the other hand  I consider the opportunity cost of not owning crypto these days to be much of a much higher risk  That is to say  I think  not  owning crypto is far more risky than owning it  due to various things not limited to stupid fiscal policies and Fed money printing  So the best is owing it  trading and investing with it  I learned that from a crypto expert from TheSpaceHackers Com I ve made tons of profits btw ,20,1

No doubt alot of opportunities will present it self this year as the markets have been searching for liquidity for the past 69days  As you can see from the charts   In case you wondered  we are looking at a 5 fold range bound fractal  This must be the rangiest range I ve seen in years for Bitcoin  The vast majority of discretionary traders tend to become more and more hopeless as the range box develops  It s a patience test failed by many  This is a pivotal moment and that s why the majority will regret  If it goes down  people say  why haven t I sold If it goes u  people say  why haven t I bought   In September 2021 bulls trapped the bears  check the lower wick on 21th of September and now a buy signal has been given which strongly indicates a final bottoming process is locked  One of the scenario s from career trader Callum Lucas is that bulls will use the same trick  as his automated sig    nals based on unique combinations of trend  momentum and volume scanners supports this thesis  So far I ve accumulated over 8BTC trading with it  If interested then reach out through Te  E G  m  callumlucas,135,3

I do not agree with your prediction that Cardano will fail  I consider myself to only be an average developer and I m not scared of Haskell  If I got put on a Cardano project  I ve no doubt I d be productive soon enough  The EVM is not the be all and end all  Just because ETH was 1st out of the blocks with its huge ecosystem  does not mean it will win the race  Projects like Harmony are awesome and it would be great to see it rise as a Layer 1 choice  rather than an ETH roll up  I d be happy to see ETH fade off  kinda like My Space and maybe Justin Timberlake can buy that too ,1,0

If you really think that most people will make money on crypto then you are fvcking insane   First of all if you are trading for a long time  you know for a fact that only new york  London  asian markets and so on are the one who really make gains and 10 percent of traders  Maybe stocks might make sense as an investment since it is giving some dividends  But crypto  Give me a break   Even in long term investment in crypto  moonbois like your fans can t save crypto from oblivion BECAUSE people are tired of losing  the interest is very low in trading because majority of people lose all the time    And what will happen if people lose interest  Of course it will go down ,1,0

 When it comes to the world of investing most people don t know where to start  Fortunately  great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance ,28,44
I think I have heard this name somewhere from my neighbors,1,
 Rashid Mehmood Of course  you can  They re different packages  I started with  3500 and I m earning massively right now,1,
This is helpful for my situation   thanks  Guys I will try her but Do you know how much is ok for a start let me know if I can do this,1,
 Irena Vu kovi   I will eventually become a millionaire but with many recommendations here on YouTube,1,
I m new here how to wish I knew about crypto trading earlier stock is good but crypto is better ,1,

 Mike Spofford  Yes  it s not watching videos and wasting time on strategies  I was ignorant doing so till i Met Kathy lien sometime early last year at a startup funding event  She had some interesting things to say about the state of algorithmic trading today  very obviously I m seeing the results  and my trading is going smoothly ,2,
The highest paying job or investment with the lowest barriers of entry is trading forex  Crypto If you know how to trade  you can make a ton of money no matter where you find yourself ,1,
 Irena Vu kovi  Well  it s all about positioning and how valuable you are to the marketplace  If the marketplace thinks you deserve 1 million dollars or more  it will in turn give you that amount ,1,
When we asked our followers from different platforms what is your immediate financial goal  most of them said that they want to make their first million  So that s what we re doing today ,1,
Successful trading require discipline  patience  adaptability  mental toughness  independence  and forward thinking ,1,
After watching several YouTube tutorial videos about trading I am still making losses,1,
Crypto currency is gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come  you got any advice for someone that is fresh to crypto  Don t know where to start  ,121,20
 Nathan QUEENNET that s true  most people today have been having a lot of failures in forex and crypto sector because of poor orientation and lack of experience ,1,
investing in crypto was encouraging till losses came in  couldn t  figure out what I was doing wrong  I Lost a lot of money ,1,
The stock market has been a really tough one this past months  but I watched an interview on CNBC where the anchor kept mentioning     BELLA ADAMS      This prompted me to get in touch with her  and from October 2021 till now we have been working together  and I can now boast of  540k in my trading portfolio ,9,10
Wow  Great info    Coding is important    So many dapps on AVAX      Defi is where the money is at all those LP pools expect  defi 2 0 and 3 0 is do new ,1,0

Cardano was the most developed blockchain in 2021  I can t see how they are missing developers  2022 will be the year where the cardano system really gets going with the first big projects launching in february  Additionally charles hoskinson announced they are done with researching and planning  They will go on full speed developing mode and we might see hydra as early as october  With all this ahead  I don t really see cardano going anywhere ,131,32
It s all about network SECURITY and DECENTRALIZED    Only Ethereum can survive ,1,
Cultdano,1,
Right  here  are my thoughts  Cardano  has a ticking time bomb strapped to its chest  If it can convince other daps from eth to migrate to them instead of polygon  than there is a chance for them to recover  To build something from scratch or even to redeploy on Cardano would be time consuming and complicated because of the Programing language  So although Cardano is compatible with EVM you also need bridges to move across chains so keep that in mind  funds will not magically teleport from Eth to Cardano in a day  either  As opposed to this There is a bridge already between Eth and Solana allowing assets to circulate back and forth for example  The second question you need to ask is  Wouldn t it be simpler for these people to use Polygon instead ,4,
 One Headlight No  At this time no other Blockchain supports native tokens  so it is not possible to run natively on any other chain  as far as I am aware,1,
Thank you  This had to be said  Cardano already supports EVM and will more natively support Solidity in the near future  Why would anyone pay the ETH gas fees when they can run the same dApp for far less on Cardano  and easily migrate the application ,5,
I agree  This guy doesn t know what he is talking about  ADA does support on EVM and they have an eth bridge  Nvm that they have big things in store for 2022  This is dumb content  This video is nothing but misinformation,13,
 One Headlight Yeah  their approach was  study first  implement afterwards   which kinda takes longer to complete  Well  we will see if it works  IMHO there is enough space for the major blockchains for now  no need to kill ETH to be successful I guess  In fact  except for a few  almost all crypto predictions are off ,5,
You are missing the point  development of cardano infrastructure was great but project development by other devs was not,1,
 Casey Chisholm Heil Hydra   ,2,
when the space reaches 1billion users Cardano might be the only chain who can handle it imo,7,
Cardano is trash,2,
Plutus Dev checking in  I created a DAO and we are developing systems to allow people to create DAOs on Cardano without any technical experience ,11,
 majmunOR wrong   u just need 5 10  Amazing projects    not 1000s of useless  projects,18,
 majmunOR There are plenty of dapps and defi buing built in cardano preparing to launch this year  a few are already up and running  smart contracts are already being utilized  doesn t actually need that much research to know this ,15,
 LucidIntrovert hahaha ikr,6,
 cardano simply does not have a strong developer ecosystem  lmao,24,

This days so many bots in the comments section very difficult to trust here but  I don t Really kich against holding   But due to the btc predictions  a lot of people has taken it as an advantage to hold and wait for bitcoin to skyrocket  although this is not what we expected the current bitcoin price to be as always predicted  I know so many people in the market depend on buying at low price and selling high  u don t advice that because of the unpredictable nature of the market  Trading these Crypto assets which are just at the point of skyrocketing hereby accumulation more instead of losing it to the bears is the best advice and strategy  In order to get full understanding and guidance  the help of an expert like mentor99 Susan would do so much good in the market  I have made over 8 BTC from just copying the dip  I am spreading this for those who haven t been able to make a consistent profit off the market    can be reach on                      ,2,2

 I have been mining for about 6 months now and just about every trade slaps me in my face  Nearly impossible for me to catch more than a few points    I try to do top down analysis and MTF analysis  but it doesn t work for me   I say to myself  clearly I m in the 90  that lose money  so I open a demo account  do my analysis  then take the opposite of what I would normally take I know  it sounds stupid but I was desperate  and get the same result  I m starting to feel hopeless  any advice for a struggling trader  ,48,9
 robert anderson  Don t let him discourage you  don t give up  Trading takes years to master  even the pros learn everday  Never the less  if you lose money no matter which side you take  maybe you need to look at how you are managing active trades rather than how you are entering them  moving stops to BE may help  My advice  find a mentor   And also  try incorporating the use of oscillators or rsi into your strategy to make your entries better and prevent overtrading  And most importantly move to higher TFs 4h or 1D preferably   you ll thank me later   ,1,

I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling  Tradlng went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 12 5 BTC when I started at 3 4 BTC  in few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Thomas Chaung   You can reach Thomas on  eI    m thomaschaung,96,9

In my opinion ADA and Solana will continue growing up  Cardano is working with governments and there are projects coming up that will make it grow  Solana in 2022 will grow as will be released on july a game made with unreal engine 5 and the developers and designers are world know as they come from big movies as star wars  Maybe on the future Solana will down but not in 2022  Anyway  nice video and hope you continue doing videos like that  Thanks ,23,2

 Don t fight the trend  is an old saying  and there are other variants of the phrase like  never catch a falling knife   The bottom line is that traders should not try to anticipate trend reversals  or even worse  try to improve their average while losing  It really doesn t matter whether one is trading soy futures  silver  stocks or cryptocurrencies  Markets generally move in cycles  which can last from a few days to a couple of years  In B  TC s case  it s hard for anyone to justify a bullish case by looking at the chart  It is much more complicated than some would have you believe but from Eddy James approach  bear market aren t worth losing from if you use the ongoing new bie investor programs  A portfolio I got into the strategy with 1 3B TC was quickly increased to 6 6B tc ,54,7

What Is Salvation   Everyone experiences pain in their lifetime  No one asks to be hurt  Yet pain is commonplace in our lives  Our pain is the direct result of sin in the world  It is because of that sin that we experience pain and are separated from God  However  there is still hope for us and that hope is through Jesus Christ  God came down from heaven as the man Jesus  lived a perfect life  and then died an innocent death on the cross so that we could live a free and unencumbered life with Him ,1,0

Hello   from Germany         ,2,0
Good vid but disagree with your assessment of Cardano   Cardano is literally on the cusp of releasing its first main Dapps   The snowball is just about to be pushed down the mountain as there are hundreds of dapps being built on it right now   more than most of the blockchains you mentioned,12,0
Like your vids and tech approach  however I feel that there is a lot of hidden product placement here ,3,0
I like Tech Lead  His Knowledge about this market is very accurate  ,1,1
I agree about ADA  I gave up on them at the coinbase launch ,3,1
 If it s not obvious now  it ll be obvious in hindsight     The Techlead  2022,85,4
To be fair  it s always obvious in hind sight so that s not really prophetic or anything ,1,
I think this is irresponsible  You should always mention crypto and block chain is speculative in nature and high risk  Maybe some value can be added but ultimately it is not producing anything  It is a store of value  Guys don t take financial advise anywhere on YouTube  specially if the channel is often sponsored by crypto brokers  Always do multiple source research and cross check everything ,2,2

  Crypto YouTubers need to stop looking for reasons that the market is struggling solely on what is happening in the Crypto market   The World financial system is on the edge People are nervous not just about the Crypto market   but all markets  If it goes off the edge Crypto will take a massive dive just like all other markets   Suppress the market for the real money to come in  ergo the lengthening of the cycle    I wish I had bought more   I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience to do exactly what you have said in this post   Micheal Richard has been doing a great job reviewing all chart   trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my port folio to 11btc lately  I would wait and see how the market react to first interest increase to understand batter which direction would put BTC      ,49,4

ADA is wil be bigger this year it s already up in 2021 with only the staking function and 2022 wil much bigger with the release of all the dapps and the ERC 20 converter   But i do believe the wil be a new top 10 crypto list regarding to market cab,2,1
yeah sadly OP seems a bit misinformed about ADA  Was pretty disappointed with the misinformation this video provided ,1,
First of all  you remind me a bit of Neo  So that s dope  How do you feel about Solana and AMP more specifically ,1,1
cardano has the erc 20 converter coming and milkomeda to deploy solidity code on ada without the gas fees  you are willingly ignoring those facts,14,2

Thanks for continuous great videos  The fact is  NFTs  BTC is the future of crypto and the question most traders ask themselves is   if this is right time to invest  I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in this space in general or probably just na ve  the sphere have seen far worse times than this  enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions  I d say that more emphasis should be put into tradng  since it is way profitable than hodling  Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9 BTC when I started at 1 5 BTC in just 5 weeks of implementing trades with signals and insights from Russell Owen   I would advise you all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren t sure about  Say hello to Russell for a fix ,50,5

I think Bitcoin will tend toward the yellow part of the rainbow chart   stock to flow model  with fewer of the insane pumps and crashes we ve seen until now  It will still be a good investment but it will lose volatility  There will be countless Dogecoin copycats which will all fail in the long run  but they will make a few bucks for their creators  Dogecoin itself will stabilize around  0 20 and turn back into a reliable stable coin  My gamer coin in Enjin  and my web 3 coin is ETH  although there s a strong case to be made for an alternative to ETH   But don t count out Fluffy coin  and of course  MM,2,0

I would argue if a cryptocurrency is to become mainstream then haskel will be learned and used for security reasons   I just cant shake the feeling that most cryptos look like candy and will break your teeth but cardano is a healthy balanced diet   ,13,3
3 55 his problem is thinking  competitors making so much headway already  he fomos the fastest one  If you think about it  why is Cardano already  6 worldwide in market cap  if it is the slower one to grow  The peer review  the biggest community and the slowest growth with solid and secure bases will make Cardano the winner  If the slower and bigger one is already  6 worldwide  well do the rule of 3  it will easily end up  3 and maybe  1 but people like him fomo and don t think long term  The rabbit and the turtle   Conor went king real fast  but where is Khabib now with slow and steady solid wrestling bases   Fomo thinks wining by standing up  Cardano knows it s MMA and needs to work on his wrestling first ,4,
