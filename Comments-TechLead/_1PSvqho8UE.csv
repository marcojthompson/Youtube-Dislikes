INVESTING IN CRYPTO NOW IS VERY COOL EXPECIALLY WITH THE CURRENT RISE IN THE MARKET  ACT NOW ,74,156
keep buying and investing in stocks or crypto soon Bitcoin will hit  100 000,9,9
Hey  TechLead  This video is interesting  Learned a lot from you  Opensea is really centralized   How about Starlight NFT  Any ideas  guys ,1,0
Investing in the stock market is the best option to make a passive income   Virtually all the markets are crazy  most people pay more attention to the shiniest position on the graph  I m keeping a diversified portfolio ,189,8
Remember  diversification is an approach to help manage investment risk  It does not eliminate the risk of loss if security prices decline  Because investing can be complicated  consider working with a financial professional to help guide you on your wealth building journey ,1,
very good,1,0
Came back to watch this again after Opensea has been hacked and millions in NFTs stolen ,1,0
Very nice synopsis  The hype of the current market is simply that    hype  No one really knows these intricate details and are simply walking into a trap with many centralized services simply pushing the hype  I would add that Open Sea also scrapes the blockchain to see what NFT are minted to the blockchains  This allows users to buy and hold 721 1155 in their Web3 wallets as well  So it s not entirely a closed off system  That adds a huge benefit because it uses two contracts  the blockchain contract and a marketplace contract  A hybrid service  Like ours ,1,0
Damn this is one of the best crypto videos I ve watched in a while  I d be curious to hear how NFTs work on other chains  IIRC  NFTs on Solana are tokens with a count of 1  Makes me think that NFTs are associated with your wallet address and not vice versa ,1,1
I M NEW TO BTC AND I VE BEEN MAKING LOSSES TRYING TO MAKE PROFIT MYSELF IN TRADING   I THOUGHT TRADING DEMO ACCOUNT IS JUST LIKE TRADING THE REAL MARKET    CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT OR AT LEAST ADVISE ME ON WHAT TO DO ,3,2
Wow scary  Great content again,2,1
So let s DDoS OpenSea maybe ,2,1
NFTS are Here to stay  No matter what your opinion is ,1,1
This is the same as you bought any Token  Coins  at Binance  The Token never be yours  They belongs to Binance  Its the same to all CEX es  Just saying  Do your own research ,1,0
I feel that only the government can pull of blockchain technologies because they invented them and they are basically a government algorithm  they replace the complicated bureaucracy of governments and someday blockchain and government will be interchangeable terms,1,0
Until a single central blockchain exists none of this matters  I guess this is kind of what etherium and bitcoin try to be but they just aren t  I don t think it s possible ,1,0
I have been saying for a while  until an actual nft blockchain exists  where the image is stored on the blockchain only and can only be sold on the blockchain  a single blockchain which does not even exist yet ,1,0
NFTs  from an investment standpoint  feels just like the beanie baby bubble  99 9999999  of them will be worthless soon   People will only buy NFT s because they like the image not to make any financial gains ,1,0
bloomin heck   your right,1,1
Your findings are welcome and not surprising     A related question  why do geeks waste their time and money with fake ownership of fake scarcity   We should know better ,1,0
Why your videos are not divided into playlists  it will make it easier for me to watch your videos related to specific topic ,1,1
i ve vaguely heard about full onchain projects like crypto punks  and avastars   are the ones that will never disappear even if opensea shuts down  is this true ,1,1
Nft spec should require the metadata and it s image url be hosted using ipfs or  a decentralized blockchain storage service  Anything else is useless ,1,0
I guees   this how u right off your taxes  And in crash  Its just disappear ,1,0
How does work when there are projects like Guzzler that allow you to mint a NFT Car in their game to use in other Metaverse games   Perhaps what you are mentioning here will be the downfall of Opensea  while this makes sense as well for cross chain NFT marketplace projects and how they may operate ,1,0

Additional post actions You think its funny to take screenshots of people s NFTs  huh  You think its funny to take screenshots of people s NFTs  huh  Property theft is a joke to you  I ll have you know that the blockchain doesn t lie  I own it  Even if you save it  it s my property  You are mad that you don t own the art I own ,1,0
so glad i found your videos again  your bluntness is always appreciated,1,1
I disagree on when opensea down u can t access your nft  because you can still check your nft in your wallet using etherscan or even metamask  maybe i dont get your point ,1,1
I ve stopped doing any work in blockchain,1,0
I noticed these as well so I stopped doing art work after I noticed  Not to mention nft has a flaw with people only buying nft s from certain groups are buying for art but rather from certain groups ,1,0
can i steal ur brain or does opensea own that too,1,0
This whole effort to legitimize NFT assets is moot if I can just take a screenshot  There s no true ownership ,1,1
Open Sea are faking it until web 3 0 is capable  They want to be the market leaders  Once web 3 0 is available we wont need websites like open Sea anyway as the whole internet will run different  where individuals have control and not over hyped corporate money grabbers ,1,1
Cardano FTW with its native assets,1,1
LOOPRING L2 WALLET    solves this problem,1,0
Glad loopring made a nft wallet,1,0
Arguably  the need to loop through all NFTs to determine someone s collection is a privacy feature  not a flaw  The user can still keep track of their own NFTs and easily prove to anyone they wish that they own them  Of course  many of the people buying NFTs want everyone to know without the need for technical know how   ,4,0
Bruh  Cant you just check contracts the address has interacted with  Then you can check balanceOf function  assuming it is erc721 ,1,0
You should simply not use it for NFT creation  The proper way for NFT creation is to deploy your own ERC721 contract  or let a dev do that for you  and store your images on IPFS  most people pick pinata to do so  ,1,0
I own NFTs only from Elrond blockchain  They resolved this problem in a way more elegant maner    ,2,1
Same way NOBODY ever owns any of  their own  money this trick has been around since the beginning of  asset ownership  nothing new really  We re all being and have been played since the beginning ,1,0

Hey good video  but I d like to offer some opposing points and possibly a topic for you to cover in a later video so that readers aren t totally swayed against NFTs in general   I think you re right in some respects  but I don t believe its fair to imply that all NFTs on OpenSea are centralized    Ill start my argument by saying I think you were mostly right about touching on the Media storage URLs  A good portion of NFTs you find  the actual artwork  is stored centrally on company run services such as Google  etc  where if the company stops service then you lose your digital assets reference  making it pretty much useless   But that was early days  even though its still in practice  Now to touch on my main points   Firstly  There are very cool purpose driven services out there that were created to solve this  centralization  problem  One of them being  The Graph   As with any database  indexing is how users can get information quickly and reliably  by creating cloned sets of data and sorting them in ways that make sense to the service provider s architecture  The Graph does just this but with the block chain  and not only do they allow you to index Collections on the blockchain using GraphQL  but they are focusing on decentralization  Users can actually host their own nodes storing indexed blockchain data for blockchain data of their choosing  called  subgraphs   Anyway I highly recommend you look into this as it solves a big problem of what you re referring to   The second problem you referred to was the storing of the digital asset itself  While a lot of NFTs are being stored on services that are centralized  IPFS file system is actually being used by a LOT of NFT collections now as a decentralized way of storing media and metadata  Its still being adopted and growing  but it is growing fast and helping solve the very problem you re talking about    I think you bring up some good points  but I don t think everyone should read this and think that their NFTs are all centralized because that s just not true  Labeling OpenSea as 100  centralized isn t so far from the truth  but many readers will see that and get the wrong idea  Just think you could  I m curious about your thoughts on this   EDIT  I realized that you mentioned IPFS so thank you  but still important to look into The Graph   ,1,0
To be honest  I m surprised NFTs AREN T stored on centralised databases  After all  a unique token is still unique  whatever type of database  like a blockchain  its on,3,0

Gotta a friend who work at OpenSea as a software engineer      She said if you wanna make a lot of  money with NFT You have to someone on the inside    Because how this works is that the NFT companies select a particular NFT NFT artist that they will create a Huge buzz about through social media   so if you really wanna make money with NFT you gotta know which NFT these companies wanna create a hype about ,6,7
Yh she can  but is not gotta be for free though   But trust me it s gonna be worth it  ,2,
Unfortunately this is far from a beginner s enquiry  I m new to the DeFi and crypto system,1,2
You didnt complete the video   It looks like your knowledge is half baked here    read some of the comments   you will understand why you are wrong   Opensea does not build a Contract until your NFT is Bought by someone   So your NFT starts minting only after someone has brought it with Crypto     How can they publish it on a Crypto Exchange before the Art is converted into Crypto Value     You seem to not understand what Opensea is   first understand that and then come back with a more logical video    ,2,2
Welp I can t wait for GRT network to pay someone enough for them to develop a slew of trustless APIs,1,2
Can you do the same research vid for NFTs under other L1s  Tezos  Solana  BNB   ADA  etc  NFTs ,1,2
 please answer this  I am using opensea  In my first collection i could auction my art for as low as 0 001 ethereum  But in my later collections i am unable to go below 0 05 Ethereum  What is the reason behind this  How to solve this issue ,1,2
Amazing video    The fundamentals of the technology exposed  I do think NFTs are going to become a thing  but now most of the projects are worthless ,4,2
lol  who s gonnna tell him   ,6,1
Reason it s not centralized is trust of 3rd party like a  government majority of people especially blacks have trust issues  guys like you are far ahead of the game but blacks in this society are NOT especially when you talk codes  NFTS and future problems of these platforms  not knocking what you saying but most don t want the future to be centralized mainly cause of trust issues ,1,2
I take your opinion with pinch of salt ,1,2
Try ICP,1,2
Let s be honest even cryptocurrebcy is centralized and if you ask me how no no it s p2p it s decentralized okay but who owns the infrastructure  that holds the whole system of crypto isn t that the internet itself so in my opinion there s nothing decentralized in this world unless the air we breath as long the tcp ip protocol exists there is nothing on the internet cannot be tracked ,1,2

Not true  I can see my League of Kingdoms Polygon NFT s just fine on Opensea  PlayDapp    NFTrade  BSC based   I can even list them simultaneously on all 3 platforms at the same time if I wish   ,4,2
This is really a shocking truth that needs to be adressed  Opensea is great to sell and trade NFT s  but if it goes down  the whole markt will go down  That begs the question  what would be a good solution to this  in order to bring the power  over your NFT s  back to you as a holder  I would love to have a discussion on that  I m a software engineer by the way ,1,1
7 37 bullshit  NFT s for games wont be released via opensea unless you actually got no clue wtf you doing ,1,0

It s almost we are living in an absurd parallel world since 2020  The purpose of NFT is not art  it is creating duplicating your money  You create art  your rich friend buys it  You give money back  keep the art  The art becomes a token of what has been paid  You liquidate the token  get real money  someone else can inflate it and sell to someone else  It s basically creating tokens of real money and later selling them for real money  while the owner is left worth the  idea  of value  Quite genius really  however highly highly manipulated  Not relevant either ,21,2
True,1,
Lol   if I learned about nft s correctly this far   when ppl buy nft s   ur just buying a link to a jpeg   so they must change the manner of sales of nft s    but the ppl selling them get real money   but they should only get a link to the paid money without actually having it lolol   in conclusion nft s are Tom foolery til they stop the foolery lol,1,1
The biggest problem with this issue is that the vast majority who says all NFTs are scams will look at these things at face value and conclude that blockchain as a whole is nothing more than a cash grab  then continue spewing misinformation and make adoption even harder  so thanks opensea and co  for centralising decentralisation,1,1
BSV NFTs are all stored on the blockchain,2,1
 I earn bitcoin  worth 6000usd  weekly through crypto investment with the assis tance and guidance of my advisor Max    crypto still pays,2,1
Nfts are not nfts until its minted or tokenise   when you create a NFT on opensea they don t mint until there is a sale to reduce the gas fee on you the creator but if you do it the developer s way opensea will be just a mirror of your collection e g  my collection  images and metadata  is hosted by ifps server  minted on the polygon chain to a contract so they are  unchanged on the blockchain i disagree opensea does have web 3 0 capabilities ,1,1
Hey buddy  I m asking this in a kind and concerned way  as a non millionaire  do you have many  or any  friends  You seem to always be alone  just stewing in your own thoughts  I think you would really benefit from making some genuine friends bud ,1,1
Happy new year  Thanks for watching  Don t forget to hit the subscriber button  WhatsApp             ,1,
Thank you very much for pointing this out  I was seriously tryiing to list nfts on opensea but after  browsing opensea for a  while i found something disturbing  i couldn t explain   you explained it well   So i started investigating other marketplaces   Thank you again for your candid review of Opensea  Keep it up  Being upfront to your subscribers greatly increases your credibility  ,5,1
Trying to make sense of cryptocurrencies can be a bit overwhelming for investors   It s a nascent but promising asset class built on technology that has the potential to disrupt a wide range of industries  For investors  what s probably most attractive is the possibility of life changing returns  Don t worry  you re not late to the crypto party  We re likely still in the very early innings  leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market  If you re new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert  I have learned from alot of Youtubrs  especially my mentor Jennifer Wilbur  who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 19 btc lately ,108,9
Smart man   Subbed  Eth is also centralized  Bitcoin is the only one you can call decentralized ,1,1
Ok so they created the database that doesn t make it central if they don t own the database that hosts the content  It means there are not enough market places at the moment and there may never be but this is one stage of centralization but not fully centralized,1,1
Algorand does NFT s in a way that makes more sense  as it is just an ASA Asset  on the blockchain  and when you search the ASA ID on the blockchain you can see who owns it,1,1
This is why you buy Cardano NFTs CNFTs are heating up big time ,1,1
Not to many youtubers  programers out there that actually made a token them selfs   can give you a real noulegeble perspective  ,1,1
Don t forget to declare to IRS all your profits you made with NTF   Lol,2,1
You actually own your NFTs on Elrond blockchain ,2,1
So are the nfts in cardano ecosystem legit,1,1
This is the first thing i was wondering about NFTs  Once you buy one  where do you go see that it s yours  on the blockchain and how to access it s contents  Now    let s not be so pessimistic  this is a problem with Open Sea  there could be an NFT market that does things the way it s supposed to ,11,1
i have some ideas for NFT s that need your help with TechLead,1,1
CNFT are better ,1,1

What are your thoughts on POAP NFT S ,1,1
Show us the pictures and plaques on your walls  Looks interesting with the blue lights and keyboards ,1,1
Yes this nft is worth 69 million and i just screenshoted it ,1,1
LOL  I knew this from the original ERC 20 token contract when they published it   It s basic knowledge   The account on ethereum does not contain any asset other than its Eth balance   The token contract itself stores the ownership by address in the contract itself   It s a stupid architecture to begin with   Not that I know what the solution might be ,2,1
This is really good insight on NFTs and the way opensea is working    So can we mint an nft on opensea with file hosted on IPFS or doing this way has some limitations ,1,2
You definitely can push to IPFS on OpenSea  But with IPFS you need your data to be pinned as to not get deleted  so if OpenSea is your IPFS gateway and sole pin it is a similar centralized problem with more steps  TL DR   IPFS isn t permanent by default   ARWEAVE is a potential permanent storage solution for some ,1,
Great video TechLead    It depends on which type of token the NFT is  the ERC 1155 tokens are 100  centralized  this is why you can t see the ERC 1155 tokens in your wallet  ERC 721 tokens are better  they show in your wallet and in theory  you should be able to bridge these tokens across to other blockchains that support EVM  the UNISWAP NFTs that represent LP positions are ERC 721  The big name NFTs on the Ethereum Mainnet are all ERC 721   knowing what you are buying when it comes to NFT projects is so important  If you are looking for a quality NFT  I would recommend sticking with the ERC 721 options  and staying away from ERC1155  at least for now ,4,1
Nice analysis,1,1
Exactly ,2,2
Easily one of the best videos you ve made  You ve helped a lot of people with this and cleared up a lot of questions  Good one  bruh ,21,1
It s the great jpeg bubble ,1,1
Check stacks network,1,2
Nfts came to the market place without proper plans  that s why open sea is free to upload and bianace is allowing only creators to upload nfts       Nft s are the fun part  in decentralised system   It gives you the opportunity to experience a different path in crypto    I feel nfts should have thier own block chain   where all nfts are registered on  and I can see it on any verified wallet that supports crypto and nfts ,1,1
You don t own your NFT  It s hosted by a central entity  All you own is a serial number linked to an NFT,1,0

Put it all on BSV  That s original Bitcoin at scale  It can handle all data  on chain ,1,1
Well done   I love it thank you for this video  I am an IT professional who recently became a tech writer prepping a portfolio and love to get ideas to write about and this is excellent  So many people do not understand these stuff and just get carried away with marketing messages ,5,0

What a great research about OpenSea  Ignore Opensea  in the future and hopefully we find another company that store NFT decentralizing  So that we put it in our own wallet  Many thanks ,5,2
 company that store NFT decentralizing   That s literally a contradiction  One company storing data can never be decentralized ,2,
And they look like garbage  They are not art ,1,0
Only NFT I buy are VEVE,1,1
Despite the economic downturn  I m  so happy     I have been earning  50 000 returns from my  10 000 investment every 13 days ,6,7
So does that mean you should completely avoid OpenSea  No  You should simply not use it for NFT creation  The proper way for NFT creation is to deploy your own ERC721 contract  or let a dev do that for you  and store your images on IPFS  most people pick pinata to do so   Once created each NFT can be minted from your Website  OpenSea is only useful for secondary sales  because it is popular and you receive royalties from every secondary sale ,142,10
Or just don t buy nft s,6,
The problem is what s being touted as Web3 is a going back to Web1 which was decentralized and people don t know that people don t want to be self hosting all of their applications  servers  etc  People don t want to be hosting their own e mail servers  file storage  media storage  etc  So what will get people to say hmmm I definitely want to host my own NFT  There are trade offs but you give up convenience for security  Will most people want to go through that trouble   Like a painting  NFTs need to be maintained  If a buyer purchases an NFT that relies on IPFS  it ll ultimately be on them to ensure the file continues to be hosted and available to the system ,7,
 RULAHD yeah I can believe it but yall acting like it s simple that a common crypto buyer can do it easily  It s still speciality knowledge ,1,
 Grant Rutenberg forgive me if my question seems dumb  can the image just exist on the chain like just transform it to a base64 string or something rather point to either centralize  decentralized database ,2,
 Grant Rutenberg people can simply choose     Bruh I don t even know how to simply buy one lol  Let me know when Robinhood or Coin base gets them then it will be simple ,16,
100   I find TechLead Ex tremely misleading as he knows this well  People can simply choose how to create their NFT s  Open Sea will always work both ways  Every video is becoming a MisLead  is TechLead evolving into MisLead ,14,
Ive been calling this out for months  and getting downvoted everywhere lol ,1,1
So we shouldn t get million token or million nfts ,3,1
Not into open sea  Is bad ,1,1
I m glad he s not talking about crypto or human reproduction activity again  He s actually talking about tech related content which he knows very well  Youtubers rarely know what they re talking about  NFT isn t web3   I own it  maybe not ,1,1
Thanks for your competence ,1,1
anybody know where to buy the gremoca amore per la dona ,3,2
It s donna  and don t worry mate it s 2 000 000 ADA loll,3,
Yeah when I first looked into NFTs I realized all of this and it confirmed that  at least for now and for a while probably  web 2 just makes so much more business sense than web 3 ,17,1
Thank you for your analysis Techlead   The only thing that botter s me on this channel is the frequent advertissement about Million token   ,1,1
 as a multimillionaire and web3 engineer  I 100  agree this is a design flaw in Ethereum that probably they were not expecting the number of NFT contracts to explode  and now they have to do a O N  search to find out what NFT you have   As Opensea  it has always been a Web2 5 company  You can write a contract and let Opensea find it  or create NFT in Opensea  first is decentralized  second is centralized ATM  ,4,1
some very good points ,1,1
I want you to do some research about NFTs on Elrond Network ,1,1
 The NFT doesn t belong to you  YOU belong to the NFT  I fucking lost it,49,2
 OpenSea  actually being ClosedSea   lmao  this guy is killing me,8,
I m not a tech person  but that says to me you own NFT but can t access it  that means there making money off your money  and you will never receive it  or take it out  man so complicated  but you explain it simply  I   think  Interesting stuff ,1,1
Great findings  Do NFTs need to switch off Ethereum  BSC  Why on earth do they not use ifs for all NFTs ,1,1
ETH still broken ,1,1
You made some good points  ,1,1
Well done techlead  ,1,1
yo not related but what arcteryx jacket is that  looks fresh lol,1,1
Finally someone talking about that on YouTube  That s why kadena will change everything  kda nfts will be onchain,1,1
TechLead  sometimes your videos are really good   This is one of them ,410,12
Never question the Lead  He s always right  If he says that the Moon will hit the earth in 10 days then god will make it happen ,2,
 Mat There are always new people who come to the channel like me   I like listening to mr  Techlead    I think he s a great guy ,2,
 Rama Iswara exactly,1,
Odd then  that his views have been trending unequivocally downward over the past 6 months    that would seem to imply people are tiring and no longer interested in what TechLead  as a millionaire  has to say  rant   spout   spew  ,3,
I believe in a few month he will create an NFT too  like he use to said about crypto ,8,

Man   with this discovery you have made me realize how shitty Ethereum really is,17,1
TLDR  ETH sucks,1,1
I will do my nft on avalanche,1,1
Very informative,1,1
That s why you get off Opensea and ETH  move over to Cardano NFTs   ,8,1
So the data is not stored on the blockchain  So technically you only buy a hast with a pointer  Damn wait till everyone finds out  ,1,1
Everyone like and share this video to the world,1,1
Right to the point  Good Video and Thank You   ,1,1
You are now the best crypto content creator  and youre just getting started  Great findings ,30,2
Shocking discovery   NFTs are useless outside their ecosystem ,1,1
Why don t you just take a look at NFTs onto Elrond  Or just wait for them   ,1,1
The Elrond Network fixes this ,1,1
This isn t an issue with Solana,2,2
Reeeeally informative thanks for that  Had no idea   ,3,1
  03 25 you missed the   0x  before the  id  in the uri maybe that s why you got  success  false  ,3,1
What a waste of time and literal energy  Crypto isn t a tool against the world governments  the freaking internet belongs the powers that be  I often wonder if ancient civilizations went completely digital and therefore there s no trace of them when they became extinct  We now know that the pyramids were wireless power sources that could have possibly transferred images  Imagine if Google images got hacked  your family photo history is now non existent  Digital   Nothing  And i m a tech guy ,1,1
In my opinion  99 9  of the current NFTs will be useless in 5 10 years  I do think that there is a lot of potential in the future of the space though,2,1
NFTs   digital timeshare   We all know we love timeshares  lol   ,1,2

you re technically just buying hyperlinks   edit  ppl can sell you NFT and then switch the image of the NFT to a picture of somebody pulling a rug ,2,1
Some are hosted currently because of costs and need eth network improvements to become fully decentralised,1,1
Wow I appreciate your technical savy on this NFT flaw I can t imagine the price people pay for these and how they keep you in a loop,2,1
Thanks for pulling the veil back on complicated crypto topics like this so that we can understand how they function and what is going on under the hood ,157,1

Elrond NFTs are stored in the wallet  you can find them in the same place you find your funds ,10,0
Step one  Accept adoption from ENS and Unstoppable Domains  Step two  Display wallet as the NFT provider Step three  Fetch the NFT s from that wallet ONLY on request  Step four  only store data that is manually submitted to be indexed by projects   LIKE GOOGLE  Step five  Stop sucking at problem solving ,2,1
Please make more web 3 and dapp videos  wanna learn from the best ,4,1

I think NFTs on Solana work differently  You can see all your NFTs in your wallet and put them on any Solana based exchange ,4,1
EGLD uses Maiar as it s NFT wallet  Another reason why EGLD is better than ETH,3,1
Nice vid  Thanks  ,1,0
I appreciate your time and research to be vigilant with us       ,4,2
Terra and Solana don t seem to have this problem,1,2
That s why Elrond Network has 100  ownership ,6,0
Wow   ,2,2
You should have started with the token part and then continued with the opensea situation  Starting with the opensea situation makes people think NFTs are just stupid images and not a token on a contract that can be anything  And yes the tech is not there yet but when it will be it will change a lot of things ,1,2
What do you think about Rarible in comparison ,1,2
super useful info  thanks ,3,2
I saw that Moxie article earlier today ,2,2
You essentially just own a JSON object  You don t own the NFT on Opensea  Yeah you own the url that shows the NFT  but if that data ever gets corrupted you have nothing  Opensea will die  You need a blockchain that actually stores the image ON THE BLOCKCHAIN,139,12

Pac protocol will solve this problem,1,
BSV by Craig S Wright who is Satoshi Nakamoto  He won two court cases and BSV is scalable and can do 100000 TPS where bitcoin ETH can only do 7 TPS  BSV scales to 4gb on the bsv chain ,1,
That s what ipfs is  most good nft projects use ipfs  Most of flow blockchain nfts are on ipfs for example ,2,
 WePlay ItAll To store a 2mb of data on Eth blockchain would cost about  550 000  Give or take depending on gas price  Which is why it s not done that way ,10,
NXTclone you can store files upto 2mb in size in the blockchain,2,
I think you missed the part where he showed IPFS  there s also things like arweave and other decentralised storage in the works,8,
Storing images content on the blockchain would be a stupid amount of data ,14,
That would be BitcoinSV  It s the only blockchain that stores metadata and images ON the blockchain ,2,
Woah  run away  run way    sell now  sell it all ,4,
Maybe Samsung is going to build its solution on the Cardano blockchain where NFTs are as easy to find as the native crypto currency ,12,10
Cardano lol       ,1,
is the answer a new erc format with the correct data structure ,2,0
This is so funny  Cardano created the first NFTs in March and now we have so many wallets that show the NFT inside the wallet  One of the best wallet  Nami  metamask style  was created in just a few months and it shows all NFTs   NFTs in Cardano does not need a smart contract and you can find who owns a specific NFT or which NFT you own in just a few lines of code in a decentralized way ,23,2
I don t think you got the message  There are many wallets that allow you view your NFT but they rely on opensea data and opensea is centralised ,3,
I never believed in NFTs and will never do and this makes even more sense to sttay on my belief,73,13
 xpert contender reality check  you will never be able to transfer game assets between games ,1,
 xpert contender Imagine considering any NFT on par with actual art ,1,
 xpert contender every videogames you bought you only have the license to them you don t own the game  Did you not read the EULA and ToS  Selling videogames that you virtually own is not part of the agreement  You can sell only physical disk of a video game you own because you re just selling a physical disk and the license but not the game itself  Companies that owns the game they created or they have rights to usually are the ones who sells them ,5,
 xpert contender you don t need innovations from NFT for preventing counterfeits when there are already available ways that have existed for a long time that are more reliable and does not have a huge impact on our environment ,7,
  Rohit Pandey No Idea why my comment didn t post  In short  there are a lot of factors at play  Like supply vs demand  the ability for game companies to prevent resell within a given timeframe after launch  The lack of access to extra digital items from resell  Etc  Whether you like it or not every company will be in this business in the next 10 years  Walmart is looking to get invested into NFTs  dont even know how that will work  but its coming  Steam banned NFTs because it doesnt fit with their monopolistic business model  They will reverse that decision or fall to the wayside in the next decade  Are you seriously saying you d rather be forced into permanent ownership via DRM rather than have an opportunity to recoup some of your money  Gamestop was successful for over a decade ,2,
 xpert contender why would anyone pay 60 bucks for the original game then ,2,
I guess this is for people that are creating websites LEGALLY that are trying to follow copy right laws not get sued own the rights to images GIFs videos   Most people that aren t doing this for business  would just screen shot crop the image re record the image create a GIF a new file new data use editing software   I guess its like a card  you gotta collect them all IF you don t want to recreate the image video  your self get B roll use images music that is free non copy righted pay a subscription  that gives you access to images a website  with thousands of images videos GIFs   MAYBE I m not getting it why do people care   I guess you could also say why do people collect anything make things harder  then they need to be   MAYBE theres an element of this  that I m not getting ,4,
 xpert contender you re clueless to famous legendary artists and physical artwork ,9,
 Forau DNB Lmfao this is like saying  Don t pay a million for a picasso  it s just paint and canvas ,6,
Yep  Dont trade valuable BTC and ETH for worthless trash ,20,
opensea is centralized which is a huge red flag  Need decentralized marketplace       i would not buy dumb apes anyways  Metafora has many front end applications    ,1,0
There s a reason why the NFT industry is moving en mass over to Elrond    Smart accounts  Full ownership of NFTs ,9,0
You should ve addressed why they all don t store the NFTs on a decentralized network as the Bored Apes do   The short answer is that it s very expensive to do that  so that s why they store it on a centralized network  you can go more deeply into that with another video  I m pretty sure you ll explain it good ,41,9
 Matt Matt Have you considered gaming NFTs  I have some NFTs that let me use certain characters in a game  If another player right clicks on my avatar  they don t suddenly get to play as it  They don t own it and can t make a copy the way people do with  jpgs ,1,
  Matt Matt You are definitely not getting it  the purpose of defi blockchain is totally different to what s currently being presented in the NFT backend,1,
I guess this is for people that are creating websites LEGALLY that are trying to follow copy right laws not get sued own the rights to images GIFs videos   Most people that aren t doing this for business  would just screen shot crop the image re record the image create a GIF a new file new data use editing software   I guess its like a card  you gotta collect them all IF you don t want to recreate the image video  your self get B roll use images music that is free non copy righted pay a subscription  that gives you access to images a website  with thousands of images videos GIFs   MAYBE I m not getting it why do people care   I guess you could also say why do people collect anything make things harder  then they need to be   MAYBE theres an element of this  that I m not getting ,1,
NFT     a cool idea trying to solve problems that do not exist  Yes  there is a place for it  though not as much as you would like to think ,6,
 20 a month on Pinata   Not that expensive really,3,
 Arjun Dureja The argument against IPFS is that because it s decentralized the users become the host of the images  If there are 4 users hosting an image and all 4 delete that image or their computer fries itself etc  Then the image is lost  You really need servers hosting the hash in conjunction with IPFS to make it a sure thing similar to a CDN  The upside of writing it directly to the blockchain is that it will forever be on the blockchain ,4,
 xpert contender Is there anything wrong with storing the image off chain though  IPFS is fully decentralized  The main problem with OpenSea is that they store it on a centralized database ,5,
 Arjun Dureja Yes that is the cheap way  What OP is talking about is writing the images directly onto the blockchain which drives the cost up ,3,
What makes it so expensive  Can t they run an IPFS node on their own servers ,1,
for this kind of quallity videos i follow TechLead  nice stuff,6,1
This is so true  TechLead never lies ,3,1

I ve been in this market since 2017  NF t s are basically the new crypto kitties   A lot of people lost a lot of money with dumb pictures of crypto kitties  The same will happen for NF t s   People have been brainwash that a simple Jpeg is worth something   ,8,1
Exactly  It is sad when we see crypto going under 15k again  people are so greedy into making money that they will lose everything ,1,

Why are you doing this I might as will hand you the shovel so you can keep on digging to get your NF tees yeah taste of your own logic there buddy,1,2
 The NFT doesn t belong to you  rather you belong to the NFT  Solana  Allow me to introduce myself,29,6
Solana  Centralized I can turn the switch on and off when things don t look right ,1,
But solana is a centralized crypto so that doesn t make sense either,2,
Sol is awful too shh,1,

I ve never bought an NFT on Open Sea but I have bought a CNFT and they show up in my Nami wallet  It s pretty cool to see them there but it can definitely still be imporoved ,3,1
Thank you so much  Tech Lead   I imagine digital art nft frames  ie Tokenframe  would grow in popularity    This is something I plan on looking into   I am still hanging in there  learning code and committed to make it in tech   Keep me and people like me in your prayers ,13,0
NFT sucks  as a millionaire ,2,1

NFT does not make sense,1,0
Interesting ,2,1
You re totally right  This is not Web3  this is Web2  What OpenSea does was never the purpose of NFTs to begin with  Until people get educated about the blockchain things like this will continue happening  unfortunately ,372,7
You cannot store the images on the blockchain itself  You can only barely host the links  The system is just too inefficient ,1,
I understand we are trying to go to the next web but web3 is just not good enough for anything just yet but it will be  It is obviously that OpenSea is built on best existing technology,3,
  wow   my mind is   blown ,1,1
NAMI and YOROI wallets are completely decentralised  they are not built on ETH they are built on Cardano   ,1,2
I thought they save it as an ifps link aaaand no  waaait for it  they dont  ,2,2
Thanks a lot Techlead  Great content as always,13,0
If there s a website required to retrieve information only available to them then it ll be centralized   ,1,2
Nfts are just serial numbers right now  jpg isn t on chain lol,2,2

 carlos machado I m a developer  I program in Solidity  and I ve studied the blockchain deeply for that    Of course NFTs like exposed on this video are nonsense  That s not the purpose of NFT s creation to begin with  It s not the technology s fault if people are stupid    About the web3  it s going to take years until we have a decentralized ecosystem stable enough so we don t rely on centralization  but it s coming  people seeing it or not    Now saying the web3 is a pyramid scheme is the same as saying the web2 is a pyramid scheme  It makes no sense  You can program contracts to work as pyramid schemes  but you can t say the entire ecosystem is one ,1,

 TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems  It s kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC  We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps  narrowly avoiding a long term bear market      TREND           ,11,5
