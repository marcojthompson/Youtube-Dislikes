 When looking at previous reoccuring history of bitcoin  all conditions for the bulls to take full charge has been met but for the lowest band of the bollinger band which is yet to constrict the entire band to signal a sharp upward swing  Indications also show that this is about to happen so  bit will definitely keep rising so its right time to get all in but smartly of course  Its either you are great at it and if not  there are quite a lot of services offering signals  the best to my knowledge being that of Isaac Steward s  a well seasoned trader who has proved his worth  at least to me as i made over 7 btc is a few weeks starting trading his signals with just 2  Isaac  Telegram   Isaacsteward   is very adept in TA and FA as well as analysing the markets in such a manner that other top traders should emulate,60,5

His humor is getting out of hand    ,1,1
TechLead  you are YouTube s biggest meme and I absolutely love you for that ,1,1
I do not think that applying reasoning and trying to deduce something out of unpredictable is the correct way to go  Few tweets and an army of people that think they will be rich overnight  and things can turn  In order for things to get balanced  some people need to crash hard will scare life savings betting investors    and things should be a bit more predictable  for any analysis to be valid  And alts following different trend than BTC would not hurt for diversification ,1,0

Then again you don t realize what s happening do you  Of course you can take your analysis on a flat and engineered base  and if you follow that path of course you re completely right   But you must realize something when you make a product yourself you think   at least you should   that s the most profitable and most perfect in the world  then comes reality  a neighbor of yours makes a crappie and similar to the one you have and makes a great propaganda  he gets rich and you don t sell even half of he she is selling  that s crypto    Think of it this way this way  for you it s a great loss but for the ones entering now it may mean great gains  it s a matter of perspective  Sorry for my crappie English  ,1,0

7 18  Overall don t let greed blind you  because pigs get slaughtered  And you don t have to jump right in trying to catch the dip thinking the price is going to recover right away  The recovery could take a few months  Wise words    I have already been buying the Dip   Only Cardano    but now i am regretting it because Bitcoin is currently eating up the value of all the Altcoins  Therefore its likely the Alts are going to go down much further ,1,1
