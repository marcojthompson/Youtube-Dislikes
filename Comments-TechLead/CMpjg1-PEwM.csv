Trading with an expert is the best strategy for newbies and busy investors who have little or no time to monitor trade,7,
I opted to buy 2 of the smaller ones  rather than one big one  Because  I needed more memory than a small one  but figured that splitting my funds onto a couple devices would be an extra safety precaution ,6,0

I agree with you wholeheartedly      The fact is that BTC is the future of cryptocurrencies  and traders are now wondering if this is the right time to invest    Before you come to a conclusion  you should look at things first  In recent days  the price of BTC has been fluctuating  which means that the market is currently unstable and it is impossible to say whether it will go down or up    While others continue to trade without fear of losses  others are patient  It all depends on the pattern you are trading and also the source of your signals    I would say that trading is going smoothly for me  I started with 2 5 BTC and in just three weeks I have accumulated over 13 6 BTC  Thanks to Alex Valentino  i trade using his signals and I would advise the newbie to do the same too ,221,11

I came here to learn how to trade after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made  460 000 in 4 months from  160k  Somehow this video has helped shed light on some things  but I m confused  I m a newbie and I m open to ideas ,74,39
As a newbie about to invest  you must have these three things in mind  1  Have a long term mindset     2  Be willing to take risk   3  Be careful on money usage  if you re not spending to earn back  then stop spending   4  Never claim to know   Ask questions and it s best you work with a financial advisor   I made it as a newbie by working with Brian Davis  and today I can show alot of my achievements,127,30

I have a question if you can help me out I would appreciate it   im thinking of switching from Coinbase to ledger  will the price I bought it at on Coinbase be the same once it is sent to the ledger   for example  if I bought cardano at  1 00 will it be the same price point on ledger after it is sent  a  1 00 on ledger  like if I bought something at a low will it still be held at the low on ledger  thank you,1,3
The coins you store on any exchange or wallet including Ledger will always be pegged to the spot price of that coin  For example if you bought cardano at  1 00 and the price went up to  1 20 then your cardano wherever it is stored will be  1 20  Hope this helps ,1,

Good video  One comment and concern  I ordered two Ledger Nano X  Both received and had battery temperature warnings  Did you find any of these issues when using  I never heard about it until I researched it and apparently the X series is riddled with battery issues  Ledger did accept my return and 100  refund   Something to note for your viewers ,8,5

Ledger has battery issues  So far no support from customer services ,1,1
I have purchased both Arculus and Trezor s latest wallet  IMO the Shamir backup feature for Trezor is the   1 feature  We don t think long term enough in that when something happens to us  if no one can get to your cold storage device all your crypto is lost  Shamir allows you to give key phrases to relatives or friends and only when combined can the access code then be used and the wallet s funds can be distributed based off of your trust or drawn out living will ,11,0

Here s some prophetic insight for you all   Btw thanks for review   Just in time for me     Last book in Bible revelations written thousands of years ago foretold a day that a system comes where you can t buy or sell without the  mark  of      Most of you heard of 666   So anyways the most secure way for me to make sure my wallet is never stolen and always have my keys would be to put that in me   Like a chip   Where I won t lose it  can t be used with out me  always on me for that quick need to make financial transaction   In fact to protect everyone from Lodi g their money why not make it a requirement to participate in the new financial system   Every transaction tracked no more being able to cheat the government out of their piece of the pie   In fact I don t even have to do taxes anymore they are already done for me with the data of transactions   Yep I believe that s where we are heading    The book warns us though and says taking this mark is choosing a side that we die on ,1,0
I got 2 questions   1  Is Bluetooth connection making Ledger less safe   2  Is Trezor being Open Sourced a reason to trust it more than Ledger ,5,8
 Damian Dobrev thanks for your opinion  Appreciate,3,
1  Ledger does not transfer your private key via bluetooth  It only signs a transaction  Basically  your phone says  hey ledger  here is some data  do you approve this   and the ledger says  hey phone  I approve it  here is an approving signature   The signature is created using the metadata  such as date and time of Tx  sender  receiver  etc    the private key  Even if a middleman intercepts both messages they wouldn t be able to use this information to authenticate another request  the most they could do is break the connection and prevent the transaction from happening  I m not familiar with the bluetooth encryption and how easy it is to decrypt it  but if it s possible then the attacker could also technically see the metadata of your message  but not the private key   For reference   intercepting your laptop s wifi is teeeechnically more dangerous because if you login to a website for example you actually send your  private key   which is your  usually encrypted  password  to the server  whereas with ledger you never send sensitive data   2  Yes  Open source   closed source 100  of the time when it comes to security  Personal opinion  I think the device is build in a way where it is very unlikely that it will ever be a problem  so I think there are other factors that are more important  such as user experience  metamask other wallets support  price  etc   Personally I use Ledger for the aforementioned factors  Would I prefer it to have open source software  Hell yes  Does it bother me that it s not open source  Not really ,6,
 JoelAz909 thanks for your opinion,1,
imo  yes and yes   1  Bluetooth has had multiple vulnerabilities and exploits   I can t say if they have affected the Ledger but the vulns are in the hardware so even if they haven t a future exploit could   Personally I would not want BT anywhere near a device I want to be completely secure  period   Security and convenience are often at opposite ends of a spectrum  2  I would trust source code that I  and anyone  can read and verify more than source that no one can verify   I wouldn t expect Trezor to harm their reputation by doing anything shady but  cards on the table  is always better than  cards under the table  imho    Also  closed source is slightly more vulnerable to a supply chain attack whereas with open source you have a way to publicly verify the firmware and changes ,9,

Hey  just got into crypto this week   I Just purchased my first bit of Crypto yesterday  and I m considering the Nano s for storage offline  however  I just read a thread detailing the data breach whereby dozens of peoples personal information got leaked  Obviously these people didn t gain access to anyone s funds  that s the whole point of a hard wallet   yet I m considering buying a Trezzer because they don t seem to have any glaring weaknesses  any potential hackers would need the actual device itself to gain entry  Any thoughts or advice for a noob  Thanks ,1,1
Hi,1,
What about the DCENT Wallet  ,1,1
Thanks for all you do   Extremely helpful and informative content   God bless ,3,1
What happens if the wallet s hardware breaks or get damaged ,2,0
Have been using the safepal wallet since it came out  and would recommend it  works really nicely  good pirce  and love the interface and using  aside from the mentioned sometimes excessive fumbling with the cameras  Now there are the LP staking systems  and a DEX integrated which is really nice  Only real downside is battery life ,8,3
Is it compatible with MetaMask,1,
Security wise you can t beat the trezor  all suite and firmware code is open source as well,1,1
 NRMN IS SAIFU          THIS IS DE WAY,1,1
After watching Cruising on Crypto s nightmare story of how he lost most of his money from a MetaMask   WiFi hack  your video is like a balm  I m now aware of the critical importance of these things  Hackers only improve over time  Thank you  A Ledger it is ,5,0
1 question  For staking purpose  should I get nano X instead of S  Nano S can only be installed about 4 wallets at a time  Nano X can be installed about 30 wallets  I understand that you can delete the wallet after you transfer your coins to that wallet in nano s and install another wallet for another coin  But can you still stake that coin for interest after you delete that wallet  Even if you delete that wallet  it doesn t mean that coin is gone  The coin will still be in ur wallet and it will also show up in ledger live but probably not be displayed in the ledger device but that coin is still inside that ledger wallet  I know that with nano x  its got enough wallets for staking purpose so u don t need to delete any wallet  But nano s is only  60 so I m just trying to save sum     too ,3,2
Hello did you got the answer I would like to know that too,1,
Wait people carry two wallets while travelling   Am I that poor never heard of this lol,3,2

You are funny man you are cool I like your info you make sense to all this craziness out there,2,1
Lol   l like yur sense of humor my man  Wait what is your name ,1,1
Everyone recommends those wallets  My question is since its an electronic device prone to failure what happens if it breaks  stops working  short circuits we all know devices fail how do you retrieve your wallet if it stops working ,3,2
your 12 or 24 passphrase words is the key to restore all to another hardwallet or even to a softwallet ,7,

ledger is made of poor quality materials  i had to unassemble it to fix the usbc port because it couldn t be charged properly when i unboxed it and started to use it for the first time ,1,1
Thank you  just the type of information I was looking for   Side note   I had been subbed to your channel before  but some how became unsubbed  I m still wondering how that occurred  I m the only user on my devide and never carry it with me  or any other device  feels too much like a leash   But I have heard of others being unsubbed from other channels  so maybe that s what happened  I most likely will never know ,1,1
I like the metal wallet as a form of insurance  I don t think the designers intended it to be used for everyday transactions  That s what the Trezor and Nano etc are for  The metal wallet allows you to keep your seed words safely stored away in addition to any paper copy you might make  That way they are always recoverable regardless of fire  flood  EMP  explosion  etc  That I believe is the intent of that design ,1,1
I m a pc and android user but I heard that apple devices are much more secure in terms of viruses and most of all other threats   is it a good idea to switch to apple devices to use them for all crypto related stuff  Is it worth it ,5,5
yes the mac devices are generally safer,2,
Apple  for sure  I got sick of worrying about it ,3,

 I totally agree with what you are saying   I started in crypto in February 2018  and I bought in   I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85  during the ensuing 4 year bear market   I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 3 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do   I wish I had bought more   I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience to do exactly what you have said in this post   I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor KEITH B JERRY who taught me how to make trades and increase my crypto daily  ive went from 4btc to over 12btc in few weeks   no one really knows what is going to happen and I know you are only saying what you think will happen based on the past   It is yours and my opinion so people should make their own investment choices based on their own research   ,45,8

Some of these devices may be hackable with physical access  Trezor  notably   you still need to store your backup phrase somewhere  and what happen on long term if you miss updates or the manufacturer just disapears   What do you think is the best solution for very long term holders  Isn t secure cold  storage of a private key better than a passphrase  since the passphrase could become unusable if the associated wallet is discontinued by the editor manufacturer ,1,3
There is still some counter party risk involved with ledger as their software is closed source   I don t like the idea that they might have a back door into my assets ,71,9
 Xander Linhares Okay thanks for your answer  I think I go with Trezor One for start   ,1,
 Germ Honestly  I don t have a good answer   If you only hold Bitcoin and don t plan on selling for the foreseeable future  you could use a paper wallet  but obviously use something more resilient than paper    If you use a hardware wallet  look for ones whose code is open source and audited   I m not endorsing anything specific ,2,
Yay  I ll take the hardware wallet with the camera built in   ,5,1
I don t have a secure wallet yet but if I do I would like to go with Ledger Nanox  this is the one I will buy ,2,1

I can t afford it because I already sold my kidney to buy tokens  As a poor guy this video isn t for me ,1,2
As a millionaire I just run my own node,1,2
I think to be fair to Trezor you should have bought Model T because it is the latest just like you got the latest Ledger,12,2

It s strange how people talk about all the profits  they have been making through trading of crypto  while am here making huge losses  Please can someone put me through on the right path or at least advise me on what strategy to follow ,4,4
This came out a day after I bought my Nano X  Glad I bought it ,2,1
Hhhhh Epic intro LMAO,1,1
Hodl your crypto and get a miner like spcminer and that s all you ll need,223,1
  Nice video  I believe everything will play out  I believe this cycle is gonna stretch out till next year  Everyone is assuming crypto is gonna go on massive run this year and because of that  it will not happen  The market sometimes do the opposite of what the majority is expecting  No one knows where the top is going to be  But I can assure that looking at the nature of BTC peaks in past years peak  you see a more violent run up follow by a violent dump  I will advise that we lower our expectation and prioritize trad ing and  hodlingalone  For you to be profitable a trader  you need more than mere knowledge from YouTube videos  I use Ms Melissa Thompson strategy  her knowledge and experience outweighs mine I have been able to grow in knowledge  and also I have been able to increase my portfolio with my initial assets of 2 3 Btc to 9 3 Btc in 4 weeks of trading with her  my advice for advanced and newbies to the crypto world is to contact her and join the moving train  You can contact her onT E L E G R A M   Melissatrade24  I am spreading this for those who are having issues turning in a consistent profit in the market ,3,2
I m going to contact her now  I m so tired of losing ,1,
Best is BitBox2      Trezor HW is not secure   got hacked by Kraken Labs   Especially for multi sig wallets as you will need to confirm the  xpub  address and neither ledger or trezor shows the other owner s xpub on your device   Only BitBox2 does it ,1,1
Wanted to note a quick correction  EIP712 is not the NFT standard  EIP721 ERC721 is the NFT standard  As long as Trezor supports smart contract interaction it will support NFTs  EIP712 is used by smart contracts who want to use signed messages   EDIT  improve spelling,2,2
What if the hardware wallet is broken ,1,3
U have the seedphrase  You buy a new ledger and put your old seedphrase in and itll be there  Its still a hot wallet in a way,1,
that intro    ,1,2
These investment are only bound to make slow profit returns in the current market  I ve come across a few blogs mentioning investors that generated profit of up to  450 000 in 3months and I m eager to know what how I can make such lucrative profit ,43,6
i like the ledger and the trezor the best the metal wallet was neat but more of a novelty,7,2
Techlead  you can allways put your 25 word password and you will have steel backup with plausible deny ability  regular phrase  and have your 25th allways in your head  your welcome,1,2
 While bitcoin s wild price movements might seem random  they are often driven by the same fundamental catalysts as in the traditional markets  Some claim bitcoin is impervious to shocks that affect global finance  it s a hedge against things like inflation and a sure bet against tides of uncertainty  Moves within traditional finance can boost or burn bitcoin s price because they determine how easy it is for financial epicenters like Wall Street to invest in bitcoin   Keeping all this in mind  it is important to trade with the right strategy when going into the crypto world  Jennifer Wilbur has been doing a great job reviewing all chart  trade and techniques on BTC which has enhance the growth of my portfolio to 21 BTC lately ,96,9
Trezor model T      Why haven t you got it lol ,1,1
U didn t mention that there is a transaction fee to move coins to and from the wallets  I had Ledger nano S and still lost funds as the hacker fooled me  So at the end of the day  security is your own level of awareness and savy  If you are trusting and gullible enough you will loose money no matter how good the hardware is  Honestly I think binance has amazing security with 2 factor authentication  Maybe just leave it there ,1,2
Best pay for safety then be sorry  Trust me These hackers wont stop,2,
Thanks for making such a thorough comparison video  This was really helpful and much appreciated ,2,1
if you set up a desktop wallet  backup up the keys etc   and then delete the software  you have a cold wallet ,2,3
Who even is this guy  If he actually  knew anything about crypto he d be a millionaire ,1,1
Just wanted to let you know how much we appreciate that you updated your channel description to keep up with the times    Ex Google   Meta tech lead ,3,1
I think   should be able to reset pass phrase when you first get the hardware wallet        not sure,1,1
I really don t follow crypto currency  but understand many people are ,1,2
I will not let them take my  6 worth of Bitcoin ,39,1
Mind reader  I was just thinking about researching those this weekend ,1,1
And that s why I sold all my Facebook stock to buy a nano s wallet ,3,1
Put seed phrase in new device,1,
Problem with crypto security is small essential details are missed  13th or 25th passphrase is essential to protect the mnemonic phrase   Needs to be pointed out which product offers this security ,7,4
 K otgc nah  The pass phrase is not needed  The pass phrase just lets u have a derived seed    The real security is multi sig as it prevents both a possible collision with another persons seed derivation and it prevents a single device from accessing funds   Passphrase doesn t stop it   Let s face it if you have someone with coercion on you you would give up the pass phrase in a minute  They won t know you need 5  Hardware wallets to get access to ur multi million funds,1,
Patrick you have a massive following  we can go to Japan into the enemy territory and retrieve your child  The million army has your back,5,2
this video did it  ledger it is ,1,2
  hatsapp              this channel has no content  looks like a fake account to me ,1,
Tech lead  Is there any kidney swap available  I desperately need million tokens in exchange for kidneys     ,1,1
Thank you ,1,1
Hey Patrick  really nice comparison  With the fire proof physical metal  wallets  you can use a password protected mnemonic phrase instead of a normal one  most of the hardware wallets do support that  By doing so  even if someone else gets the physical wallet they can read the words but without that password passphrase they can t access the funds contained in the wallet  This feature is part of the BIP39 standard that the wallets app use  the feature is called BIP39 Passphrase   Thanks for the cool content ,13,1
Wow  Change your name from Tech Lead to The Tech Lead   ,1,1
I didn t even know or care about all of this until TechLead made this vid  Now I m all intrigued  Dude is a helluvah salesman ,8,1
Can someone resolve the intrigue  If I install Exodus on USB and keep it in drawer or transfer funds to Exodus and then delete app I have cold storage   My private keys can t be obtained by hacking my pc  and my passphrasse is offline on paper  Ledger and Trezor aswell do not transfer your coins on its devices  you just get private keys while public keys are online so you can restore the wallet just as Exodus   Prove me wrong if I am  but currently it just seems same security level   even USB PIN can be simulated by encrypting the USB ,1,4
  besl lu just by using linux you re 10x more secure  because the script kiddies will be coding for windows   You can still get malware on it though  On your other computer  even if someone can t get your password  if you leave your flash drive connected they can still steal your recovery phrase  which is useless without the password  which they can try to bruteforce   But it s mostly less convenient than using a hardware wallet  You have to reboot  you have to kill networking  etc etc  For 60  it s worth it ,3,
Hardware wallets work by showing you the transaction on screen and having you validate it by pressing a button   Then  the wallet signs the transaction and returns it to the computer  The computer can t sign an arbitrary transaction or get your keys   In your case  if your computer had malware your money would be gone the moment you plugged in your USB stick   Edit  therefore as long as you do no transactions you have the same security  Pretty pointless ,1,
Thank you TechLead as a poorguy ,5,1
For individuals interested in benefiting from the crypto world  especially newbies  you should put more emphasis into day trading  It is less affected by the dynamism of the market and more profitable than hodling  You need to do it right though  I have been able to make over 6 BTC From the initial 1 2 BTC  I started with while implementing trades with signals and strategies from Christine Lark ,4,9
IMO the best video on youtube on the subject  Haven t seen them all but have seen a ton ,4,1
Trezor wins for me ,1,1
Can I have a wallet  ,1,1
great videos as always but in future please don t imitate coffezila and sell keyboards t shirts and rest of your sponsored stuff      as a ex google ex meta tech genius u sure act like coffezila more and more      what u can do instead is make videos about dexes compound interest staking and defi which are hot now     will give you more street cred      i believe in you also       where is your ex wife talk and her toxic personality i miss that in your videos don t tell me u given up on her,1,1
to keep your funds safu xD,1,1
Sir  Mr Techlead  Please could you do a video on your favorite cryptocurrencies   ,2,1
Binance X Million token,2,2
Nice keyboard xD,2,2
I m using Trezor one  because they have open hardware  so you don t need to trust them at all ,2,1
u forgot the bitbox   ,1,1
I also use Ledger  got like 3 of them  overall good product    Nice video  it seems that I went with the right choice ,5,3
 Peter Muhoho you use the key phrase to reopen your damaged wallet in a new wallet,2,
What happens when you loose the physical wallet or it gets damaged ,1,
Ledger all the way  Great service and great app,5,1
Trevor honestly looks and feels the best experience  Going to get the new version or whenever they update it ,8,0
I ve been liking the Trezor model one for purchasing Million Token  I may pick up a ledger nano X as well just to see how I like it  Great video ,7,4
Research Battery problems with the X series  I returned both of mine,1,
Hey Patrick  i hope you are well  Your last video got me worried that depression might be after you  Hang in there no matter what  brighter days are ahead i assure you  We love you and want to see you happy,58,7
Lots of people struggling  Techlead is awesome and wishing him well ,2,
Techlead s videos are often times used as cryptic messages to his friends foes or people in the past  imo he may not be fully aware of it maybe it is depression  I ve been critical of the guy for sure but when it comes down to it the guys is not just intellectualy smart he s hella street smart  My life has gotten better since tuning into his videos   The  milliontoken community admires him  Well mostly everyone  ,4,
Yes we love tech lead  I suffer from depression too so I know how he feels and I hope he pulls through it s really not that bad ,1,
I m guessing you couldn t get a model T in stock anywhere either  You showed Trezor One  Another good suggestion is to keep metal wallet in an evidence bag with tamper proof seal ,8,1
Best YouTuber,2,1
Was waiting for your video on wallet,1,1
Remember when TL wasn t just another memecoin shill and actually made entertaining videos  Pepperidge Farm remembers,2,1
Six month later   TL   Why I m switching over to software wallets after my HW wallet got damaged hacked bricked,4,2
Let me guess  Trezor because Million token,1,1
Hey i wanted to start coding do you have any books that would be good that aren t outdated   As you said every 2 years the code has to be revamped on average it s always changing so a book would be difficult right  ,3,1

Letsss goo TL  LFG MILLION   ,3,1
